    "summary": "The race to decarbonize passenger cars and light-duty trucks in the U.S. is accelerating. Battery electric vehicles accounted for almost \n6% of all new vehicle sales\n in 2022, up from close to 3% in 2021, and \ndemand is outstripping supply,\n even as manufacturers roll out new models and designs. The Biden administration is spending billions of dollars to \nbuild out EV charging networks\n and providing incentives for purchasing new and used EVs.\n\u00a0\u00a0This shift offers big economic and environmental benefits, but they're not spread equitably. People who bear the most burdens in our current transportation systems often receive the fewest benefits and are least able to change their situations.\n\u00a0\u00a0I study \nthe future of clean transportation and energy,\n and my research \nanalyzes equity considerations\n in the design of these systems. As my colleagues and I see it, an equitable transition will require thinking broadly about all transportation users and their needs \u2013 especially those who are currently being left behind.\nHere are four issues that we believe should be front and center:\nBanning gas-powered cars can have unintended consequences\n\u00a0\u00a0California has banned sales of \nnew gas-powered passenger cars and light-duty trucks\n starting in 2035, and other states are \nfollowing suit.\n Without the right support, these bans could hurt communities that are underserved by current transportation systems.\n\u00a0\u00a0At the end of 2022, the average price of a new battery EV was \naround $61,500,\n compared with an average of $49,500 for all new cars. Less-expensive models are \nstarting to reach the market,\n but EVs remain out of financial reach for many people.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nFederal tax credits\n of up to $7,500 for new EVs or $4,000 for used ones come with manufacturer restrictions, income thresholds and vehicle price caps. For now, the policy does not offer discounts at the time of purchase, so upfront costs remain high and often prohibitive for many buyers.\n\u00a0\u00a0These bans may affect markets for used gas-powered cars, and it's unclear whether states will provide support for people who can't transition immediately to EVs. Used car prices are already at \nunprecedented highs\n due to \ninflation and global supply chain issues\n affecting the new car market. Bans on new gas-powered cars could further boost prices in the used market, as long as those models are cheaper than EVs.\n\u00a0\u00a0Supporting industries, such as repair shops, gas stations, and auto dealerships, could also be affected. These businesses, which provide services and jobs in their communities, could be displaced in the shift to EVs, which \nrequire less maintenance\n than gas-powered cars and have different supply chains and support systems.\n\u00a0\u00a0The Biden administration has pledged that shifting to EVs \nwill create high-quality jobs.\n However, many parts of the auto industry and workforce development systems \nneed to evolve\n to ensure that workers benefit from this process.\nGas-powered cars will keep polluting for years\n\u00a0\u00a0Bans on sales of new gas-powered vehicles won't affect those that are already on the road. \nOne-third of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions\n come from the transportation sector. Cars and light-duty trucks produce \nalmost two-thirds of that share,\n which makes them a major driver of climate change.\n\u00a0\u00a0They also emit air pollutants, notably fine particulates, that can cause premature deaths and illnesses, including cardiovascular disease, asthma, and other respiratory ailments. Studies show that fine particle pollution \ndisproportionately burdens communities of color.\n\u00a0\u00a0Gas-powered cars can remain on the road for up to 30 years. Given their harmful health effects, I believe that waiting for the U.S. auto fleet to naturally turn over to zero-emission vehicles is not acceptable.\n\u00a0\u00a0There aren't many mechanisms today to encourage drivers to shift away from old, dirty cars. The federal CARS program, also known as 'Cash for Clunkers,' ran for a few months in 2009 and offered rebates of up to $4,500 to drivers who turned in older vehicles for more fuel-efficient new or used cars. However, this program delivered modest emission reductions relative to its cost\n\u00a0\u00a0What's more, older vehicles often are shipped abroad for resale. According to a United Nations report, the U.S. is one of the top three global exporters of used cars. In addition to increasing scrapping and recycling of older, high-emitting cars, I see a need for coordinated international regulations to ensure safe and sustainable trade of used vehicles, as the U.N. report recommended.\nEV incentives don't go to underserved drivers\n\u00a0\u00a0Benefits to promote EV adoption often aren't accessible to those who need them most. A 2020 study funded by the U.S. Department of Transportation found that low-income households in Atlanta were less likely to benefit from state and federal EV incentives than higher-income households because the incentives were awarded as \ncredits against income taxes owed.\n This is also how current federal tax credits are structured.\n\u00a0\u00a0In a \npaper currently under review,\n colleagues and I show that to date in California, EV adoption and rebate rates are lower in zip codes whose residents are majority low-income and populations of color as well as in formerly redlined neighborhoods.\n\u00a0\u00a0\nIn another study,\n we examined an \nequity mobility program in California\n that was designed to help low-income households purchase zero-emission vehicles. We found that the program didn't fully work as intended because the application process was complex, imposed challenging timelines, and offered applicants limited support.\n\u00a0\u00a0California has enacted \nnew legislation\n that will expand this program statewide, and we look forward to seeing updates and improvements.\nRural areas face unique transportation challenges\n\u00a0\u00a0Almost one-fifth of Americans \nlive in rural areas,\n where they typically \ndrive more\n than city dwellers, have sparse access to public transit, and often rely on private vehicles. Members of our research group have interviewed rural residents who don't own cars and rely on one bus a day to get to the nearest doctor's office or grocery store.\n\u00a0\u00a0So far, policies intended to promote the EV transition have not focused on rural areas, although the Department of Transportation has launched an initiative \nfocusing on these communities' needs.\n Rural residents are concerned about the availability of charging infrastructure, economic development, and EVs that fit rural residents' needs, and in my view, they deserve targeted support.\nIn a car-centric society, who does the EV transition serve?\n\u00a0\u00a0The U.S. is a \ncar-centric society\n where most people need access to an automobile to live their lives effectively. Many years of \npolicies and investments\n have produced a system that focuses on helping drivers reach their destinations as quickly as possible rather than other objectives like clean air or reliable public transit.\n\u00a0\u00a0By doing so, the system \nvalues the time of drivers\n more than that of people who rely on other modes of transit. Americans with access to cars have \nmore freedom and more choice\n about where and how to pursue an education, work, and spend time with loved ones.\n\u00a0\u00a0Surveys show that Americans who are lower-income, Black, Hispanic, or immigrants are \nespecially likely to use public transit regularly.\n Today, mass transit systems are \nin decline across the U.S.\n thanks to pandemic ridership decreases that have worsened the effects of long-term underfunding.\n\u00a0\u00a0In my view, the EV transition should be part of a broader shift to clean mobility that invests in \npublic transit,\n walking, and biking as well as systems like EV charging that support private car use. New clean mobility systems should be designed so that all Americans have safe and reliable options for getting to their destinations.\n\u00a0 \nAbout the author:\n Sita M.

D'Angelo Robinson Sr., 35, was booked into the Muscogee County Jail on eight counts of aggravated assault.\nPolice Chief Freddie Blackmon said at a news conference a day after the shooting that an altercation apparently took place at a party nearby and it spilled over to the gas station when the shooting began. Further details were not provided, but Blackmon said the incident remained under investigation.\nPolice have said the youngest victim, who is 5 years old, was not at the party but was in the vicinity of the gas station with a family member.\nColumbus is located about 110 miles (177 kilometers) southwest of Atlanta and about 85 miles (137 kilometers) east of Montgomery, Alabama.",

    "excerpt": "ATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 13, 2023 / Metro Atlanta, like other major cities across the southeast saw unprecedented real estate growth over the past couple of years and while home prices have\u2026",
    "summary": "ATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 13, 2023 / Metro Atlanta, like other major cities across the southeast saw unprecedented real estate growth over the past couple of years and while home prices have leveled off, mortgage rates have increased, leaving some buyers reluctant to move forward with a home purchase. So, what does this mean for someone who is considering a new home? Lori Lane, President of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Georgia Properties' New Homes Division gives some insight.\n\"My team and I work with some of the most respected builders all across the Atlanta Metro area,\" said Lori Lane, \"I am often asked if it is still a good time to buy a new home or should I wait? My question is what are you waiting for?\"\nFirst, it's important to understand what is happening in today's housing market. The inventory level of homes in Atlanta is still at a record low with a deficit of 63,000 homes according to MarketNsights, John Hunt, and total inventory is now at the lowest level in seven months. A main reason the predicted collapse in home prices did not materialize. This is reinforced by Lawrence Yun, chief economist, and senior VP of research at the National Association of Realtors (NAR) who said, \"even with a projected reduction in home sales this year, prices are expected to remain stable in the vast majority of markets due to extremely limited supply. Mortgage rates have trended down, and the new normal is 5.5% - 6.5%. So\u2026for someone waiting for a 3% or 4% mortgage rate, it's not going to happen.\"\nSo, what does this mean for someone contemplating buying a new home? Today's buyers need to realize that prices are not going to drastically drop. If you are sitting on the sidelines anticipating lower prices you may end up disappointed. In fact, home prices will continue to increase over time. According to NAR, historically, real estate has had a long-term, stable growth in value with median single-family existing-home sale prices increasing on average 5.2 percent each year since 1972.\nThe next question is usually about waiting for interest rates to change. Atlanta continues to be one of the most desirable places to live in the country, According to economists at NAR, the metro Atlanta area is the best possible place to buy a house in 2023 based on a variety of factors. Buyers will continue to relocate here and when rates drop, more buyers will jump back into the market. With so little inventory that could put us back to multiple offer scenarios which will drive home prices up. Instead of being outbid for the home you want, go get the home you want now and refinance later when rates decrease.\nI, of course, recommend new construction for several reasons. Many home builders are currently offering incentives including interest rate buy downs, 30-year fixed interest rates as low as 4.99%, which can reduce your monthly house payment by hundreds if not thousands of dollars. In addition, some will pay towards closing costs, so you need less cash up front. Some builders offer move-in appliance packages as an incentive to help reduce the cost of big purchases. New construction gives you updated features, brand new appliances, a new roof, a builders warranty along with vendor warranties. A new home is often more energy efficient bringing costs down even more. So before more people jump back into the market and you have even fewer homes to choose from, remember Builders have some inventory out there and homesites you can build your dream home on. To sum it all up, the best deal you are going to get on your new home may be right now.\nAbout New Homes BBHSGA:\nThe New Homes Division of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Georgia Properties represents some of the most respected builders and developers in the Greater Atlanta area.

    "excerpt": "Protests have intensified in Atlanta, Ga., over plans to build a new police training center, resulting in recent violence at the site dubbed 'Cop City.' Thirty-five people were detained by police on\u2026",
    "summary": "Protests have intensified in Atlanta, Ga., over plans to build a new police training center, resulting in recent violence at the site dubbed 'Cop City.'\nThirty-five people were detained by police on Sunday after what the Atlanta Police Department called 'a group of violent agitators' clashed with authorities, and 23 people were charged with domestic terrorism over the incident.\nHere's what you need to know about the protests:\nProtesters are demonstrating against the proposed Atlanta Public Safety Training Center, a training campus for officers that would include a shooting range, a nature trail and a 'mock village' for cops to practice raids.\nThe $90 million, 85-acre project was approved by the Atlanta City Council back in 2021 and is in part an effort to 'improve morale, retention and recruitment' for Atlanta law enforcement, according to the project's description from the\u00a0nonprofit Atlanta Police Foundation.\nThe protesters represent a variety of interests. Some are against the militarization of police, while others are against the environmental impact of construction on the forested land on which the new facilities are set to be built.\nThe demonstrations against the police training center come against the backdrop of major protests in Atlanta more than two years ago after the brutal killing of George Floyd at the hands of police \u2014 which spurred many to leave the force, as reported by the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\nProtests against the planned site have been going on since it was announced. Authorities fatally shot a man who injured a state trooper during an attempt to clear out the site back in January, and demonstrations cropped up in downtown Atlanta later that month, near the Atlanta Police Foundation.\nProtests escalated further on Sunday when, according to police, individuals dressed in black 'used the cover of a peaceful protest' to 'conduct a coordinated attack on construction equipment and police officers.'\nThe protesters entered the construction area for the training center and 'began to throw large rocks, bricks, Molotov cocktails and fireworks at police officers,' and ultimately 'destroyed multiple pieces of construction equipment by fire and vandalism,' according to a release from the department.\nAtlanta Police Department chief Darin Schierbaum called the most recent incident a 'very violent attack' aimed at police.\n'This was a very violent attack that occurred this evening. Very violent attack. This wasn't about a public safety training center, this was about anarchy and this was about the attempt to destabilize,' Schierbaum said.\nAdditional protests are reportedly planned for the coming days, and police say they're prepared to respond with 'a multi-layered strategy that includes reaction and arrest.'\n'This movement is resisting unbridled police authoritarianism & racist brutality. The Atlanta Police are out of control. They call in Georgia State Patrol as their shocktroops. They have killed a protestor, attacked a music festival, and charged dozens with domestic terrorism,' posted Defend the Atlanta Forest,\u00a0a social media site used by members of the movement.\nAmnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a number of other groups have called for the domestic terrorism charges against those detained over the weekend to be dropped.\nGeorgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) declared a state of emergency in January after protests over the activist's death during the clear-out attempt.\nKemp said after Sunday's violence that 'domestic terrorism will NOT be tolerated in this state' and that law enforcement's 'bravery should be celebrated' in their response to this weekend's violence.\nFollowing the January protests and the death of the activist, Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens affirmed the city supports the right to peaceful protest but said they would 'not tolerate violence or property destruction.'\nRep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) has blamed Antifa for the incident and, on Tuesday, introduced a resolution to declare the group as a terrorist organization.\n'Last weekend, Antifa rioters firebombed the future police training facility in Atlanta. Antifa has been terrorizing Americans for years, and it's time to end the lawlessness,' Greene said on the House floor.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "The Atlanta Police Department announced the arrests of 23 people following a music festival that turned into a violent protest at the location where Atlanta plans to build a police and fire training facility.\nOn Sunday, around 5:30 p.m., police said a group of violent agitators used the cover of a peaceful protest to create a coordinated attack on construction equipment and police officers at the proposed Atlanta Public Safety Training Center.\nAtlanta officials stated the group changed into all black, went inside the construction area, and threw large rocks, bricks, Molotov cocktails, and fireworks at law enforcement.\n'This is not a protest,' APD officials said at a press conference Sunday night. 'This wasn't about a public training center; this was about anarchy.'\nWe're working to learn more about those arrested, starting on Channel 2 Action News at 4:00 p.m.\nAuthorities said the illegal activity could have resulted in bodily harm; no injuries were reported.\nOfficers have arrested a total of 23 people.

    "excerpt": "Loudermilk Homes has been selected as a finalist for Custom Builder of the Year by the National Association of Home Builders.ATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 2, 2023 / Loudermilk Homes was named as\u2026",
    "summary": "Loudermilk Homes has been selected as a finalist for Custom Builder of the Year by the National Association of Home Builders.\nATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 2, 2023 / Loudermilk Homes was named as one of the top three finalists for the national award by the NAHB's Custom Home Builders Committee, which recognizes the leadership and contributions of the best builders in the country. The award was presented during this year's International Builders' Show in Las Vegas. \"Our entire team at Loudermilk Homes feels immensely honored to be named as a finalist for Custom Builder of the Year, and this recognition underscores the hard work, attention to detail, disciplined processes, and custom craftsmanship that we strive to infuse in every home that we design and build,\" said Sherwin Loudermilk, Founder and President of Loudermilk Homes.\nIn 2009, Loudermilk Homes was founded in Atlanta by Sherwin Loudermilk and his wife and business partner Roane Loudermilk. Since then, the company has expanded its reach throughout metro Atlanta and North Carolina, gaining recognition as one of the top luxury custom design and build firms in the region. On average, Loudermilk Homes completes around 15 homes annually, and is simultaneously in the process of planning around 30 to 40 additional homes at any given time. Currently, the company has numerous active development projects including The Manor Golf & Country Club, The Homestead at Milton, and Von Lake Estates situated just north of Atlanta. In addition, the company has various projects located in Cashiers/Highlands, North Carolina such as Saratay Falls, Bear Mor, Cedar Hill, High Hampton, and Lonesome Valley. Loudermilk Homes also specializes in building custom homes in high-end intown neighborhoods such as Buckhead and Sandy Springs, along with more established neighborhoods like Atlanta Country Club.\nLoudermilk Homes is renowned for incorporating both modern and classic design elements into their homes, utilizing cutting-edge smart home technology and high-quality materials. The company's open layouts imbue a sense of grandeur, and they have in-house architectural design services to ensure faster revisions that avoid project delays. Loudermilk Designs, the company's sister organization established by President Roane Loudermilk, offers design professionals who work collaboratively with each client to select finishes and materials that reflect the client's individual aesthetic preferences.\nTo help minimize stress and make the design and construction process more enjoyable for their clients, Loudermilk Homes has developed a \"Process to Perfection\" consisting of nine comprehensive steps. The company provides each client with access to Loudermilk Connect, a project management portal powered by Buildertrend, which ensures complete transparency regarding the schedule and budget. The portal includes daily work logs, photographs, a live 24/7 video stream, the ability to approve change orders from any touch screen device, and an archive of all selections that were made before the start of construction.\nLoudermilk Homes has a structured and methodical pre-construction process that sets out clear decision-making processes and project milestones that need to be achieved before a project can move forward. The company advises homeowners to make all selections prior to the commencement of the project, which is similar to how commercial projects are handled. This approach helps to mitigate global supply chain delays and shortages.\nSherwin Loudermilk has been an engaged leader and member of an NAHB Builder 20 peer learning group, known as \"The Doors,\" for multiple years. These gatherings provide a platform for business owners from some of the country's leading builders to exchange ideas and best practices, offer constructive feedback, review financial and operational metrics, and encourage each other to enhance their personal and professional lives. The group engages in both formal meetings and informal conversations throughout the year.\nLoudermilk acknowledged the crucial role of their NAHB Builder 20 Group in the success of Loudermilk Homes, stating that \"Without the support, encouragement, thought leadership, and candid feedback from every member of our group, Loudermilk Homes wouldn't be where it is today. The way we challenge and push each other to do our best work is invaluable, and I owe an enormous debt of gratitude to each of them.\"\nLoudermilk Homes is highly committed to giving back to the local communities where it operates. The company is a proud member of the Atlanta CBUSA chapter and the Chamber of Commerce in Cashiers, NC. It also donates to Noor charity to support refugees who have been displaced due to geopolitical unrest, helping them to rebuild their lives. In addition, as part of its \"Employee of the Quarter\" recognition program, Loudermilk Homes makes a charitable donation to an organization of the employee's choice. Recent recipients have included the Northside Hospital Foundation, Atlanta Humane Society, Glenville-Cashiers Rescue Squad, and the American Red Cross.\nLoudermilk expressed his humility and gratitude at being selected as a finalist for Custom Builder of the Year and credited every member of the Loudermilk Homes and Loudermilk Designs family for this honor.\nABOUT LOUDERMILK HOMES\nIn 2009, former IBM executive Sherwin Loudermilk founded Loudermilk Homes, an award-winning luxury homebuilder that follows a proprietary 9-Step \"Process to Perfection\" to ensure quality custom craftsmanship and complete transparency on every project. The company integrates top-of-the-line smart home technology that can be controlled through Amazon Alexa, and its Loudermilk Connect app allows homebuyers to view real-time video feeds, approve change orders, and monitor budgets and schedules from any device 24/7. Loudermilk Homes has been recognized with numerous awards from prestigious publications such as the Greater Atlanta Home Builders Association, Modern Luxury Interiors, City Lifestyle, Houzz, and others.\nAbout New Homes BBHSGA:\nThe New Homes Division of Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Georgia Properties represents some of the most respected builders and developers in the Greater Atlanta area.

    "summary": "Atlanta, GA - (NewMediaWire) - February 16, 2023 - via QC Kinetix - With chronic pain prevalence estimated at a worrisome twenty percent of America's populace, the nation is staring at a significant problem that needs addressing sooner rather than later. Regardless of their causes and depending on their severity, such conditions have the power to upend victims' lives if left unchecked. Whereas minor injuries can be resolved using traditional methods such as resting, icing, compression, and elevation, more severe ones require unique treatments for effective recovery. Until recently, the options for chronic pain patients were limited to surgeries and pain medications, with neither choice being ideal due to their glaring deficiencies. Luckily, QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs) now offers a third alternative that addresses these shortcomings. QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs) provides regenerative medicine therapies that leverage patients' natural self-defense mechanisms to promote restoration and alleviate pain. The clinic's team of treatment providers achieves this by directly administering all-natural biologic factors to the affected body parts, which then triggers and enhances the patient's immune response to address the condition at its root. This approach is far superior to simply masking the symptoms of pain with medication, as it tackles the underlying cause of the issue. Additionally, it offers hope to patients who have been relying on pain medication, as they can begin to safely reduce their reliance on drugs with harmful side effects.Despite progressive advances in conventional medicine, going under the knife is often the last thing most people resort to after exhausting other options for their pain conditions. Often, the most significant concerns about such procedures are their extended downtimes (from post-surgical wounds) and associated risks. Chronic pain patients from Atlanta, Georgia, and the surrounding areas will be happy to know that a visit to QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs) may be just what they need to avoid the operating room. The clinic's regenerative medicine therapies are typically minimally disruptive to patients' everyday lives, with many patients reporting being able to go about their regular routines immediately after and between subsequent treatments. While commenting on their experience at QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs), one recovered patient said, \"My shoulder started to bother me in September of 2021. So much so I could no longer play golf or even sleep on my right side. After seeing a traditional doctor in April of 2021, his only solution was a cortisone shot which I did, but it did nothing for me. I had heard the ads for QC Kinetix on the radio and thought, why not give it a try? I made an appointment and listened closely to their treatment plan. After my first appointment, I was able to play golf again and have been feeling like a new man ever since.\"Besides helping pain patients alleviate pain and restore lost or impeded body functions, the treatment providers at QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs) focus on assisting them in maintaining optimal health for as long as possible. This is why they always go above and beyond to tailor their treatments to each patient's condition and minimize re-injury risks. For improved service delivery, the providers begin every new appointment with a free 30 to 60-minute consultation session to lay the groundwork for the entire treatment process. Such sessions are inclusive of relevant tests and medical examinations, which help determine the patient's eligibility for regenerative medicine treatments.Research and scientific evidence has shown regenerative medicine to be suitable for treating various chronic pain conditions, including those from severe medical conditions such as arthritis and tendon injuries. Its widespread applications in sports have earned QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs) a reputation as a go-to Sandy Springs sports injury clinic. Patients suffering from foot, ankle, toe, calf, knee, thigh, hip, shoulder, elbow, wrist, hand, finger, and lower & upper back pain in Atlanta need only visit QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs) to kick start their journey back to health and wellness.More information regarding the regenerative medicine therapies offered at QC Kinetix (Sandy Springs) is available on the clinic's website.

Video from FOX 5 Atlanta shows a bulldozer and other pieces of equipment on fire.\nThe training facility is located in southeast Atlanta on Key Road, where protestors opposing the construction of the facility clashed with police. A Georgia State Trooper told the outlet that a Molotov cocktail was thrown.\nATLANTA'S FUTURE POLICE TRAINING FACILITY \u2018COP CITY' SET ABLAZE\nIn 2021, the City Council approved spending $90 million on the training center in an effort to replace substandard offerings and increase police morale hurt by hiring and retention following the 2020 protests against the death of George Floyd.\n\nProtesters self-described as \"forest defenders\" and a progressive group called \"Stop Cop City\" argue that the new facility being built in the wooded parts of Atlanta will cause a loss of trees detrimental to the environment, and that it would promote the militarization of the police.\nProtesters in June 2021 began camping in the section of woods designated for the training facility.\nAt least 19 people have been arrested and charged with domestic terrorism since December in connection with protests against the training facility.\nSix of those arrests were made in response to a riot in downtown Atlanta on Jan. 21 that began after Georgia State Patrol shot and killed environmental activist Manuel Esteban Paez Teran during efforts to clear protesters from the area. The activist had shot a trooper in the abdomen before officers returned fire.\nGreene claimed in a separate tweet on Sunday that Antifa was behind the attack on the Public Safety Training Facility.\n\n\"This is domestic terrorism. It was planned for weeks and announced on social media. Antifa are self proclaimed communists and consistently organize to attack our government over and over again. They should be taken seriously and not tolerated anymore,\" she wrote.\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., similarly introduced a resolution in 2021 to designate Antifa a terrorist organization, but it failed to receive any traction in the House, which was controlled by Democrats at the time.\nFox News' Greg Wehner contributed to this report",

At the end of a two-lap dash to the finish, Kligerman\u2018s Chevrolet turned sideways across the front bumper of Hemric\u2018s car and hit the right rear of Hill\u2018s No. 21 Richard Childress Racing Chevy.\nHill maintained control and took the checkered flag with Hemric trailing by .085 seconds. Kligerman slid backward across the finish line in fourth, as Ryan Truex edged him for the third spot by .001 seconds.\n'They knew we were here,' Kligerman radioed to his Big Machine Racing team.\nThe defending race winner, Hill came to Atlanta with victories at Daytona and Las Vegas and, understandably, the Xfinity Series lead. The win was Hill\u2018s second at Atlanta and the fifth of his career.\nThe only thing that shook Hill all night was the contact with the right rear of his car in the final 100 yards.\n'I have no idea how I saved it coming to the line,' Hill said, after his young daughter ran out to greet him at the finish line. 'What a start to the season. Everybody at Richard Childress Racing, ECR engines \u2014 we\u2018ve just had such a fast start with Chevrolet. This has been special, for sure.'\nMORE: Weekend schedule\nRiley Herbst finished fifth, followed by Brett Moffitt, Josh Berry, John Hunter Nemechek, Sam Mayer and Justin Haley.\nHill won the first stage, and Kligerman gave Big Machine its first-ever stage victory in the second.\nJosh Williams\u2018 No. 92 DGM Racing Chevrolet sustained damage in a Lap 27 accident with the No. 02 Chevy of Kyle Weatherman, and when Williams dropped debris on the frontstretch to cause the fourth caution moments after the subsequent Lap 32 restart, NASCAR officials parked him under the Damaged Vehicle Policy.\nInstead of driving his car to the garage, however, a frustrated Williams parked it at the start/finish line. NASCAR ordered Williams to the hauler for a discussion of the incident, after he was released from the infield care center. Team owner Mario Gosselin and No. 92 crew chief Bryan Berry were also summoned for consultation.\nThe Xfinity Series' next race is scheduled next Saturday, March 26 (3:30 p.m. ET, FOX, PRN, SiriusXM) at Circuit of The Americas.\nContributing: Staff reports",

    "summary": "In just four years, the signature smashburger at NFA Burger in Dunwoody has reached legendary status.\nTara Massouleh McCay\nI've never been precious about where I dine. I've learned over the years that a white tablecloth can be deceiving, and sometimes the best culinary treasures are hidden in the most unlikely of places. Many of my favorite meals have been eaten at rickety tables, with tissue-thin paper napkins, flimsy plastic forks, and not so much as a whisper of air-conditioning.\nSo, when I heard buzz about an Atlanta-suburb gas station serving not only the city's, but the state's best burger, I had to check it out for myself. For the trip, I diverted from my typical Atlanta dining destination of Buford Highway and drove 15 minutes to NFA Burger in nearby Dunwoody. Here, the term 'gas-station restaurant' is a little misleading. The Chevron where NFA Burger makes its home is more akin to a suburban single-family home than a fueling station. Yes, there are gas pumps outside and walls of soft drinks and candy inside, but you'll also find it to be spotlessly clean with homey details like a red-brick fa\u00e7ade, arched entries, and dormers.\nI ordered two the Classic Double Burger and Sassy Fries and took them over to NFA's dining room\u2014a set of white picnic tables huddled under the merciful shade of a giant tree. The burger components were simple but impactful\u2014two 2.75-ounce Certified Angus Beef patties, pickles, American cheese, mustard, and Sassy Sauce on a Martin's Potato Roll. I was immediately impressed by the suppleness of the bun and eager to taste the crispy bits of patty peeking out. When I bit in, everything tasted exactly as it should. The bun was buttery and slightly sweet, the pickles and mustard lended a bit of tang to the unctuous beef patties smothered in melty American cheese, and the sweet-but-slightly-spicy Sassy Sauce brought it all together without overpowering any other flavors. The real star, though, was the lacey almost caramelized patty skirt. At $8 for a double burger, plus $4 and change for fries and Sassy Sauce, I was pleased with the amount and certainly the quality of the food for the price.\nThe only thing as good as the food at NFA Burger is the story behind it. Burnt out from his demanding career in advertising, Dunwoody resident Billy Kramer brought some levity to his weekly travels by embarking on a quest to find the country's best burger. He started an Instagram called @billysburgers where he sampled burgers from around the country and talked to chefs about how they were made.\nEventually, he developed a recipe for his own ultimate burger. After a few friends raved about it, he experimented bringing it to pop-ups around Atlanta. In December 2019, NFA Burger\u2014which stands for Not Fooling Around\u2014opened inside the tiny kitchen and caf\u00e9 counter at the Chevron off Chamblee Dunwoody Road.\nOver the next few years, the business blossomed both locally and nationally. Weekend lines often extended into the parking lot and regulars grew at an alarmingly rate. Then, Food & Wine named NFA's the Best Burger in Georgia; Thrillist added NFA to its Best Burgers in America list; and Business Insider named NFA Georgia's Favorite Burger.\n'I never thought of being able to be featured in Southern Living, or having famous chefs and CEOs come by for a burger,' says owner Billy Kramer.\nSome of Kramer's earliest childhood memories revolve around eating burgers, so he says getting to build a place where families can create memories has been one of the greatest joys of opening NFA Burger. 'The other day, a mom brought her son and mother in for lunch,' says Kramer. 'The child was picking at his grilled cheese and not real happy. It turns out, he was upset that his mom and grandmother were eating a burger\u2014big boy food\u2014and he wasn't having it. Picking up on his tone, I went inside and made him a kid's version of our burger. He loved it. As it turns out, it was his very first burger. They will always remember that\u2026and so will I.'\nHe's also using his platform to give back to the community with events like the Burger Benefit, a burger cook-off featuring celebrity chefs that will benefit The Giving Kitchen nonprofit. As for the future of the \"little gas station burger that could\", the narrative is heading toward a slight revision. Later this year, the business will relocated to a 600-square-foot restaurant attached to the very same gas station where NFA Burger made its name.\nFor more Southern Living news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\nRead the original article on Southern Living.",

    "summary": "A landmark deal to move forward with the new Atlanta Public Safety Training Center with protections for the community and forest has been reached in principle between the City of Atlanta, DeKalb County, and the Atlanta Police Foundation, according to a source familiar with the negotiation, who spoke with\u00a0Channel 2\u2032s Mark Winne.\nSTORY: DeSantis: Special session on Disney's Reedy Creek expected next week\nThe agreement was officially announced Tuesday afternoon.\nThe training center for Atlanta police and fire would be on city-owned land, which is located off Key Road in DeKalb County. The Atlanta Police Foundation has been raising money to fund it.\nThe training center has been the focus of intense controversy. On one side, it would improve the relationship between police and the community with better training, including training that would produce better outcomes in potentially violent encounters between police and suspects. The opposition has come from environmentalists concerned about trees on the site, others are concerned about noise in the community, and others are opposed to growing the law enforcement footprint in society.\nSTORY: Police say standoff with suspect in Oregon torture case has been \u2018resolved'\nFor decades, the Atlanta police firing range and bomb disposal range have been located nearby.\n'The training center will sit on land that has long been cleared of hardwood trees through previous uses of this site decades ago,' Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said Tuesday.\nThe training facility will take up approximately 85 acres of land, but leave the remaining approximately 300 acres of the lot as untouched greenspace.\nDickens also said that developers have promised to replace any hardwood tree destroyed during construction with 100 more.\nSTORY: \u2018Needle in a haystack find:' Missing radioactive capsule found in Australian outback\nThe controversy about the site peaked when Manuel Teran, who friends called Tortuguita, died after being shot by Georgia State Patrol troopers during a raid on Jan. 18. The Georgia Bureau of Investigation said Teran fired a gun at a trooper without warning and critically injured him.\nFriends and fellow protesters of Teran have repeatedly claimed to\u00a0Channel 2 Action News\u00a0that they were peacefully protesting. They have questioned the GBI's version of events.\nSTORY: \u2018Not physically capable': Ozzy Osbourne cancels tour\nThe GBI said during a multi-agency operation that began that day at the future training center site, approximately 25 campsites were located and removed, and mortar-style fireworks, multiple-edged weapons, pellet rifles, gas masks, and a blow torch were recovered.\nThe GBI said seven people were arrested and charged with domestic terrorism and criminal trespass. Of the seven, none were from metro Atlanta.\nThe following Saturday, an additional six people were arrested after a protest in downtown Atlanta turned violent. Of the six, only one was from metro Atlanta.\nCLICK HERE for the original WSB-TV article.\nSTAY UPDATED:\u00a0Download the Action News Jax app for live updates on breaking stories",

(AP) \u2014 An environmental activist who was fatally shot in a confrontation with Georgia law enforcement in January was sitting cross-legged with their hands in the air at the time, the protester's family said Monday as they released results of an autopsy they commissioned.\nThe family of Manuel Paez Ter\u00e1n held a news conference in Decatur to announce the findings and the filing of an open-records lawsuit seeking to force Atlanta police to release more evidence about the Jan. 18 killing of Paez Ter\u00e1n, who went by the name Tortuguita and used the pronoun they.\nThe family's attorneys said the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, which has been probing the shooting for nearly two months, has prevented Atlanta police from releasing additional evidence to the family.\n'Manuel was looking death in the face, hands raised when killed,' civil rights attorney Brian Spears said, citing the autopy's conclusions. 'We do not stand here today telling you that we know what happened. The second autopsy is a snapshot of what happened, but it is not the whole story. What we want is simple: GBI, meet with the family and release the investigative report.'\nIn a statement, the bureau said it's preventing 'inappropriate release of evidence,' to preserve the integrity of the investigation.\nAuthorities have said officers killed Paez Ter\u00e1n after the 26-year-old shot and seriously injured a state trooper while officers cleared activists from an Atlanta-area forest where officials plan to build a huge police and firefighter training center. The GBI statement says the investigation continues to support the agency's initial assessment of what happened.",

    "excerpt": "The Westside project has been waiting for years to access federal funds to help cleanup dangerous levels of lead found across several properties.",
    "summary": "Projects to clean up 22 toxic waste sites across the country will receive $1 billion from the federal Superfund program to help clear a backlog of hazardous sites such as landfills, mines and manufacturing facilities, the Environmental Protection Agency said Friday.\nThe money is the second installment in $3.5 billion appropriated under\u00a0the 2021 infrastructure law signed by President Joe Biden.\u00a0Sites targeted for cleanup include a lead-contaminated neighborhood on Atlanta's Westside and a former dry cleaning solvents distributor in Tampa, Florida.\nThe money also will be used to speed cleanup of 100 ongoing Superfund projects across the United States, the EPA said. The agency has vowed to clear a longtime backlog in\u00a0the Superfund program, which was established in 1980 to clean up sites contaminated with hazardous substances. The program has languished for years because of a lack of funding.\nThe\u00a0EPA announced an initial $1 billion in funding from the infrastructure law in December 2021.\nWhile the agency is moving faster to clean up contaminated sites in communities across the country, 'our work is not yet finished,' EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement Friday. 'We're continuing to build on this momentum to ensure that communities living near many of the most serious uncontrolled or abandoned releases of contamination finally get the investments and protections they deserve.'\nOf the new cleanup sites announced on Friday, 60% are in low-income or minority communities that are chronically over-polluted, Regan said.\nRELATED STORIES:\nIt could take $50 million and a decade to clean up lead contamination on Atlanta's Westside\nEPA widens lead testing area in Atlanta\nDangerous levels of lead found in soil in Atlanta neighborhood\nThousands of contaminated sites exist across the country as a result of hazardous waste being dumped \u2014 often illegally \u2014 left out in the open, or otherwise improperly managed, including in manufacturing facilities, processing plants, landfills and mining sites.\nSuperfund cleanups help transform contaminated properties and create jobs in overburdened communities, while repurposing these sites for a wide range of uses, including public parks, retail businesses, office space, homes and solar power generation, EPA said.\nBesides the Atlanta and Tampa projects, money also will go to a groundwater contamination site in Indianapolis, a former tannery in Danvers, Massachusetts, and a former metal stamping and tool and die shop near St. Louis.\nIn all,\u00a0new projects in 14 states and Puerto Rico will receive funding,\u00a0EPA said.\nAbout $50 million will go to clean up lead contamination in a residential neighborhood in Atlanta.\u00a0The Westside project has been waiting for years to access federal funds.\u00a0Experts say it's unclear exactly where the lead came from, but it is likely from metal foundries that were once common on Atlanta's Westside.\nThe cleanup money 'couldn't come soon enough,' Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., said on a conference call Friday with Regan and other officials. 'This accelerated timeline would not be possible without this historic investment.'\nSimilarly, a project in Tampa was identified as a Superfund site in 1999 but remains contaminated, said Rep. Kathy Castor, D-Fla.\nThe site is near where she and her husband got married, Castor said. In an apparent nod to Warnock's status as a pastor, Castor said that while 'it's important to have faith, there's nothing like having resources\u2033 to clean up pollution.\nRELATED NEWS:",

    "excerpt": "Recent upgrades lead to testing results that show customers in Atlanta have the best experience on Verizon's networkATLANTA, March 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Customers and visitors to Atlanta, GA\u2026",
    "summary": "Recent upgrades lead to testing results that show customers in Atlanta have the best experience on Verizon's network\nATLANTA, March 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Customers and visitors to Atlanta, GA have the best experience when using the Verizon network, according to the nation's most rigorous scientific testing company RootMetrics\u00ae. In the most recent test measuring performance of major wireless carriers throughout Atlanta, Verizon not only wins for overall network performance, but is unbeaten in categories including accessibility, reliability and performance in texts and calls. Today's results show remarkable speeds for Verizon customers in Atlanta with Verizon's median download speed increasing 113% in the market and Verizon's median upload speeds increasing by 37% since last year*.\n'Our network engineers work tirelessly to ensure we can provide the most reliable connections across Atlanta. We will continue to unlock the power of 5G for our customers with better connectivity for their phones, homes and businesses, as part of our ongoing commitment to this community,' said Eric Lia, Vice President of Engineering and Operations for Verizon.\nNetwork enhancements in Atlanta\nThese top marks are a result of months of deploying new enhancements in the network for those who live in and visit the Atlanta area. Currently 79% of people in Atlanta are covered with 5G Ultra Wideband service. That coverage has been expanded recently with the addition of six new macro cell sites and 18 new small cell sites. These new macro cell sites are providing additional coverage and capacity in Powder Springs, Marietta, and Austell, as well as west of Atlanta, in the west of Covington and in the south of Peachtree City. Additional small cells are providing capacity and coverage around the Truist Park and Battery, in Dekalb County, along Cobb Parkway adjacent to Cumberland Mall, in Roswell and in Hiram.\nAtlanta's exceptional 5G coverage uses a combination of mmWave spectrum and Verizon's recently acquired C-band spectrum. Atlanta was among the first to use a full 100 MHz of C-band spectrum almost doubling the spectrum available for 5G Ultra Wideband in many parts of the country. That additional spectrum will turbo charge the service, offering significantly higher speeds, much greater capacity to accommodate more customers and more robust services.\nLastly, the addition of 5G service and the many additional wireless solutions allow far more data to travel on the wireless network in Atlanta. That exponential increase in data carried into and out of the cell sites serving the community requires upgraded fiber optic cable links. Fiber optic cables are used to move data between cell sites and connect those sites to the rest of the network. Verizon has increased the capacity on the fiber connections in many cell sites in the Atlanta area so they can carry 10 times the amount of data.\nServices from the network customers rely on\nFor customers in Atlanta, the additional coverage and capacity means more customers now have access not only to reliable, fast mobile service, but also Verizon Home Internet service, a different kind of home internet with no data caps. It's ideal for anyone who wants super fast connectivity to stream, game or even work remotely. Verizon Home Internet is reliable and fast enough to power home connected devices: smart TVs, tablets, phones, gaming consoles and more. Plans start at just $25 per month with AutoPay and a select 5G mobile plan \u2013 all without extra fees, equipment charges, annual contracts or data caps.** Go to verizon.com/home for availability. Visit verizon.com/deals For the latest 5G phones and accessories.\nAdditionally, through Verizon Frontline, the advanced network and technology developed over three decades of partnership with first responders to meet their unique and evolving needs, public safety agencies in the Atlanta area will also be able to experience the benefits of these network enhancements. To learn more about Verizon Frontline, visit verizon.com/frontline.\nAtlanta area businesses have access to 5G Business Internet from Verizon. 5G Business Internet is ultra-fast wireless business internet powered by 5G Ultra Wideband. This wireless alternative to cable internet is for businesses of all sizes and includes self-setup or professional installation options, multiple pricing and service options, unlimited data, and a 10-year price guarantee for 5G Business Internet service.

    "summary": "Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) condemned antisemitic flyers found on residents' driveways in Atlanta, Ga. suburbs over the weekend.\nResidents of the Sandy Springs and Dunwoody neighborhoods, which are predominantly Jewish, found antisemitic flyers encased in plastic ziploc baggies on their driveways Sunday morning.\n'This kind of hate has no place in our state and the individuals responsible do not share Georgia's values,' Kemp wrote in a tweet on Sunday.\nThe governor added that state law enforcement is ready to assist the local police departments with their investigations into the matter.\nBoth the Dunwoody and Sandy Springs police departments have said they are investigating the incidents, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.\n'We will always condemn acts of antisemitism,' Kemp concluded in his statement.\nKemp was among a number of local officials and lawmakers who denounced the antisemitic act.\n'Please be kind to each other and speak up for each other. I want to personally thank the neighbor who picked them up on my street \u2013 so if you know who it is please let me know,' former state Rep. Mike Wilensky (D), who lives in Dunwoody, said in a Facebook post.\nThe Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism told the Journal-Constitution that the fliers were being distributed by antisemitic groups Goyim Defense League (GDL) and White Lives Matter, which it describes as racist networks focused on espousing hate in the Jewish community.\n'Welcome to being a Jew in Georgia-my driveway this morning,' wrote state Rep. Esther Panitch (D) on Twitter, along with photos of the flyers, which she said Sandy Springs police had taken for testing.\n'Govern yourselves accordingly, GDL and Anti-Semites who seek to harm/intimidate Jews in Georgia. I'm coming for you with the weight of the State behind me,' she added.\nThe Atlanta metro area has seen a rapid rise in reported antisemitic incidents in the past year, the Journal reported.\nIn response to the rise of antisemitic incidents, state lawmakers introduced legislation last month that would provide an official state definition of antisemitism and require state agencies 'to consider such definition when determining whether an alleged act was motivated by discriminatory antisemitic intent.'\nDunwoody Mayor Lynn Deutsch said in a statement. Sunday that 'hateful, divisive, and anti-Semitic rhetoric' has no place in the community.\n'We live, work, serve and play together,' she added. 'At our Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Service, Jews, Christians, and Muslims worked together planting daffodils in memory of those who perished in the Holocaust.'\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. \u2014 Joey Logano slipped past leader Brad Keselowski on the final lap and won Sunday's NASCAR Cup Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\nAlthough Chevrolet drivers won the season's first four races, Fords and Toyotas were in the mix for the win in the closing laps Sunday.\nKeselowski, seeking to end a 65-race winless streak, held the lead at the white flag, but Logano, helped by a push from Christopher Bell, ran past Keselowski on the outside and took the lead for good. Following in the top five were Bell, Corey LaJoie (his best career finish) and Tyler Reddick.\n'This is so special to win at Atlanta for me,' said Logano, who grew up racing Legends cars on the track's quarter-mile loop. 'I have so many memories of me and my dad racing Legends cars here. This is full circle for me. This thing was an animal \u2014 very, very fast.'\nThe win was the 32nd of Logano's career but his first at AMS.\nLeader Aric Almirola, running on older tires, lost control with 52 laps remaining when a tire exploded. He was hit by second-place Kyle Larson.\u00a0 Both cars suffered major damage, and Almirola and Larson left the race.\nWith 71 laps remaining, a multi-car crash began when leader Kevin Harvick lost control as Ross Chastain approached his rear bumper. As Harvick spun out of control, cars scrambled in the middle of the lead drafting pack. Chris Buescher\u2018s car spun and hit the inside wall. Chastain inherited the lead.\nAustin Cindric finished first at the end of Stage 2. Reddick, Logano, Alex Bowman and William Byron followed Cindric to the finish line. Through two stages, Logano had led 135 laps. No other driver had led more than seven.\nLogano, the pole winner, was the boss in the first stage, leading all 60 laps to score his first stage win of the season. He was followed by Cindric, Keselowski, Ryan Blaney and Denny Hamlin.\nThe race's first caution flew only 11 laps into the race as Bubba Wallace hit the inside wall. After repairs, he returned to the race two laps down and in last place. He later lost another lap.\nStage 1 winner: Joey Logano\nStage 2 winner: Austin Cindric\nWho had a good race: Joey Logano was clearly the dominant car over the first two stages and made a fine move on the last lap to win. \u2026 Brad Keselowski ran at or near the front all day and put himself in position to win over the final laps, finishing second. \u2026 Corey LaJoie ran well in the final stage and finished fourth.\nWho had a bad race: Bubba Wallace brought out the race's first caution on Lap 11, losing control of his car and slamming the inside wall. He lost two laps. \u2026 William Byron came into the race with two consecutive wins but was among the drivers sidelined by a multi0car crash with 71 laps left. \u2026 Chris Buescher raced with the leaders but parked with heavy damage during the race's fourth caution. \u2026 Aric Almirola's team gambled with tire strategy, taking the lead in the final stage but eventually failing as Almirola whacked the wall and left the race.\nNext: The Cup Series rolls on to Circuit of the Americas in Austin, Texas for a March 26 race (3:30 p.m. ET, Fox).\nDr. Diandra: Atlanta a chance for Trackhouse to regain momentum Atlanta Xfinity race results Austin Hill wins Atlanta Xfinity race\nJoey Logano wins NASCAR Cup Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway originally appeared on NBCSports.com",

    "summary": "LAKE BURTON, GA / ACCESSWIRE / February 15, 2023 / One attribute that separates BCG from other Lake Burton/Lake Martin slate roofing contractors is that they are one of very few installers of Brava Roof Tile that is certified. Additionally, BCG has recently been awarded \u2018Brava Preferred Contractor' making this the first roofing company recognized for this honor in the state of Georgia. Once named as a \u2018Brava Preferred Contractor', the provider is considered among the best in the industry known for their experience and commitment to quality roofing.\nMore information about Brava products can be found on the company website via: https://www.braswellconstructiongroup.com/brava-roofing\nBraswell Construction Group also offers Davinci Slate and is recognized as a DaVinci Masterpiece Contractor by DaVinci Roofscapes. The program, sponsored by DaVinci RoofScapes, was established to facilitate relations with select contractors in recognition of their expertise and experience in installing and maintaining DaVinci synthetic slate and shake roofing systems. This esteemed accolade and elite status of being named a DaVinci Masterpiece Contractor recognizes a heightened level of expertise and experience in installing DaVinci roofing systems. BCG has also been awarded 'project of the year winner' in both 2019 and 2021 for a stunning Gainesville, GA and Greensboro GA slate roof installation.\nKnown for their exceptional reputation in the world of roofing materials, DaVinci offers a long list of products that were created with homeowners in mind. \"We are proud to work with a manufacturer that is so focused on the needs of homeowners,\" says Chris Braswell, CEO of Braswell Construction Group. DaVinci is committed to quality and the various aesthetic needs of its customers. They go above and beyond to provide tiles that last. Their Slate line is made to bring the beauty of a natural slate roof without any of the problems that come with traditional options.\nAt first glance, homeowners will notice the superior quality difference of the Slate line. It is created to be both versatile and commanding by bringing together an exceptional look and fit. While natural slate is more prone to physical damage, the DaVinci synthetic Slate line was made to be resilient. Natural slate can often end up with tiny fissures caused by exposure to weather like rain and hail, or from the freezing and thawing cycle that can occur throughout the seasons.\nTo round out the line-up of premium slate offerings, is EcoStar Slate. EcoStar was established to meet the need for a recycled synthetic alternative to natural slate roofing which led to the manufacture of their first line of synthetic product - Majestic Slate. For more than 25 years, they have been dedicated to protecting precious natural resources by offering their discerning customers products made with recycled plastic and rubber. EcoStar tiles are manufactured with a material made of up to 80% recycled post-industrial rubber and plastic.\nBCG offers premium slate roofing options for customers wanting to improve the look and function of their home. The expanding category of synthetic roofing products cater to homeowners, builders, and remodelers who prefer renewable resources that come with the advantage of extreme durability and longevity yet want the look of natural slate roofs. Braswell Construction Group explains that synthetic slate roofing is a mixture of recycled rubber and plastic put into molds that are taken from real slate roofing. As contrasted to real slate roofing, this is less costly, lighter, and is much more resilient and durable because it can be installed without the concern of damaging the product. And just like the real slate, its life expectancy can also last a hundred years.\nAdvanced materials and manufacturing technologies give the synthetic products better resistance to weathering, greater durability, and longer lifespans than real slate, according to manufacturers. \"The material is mimicked to obtain efficiency and also longer life over the natural product,\" says Chris Braswell, owner of BCG. \"We offer the best roofing materials with these three synthetic slate lines because they perfectly resemble the natural beauty of slate roof shingles, but without the drawbacks and upkeep.\"\nAbout Braswell Construction Group:\nBraswell Construction Group is a leader in specialty synthetic slate roofing, has been locally owned and operated since 2002, and prides itself on its high-quality craftsmanship, exceptional customer service, and professional acumen. They have a reputation for always completing its roofing and restoration projects on time and on budget while providing customized service, top-notch customer service, and unparalleled workmanship.\nBraswell Construction Group has been featured dozens of times in Yahoo Finance, ABC, FOX, CBS, Atlanta Leader among many others as an industry leader and the top Roofing Contractor in the state of Georgia.\nBraswell Construction Group operates from four Georgia locations to service homeowners with all their roofing and restoration needs in Lake Burton, Lake Martin, Atlanta, Augusta, Athens, Greensboro/Lake Oconee, Covington/Conyers, Stone Mountain, and their respective surrounding areas.\nFor more information, please visit https://www.braswellconstructiongroup.com\nContact Info:Name: Michelle BirdEmail: info@braswellconstructiongroup.comOrganization: Braswell Construction Group, Inc.

It was planned for weeks and announced on social media. Antifa are self proclaimed communists and consistently organize to attack our government over and over again. They should be taken seriously and not tolerated anymore,' she tweeted.\nIn January, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) issued a state of emergency after peaceful protests broke out in response to a police shooting of an activist during an operation to clear out the construction site for the facility.\nGreene's resolution would not be the first of its kind. Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.) introduced a resolution in 2021 to designate Antifa as a terrorist organization, but the resolution did not get any traction in the Democrat-controlled House.",

(AP) \u2014 A frustrated Josh Williams made a dramatic exit in the caution-marred first stage of NASCAR's Xfinity Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway on Saturday, leaving his car parked on the start-finish line for dramatic effect.\nFour cautions covered 26 of 40 laps in the first stage, including a final yellow after debris came off Williams' No. 92 Chevrolet and he was ordered to park his vehicle.\nA frustrated Williams followed instructions, but on his terms. He parked his car on the checkered start-finish line, climbed out and walked toward his pit crew with a wave to the fans, apparently delivered with sarcasm.\nBefore exiting his car, Williams angrily complained to his crew on his radio it was 'apparently' NASCAR regulations to park your vehicle following a wreck 'of any kind.' Added Williams: 'This is some bull you know what. I've never heard of this in my life.'\nWilliams was taken to the infield care center and then escorted to his team hauler without speaking to reporters.\nIt was an ominous start to a day filled with cautions in the Atlanta doubleheader of truck and Xfinity races. There were a race-record 11 cautions in Christian Eckes' second career truck series win earlier Saturday.\nThe first caution in the Xfinity race came out on only the second lap following a collision between Ceasar Vacarella and Joev Gase. The second caution followed only 10 laps later.\n___\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

The Nets lead the regular-season series 2-0.\nIn the first matchup, a Nets 120-116 win on Dec. 9, Kevin Durant scored 34 points to lead Brooklyn in scoring while Kyrie Irving had 33 points. The Nets winning this game gave them a 6-1 record through their 7-game homestand and their ninth win in 12 games.\nIn the second game, a Brooklyn 108-107 win on Dec. 28, Kyrie Irving scored 28 points, including 15 points in the fourth quarter, to lead the Nets to their 10th win in a row. At the time, the 10-game winning streak was the longest in the NBA and with the victory, Brooklyn had won its 14th games out of 15.\nBrooklyn comes into this game off a disappointing 131-87 loss to the Chicago Bulls on Friday. It looked like the Nets never made it out of the locker room as the Bulls scored the game's first 11 points and never looked back. Brooklyn is still trying to build chemistry at a critical part of the season while dealing with the fact that guard Ben Simmons may not be healthy again for the rest of this season.\nAtlanta comes into this game amidst some changes as well. Along with the front office structure, the Hawks fired coach Nate McMillan during the All-Star break because of how the team has underperformed this season. Despite all of the changes, Atlanta was able to beat the Cleveland Cavaliers on Friday 136-119.\nHere's when and where you can tune in to see the matchup:\nHow to watch\nDate: Sunday, Feb. 26\nTime: 3 p.m. EST\nLocation: State Farm Arena, Atlanta, GA\nChannel: YES Network\nNets at Hawks notable injuries\nNets: OUT: Ben Simmons (knee).\nHawks: QUESTIONABLE: John Collins (back).\nProbable starting lineups\n\nGuard: Spencer Dinwiddie\nGuard: Mikal Bridges\nForward: Cameron Johnson\nForward: Dorian Finney-Smith\nCenter: Nic Claxton\nAtlanta Hawks\nGuard: Trae Young\nGuard: Dejounte Murray\nForward: De'Andre Hunter\nForward: John Collins\nCenter: Clint Capela",

Events will be held monthly throughout the city through June.\nAn increasing number of children in Georgia do not have consistent access to enough food, 1 in 7 children in Georgia are food insecure. This can have long-term effects on their health and future. Children who are food insecure are more likely to struggle in school, and to have growth and developmental issues. Atlanta-based Americold and Feed the Children are working together with the Mayor's Office of International and Immigrant Affairs - Welcoming Atlanta to deliver hope through four community resource events that will provide access to food, essential items, books and additional resources.\nAmericold and Feed the Children hope to help bring awareness to the need for additional resources in the community as many Atlanta residents reside in food deserts and have difficulty accessing enough food to support their families. Georgia has one of the highest shares of low-income areas whose residents also lack adequate access to supermarkets.\nAt each event families will receive a 25-pound box of food and a 15-pound box of essentials including soaps and self-care items, and a 5-pound action box that includes fun and healthy activities for children. Community partners including Atlanta Public Schools, CORE, Department of Parks and Recreation, Children's Museum Atlanta, and the Atlanta-Fulton Public Library will be on-site to share information on additional support services and programs that are available for children and their families.\nThe partnership will also directly support Atlanta Public Schools, providing over 20 schools throughout the district, each school will receive items to help stock resource rooms where students will have access to food and essentials. With schools closing soon for spring break the need for accessible food increases. Thousands of students in Atlanta rely on free or reduced lunches and families must make impossible choices between buying food and paying utility bills or other necessary costs like transportation and childcare when this resource is not available.\nAmericold has a passion for defeating hunger, they recently partnered with Feed the Children to distribute 8,000 ready-to-eat meal kits to students throughout the month of December 2022 to help support students with access to food during the holiday when families struggle to provide enough food without free, or reduced cost meals available while schools are closed winter break. These meals were distributed at Community Resource events across Atlanta neighborhoods including Adamsville, Morningside, Lindbergh, Orchard Knob, Lenox, Virginia Highlands, Perkerson, Bolton and Underwood Hills.\nAmericold plays an integral role in the food supply chain, owning and operating 250 temperature-controlled warehouses around the world, with approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet of storage. Its facilities connect food producers, processors, distributors and retailers to consumers, ensuring that food is preserved and protected on its journey from farm to fork.\n\"Our partnership with Feed the Children is incredibly meaningful because it is one way that we show our commitment to fighting hunger and to giving back in the communities where we live and work. We're especially proud of these events in Atlanta because our company headquarters are here. We also own and operate a dozen cold storage facilities in the area to deliver on our mission to help our customers feed the world,\" said George Chappelle, CEO of Americold.\nDuring the five-year partnership, Americold has donated critical funds to Feed the Children as well as travelled hundreds of thousands of miles providing complimentary temperature-controlled transportation services of chilled and frozen goods. Together, the organizations have helped feed hundreds of thousands of families across America.\nFeed the Children believes it takes everyone - the nonprofit sector, corporations, community organizations, government officials and food suppliers - to come together to do good for those who need it. When efforts are combined, a greater impact is achieved.\n\"Children cannot thrive unless their basic needs are met,\" said Travis Arnold, president and CEO of Feed the Children. \"A widespread issue like childhood hunger will only be solved when enough people work together. Partners like Americold are vital to our mission as we serve vulnerable communities in cities across the United States.\"\nAbout Americold\nAmericold is the world's largest publicly traded REIT focused on the ownership, operation, acquisitions and development of temperature-controlled warehouses. Based in Atlanta, Georgia, Americold owns and operates 250 temperature-controlled warehouses, with approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet of storage, in North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, and South America.

    "summary": "FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 At the start of his first week at the Atlanta Falcons practice facility, new defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen said he's not willing to commit to a 4-3 or 3-4 as the base alignment of his multiple schemes.\n'Let's just stop people,' Nielsen said Monday.\nNielsen, the former co-defensive coordinator for the New Orleans Saints, was hired by Atlanta on Jan. 27 to replace Dean Pees, who retired at 73.\nNielsen, 43, takes over a unit which ranked 27th in total defense, allowing 362.1 yards per game. Atlanta ranked 31st with 21 sacks.\nAtlanta's defense gained momentum in Pees' second and final season, allowing no more than 25 points in the final nine games of a 7-10 season and under 20 points in five of the last six games.\nNielsen said he wants to build on Pees' work, not start over.\n'Dean has done a great job here,' Nielsen said. 'We don't want to just blow everything up and start all over again. We're going to take what we've done well here the last couple of years and implement some new things, put in some new ideas and just kind of marry it.'\nA chronic weak spot on defense has been the pass rush. Atlanta ranked 31st with 21 sacks after finishing last in 2021.\nNielsen, who also coached the Saints defensive line, has had success in helping to devise successful pass rushes. He joined the Saints staff in 2017, and New Orleans finished in the top 10 in sacks in five of his six seasons.\nThe search for an edge rusher could rank near the top of the Falcons' needs during free agency and the draft.\n'We'll get it going,' said Nielsen when asked about the pass rush.\nNielsen joined coach Arthur Smith, general manager Terry Fontenot and the coaching staff at the East-West Shrine Bowl in Las Vegas last week. Fontenot worked 18 years with the Saints before he was hired by Atlanta in 2021.\n'Obviously, Terry and I have a relationship in the past, so that part was easy,' Nielsen said, adding the leadership with Falcons owner Arthur Blank, Fontenot and Smith was important in his decision to leave New Orleans.\n'It's the right fit,' Nielsen said. 'Ownership, head coach, general manager who see a lot of things the same. The way this program is going, the organization and how guys play. Definitely the right fit and the place I want to be.'\nNielsen said there's no need to classify his defense as a four-man or three-man front because it will employ principles of each scheme.\n'You guys can call it whatever you want to call it,' he said.\n'We're going to be multiple in what we do and it may look 3-4 but it also may look 4-3,' Nielsen said.\nWhen announcing Nielsen's hire, the Falcons said three defensive assistants will not return next season: defensive line coach Gary Emanuel, outside linebackers coach Ted Monachino and secondary coach Jon Hoke.\nSmith hired former Green Bay defensive backs coach Jerry Gray as assistant head coach for defense last week.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL",

    "summary": "Feb. 17\u2014U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, D-Ga., has submitted his formal opposition to a proposed strip mine near the Okefenokee National Wildlife Refuge.\nIn a letter to Richard Dunn, director of the Georgia Environmental Protection Division, Ossoff urged that the application submitted by Alabama-based Twin Pines Minerals be rejected.\nOssoff citied studies by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service and a leading hydrologist at the University of Georgia, saying they \"produced clear and convincing evidence\" the mining plan does not meet the standards necessary to get a mining permit.\nHe cited hydrologic models in the mining plan that \"are incapable of appropriately evaluating the impacts of the project on water levels in the Okefenokee Swamp\" and fail to consider seasonal and annual hydrologic variations that will affect mining operations.\nHe said the analysis \"calls directly into question\" Twin Pines' statement that \"proposed mining activities will have an insignificant impact [on] the groundwater and stream flow to the Okefenokee Swamp.\"\nAnother concern is the effects of salt deposits downwind of the evaporation system for the water that will be pumped out of the 50-foot deep pit so heavy minerals can be separated from the sand. He said there is the need for a contingency plan for unplanned discharges to the local tributaries to the St. Marys River.\nThe proposed reclamation activities from mining will result in a loss of wetland areas and reduced the reclaimed area's ability to maintain wetland properties, reducing the available habitat for wetland species, he said.\n\"These conclusions underscore that the mining plan does not meet the standard outlined in EPD's notice,\" Ossoff said.\nHe questioned Twin Pines' claims that \"the water table around the moving mine pit will quickly recover close to its original position and that mining activities will not de-water the Okefenokee Swamp.\"\nOssoff said the Fish & Wildlife Service's study showed \"mining activities would disrupt the Trail Ridge soil profile and result in seasonally lower mean water table levels.\"\nTrail Ridge is a coastal terrace that forms the eastern boundary of the Okefenokee and is believed to help keep the water in the swamp.\nAnother study by the University of Georgia concludes groundwater withdrawals from the mining pit \"will triple the frequency of severe drought in the southeast portion of the swamp and the upper St. Marys River.\"\nThe frequency and intensity of wildfires will increase and the extended drought conditions could lead to \"permanent changes\" to the Okefenokee's ecosystem and \"significant economic detriment for our state.\"\nHe described the Okefenokee as a \"unique and irreplaceable natural resource.\"\nDamage to the swamp will \"irrevocably harm\" the Okefenokee, the state of Georgia and the state's tourism industry, he said. An estimated 600,000 people visit the Okefenokee every year, creating more than 750 local jobs and more than $64 million to local economies.\n\"With great respect, I submit to you that the risk of severe damage to this ecosystem is unacceptable,\" Ossoff concluded in his letter. \"I therefore urge EPD to reject Twin Pines' application.\"\nThe public comment period is open until March 20.

    "summary": "As police officers responded to a gas station shooting in Georgia, they heard more shots fired at a second gas station and raced over there, federal officials said.\nA witness told police the gunshots were fired from a car that drove away, leading one officer to pull over its driver soon after in Jonesboro on July 30, 2021, according to court documents.\nThe driver, Larry Edward Foxworth, 48, of Jonesboro, told police he shot at both gas stations because he was hoping to kill Arab and Black people he believed were inside, prosecutors said.\nAfter he was arrested, he boasted about 'having struck a blow for white supremacy' and excitedly asked officers if anyone had died in the attack, court documents say. Ultimately, no one was hurt or hit in the shooting, according to prosecutors.\nNow, a judge has sentenced Foxworth to 20 years in prison after he pleaded guilty to committing a hate crime based on actual or perceived race or color, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Georgia announced in a March 16 news release.\n'That this crime did not become yet another notorious massacre is no credit to (Foxworth),' his sentencing memo says. 'He tried, sincerely, to perpetrate murder on a mass scale. Nothing but sheer luck stopped his shots from finding their intended targets.'\nMcClatchy News contacted Foxworth's attorney for comment on March 17 and didn't immediately receive a response.\nAhead of Foxworth's sentencing, prosecutors emphasized the need for a lengthy prison sentence and described him as 'unquestionably a brutal and dangerous person,' according to the sentencing memo.\nThe case dates to July 30, 2021, when Foxworth used a Glock pistol and repeatedly fired at one Jonesboro gas station and convenience store before doing the same at another location minutes later, prosecutors said.\nAt both gas stations, his bullets struck through the windows and doors of the convenience stores, according to officials.\nOne of the store's cashiers who survived the shooting quit afterward, prosecutors said. The event caused her extreme anxiety for months.\nFoxworth had a prior criminal history including convictions related to assaults, prosecutors said.\n'Hate-fueled violence not only traumatizes the victims, but it threatens and intimidates an entire community,' Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said in a statement. 'This sentence demonstrates the importance of holding accountable those who commit racially-motivated violence.'\nJonesboro is about 15 miles south of downtown Atlanta.\nMom working for DOJ exposes son's \u2018snitches' after he's accused of robbery, feds say\n\n\u2018Aryan Circle' prison gang had suspected gay inmate beaten as rite of passage, feds say",

(AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Falcons found their new defensive coordinator from an NFC South rival's coaching staff on Friday by hiring Ryan Nielsen, the former New Orleans Saints co-defensive coordinator.\nNielsen replaces Dean Pees, 73, who retired on Jan. 9 following two seasons in charge of the defense on coach Arthur Smith's staff.\nThe Falcons also announced three defensive assistants will not return next season: defensive line coach Gary Emanuel, outside linebackers coach Ted Monachino and secondary coach Jon Hoke.\nNielsen will be reunited with Falcons general manager Terry Fontenot, who worked 18 years with the Saints before he was hired by Atlanta in 2021.\nNielsen, 43, interviewed with the Falcons on Tuesday. He had worked on the Saints' staff since 2017 and was the defensive line coach this season.\nNielsen's success with the Saints' pass rush may have impressed Fontenot. The Falcons ranked 31st with only 21 sacks this season after having the league's fewest sacks in 2021. Atlanta ranked 27th in total defense, allowing 362.1 yards per game while finishing 7-10.\nThe Saints have recorded 282 sacks since Nielsen joined the staff in 2017, the second-most in the league during that span. New Orleans finished in the top 10 in sacks in five of the six seasons. The Saints finished in the top four in rushing defense in four of the last five years.\nIn Nielsen's six seasons working with the Saints' defensive line, Cameron Jordan became the first New Orleans defensive lineman to be named a first-team All-Pro. Jordan also earned two second-team All-Pro honors and was named to five Pro Bowls.\nNielson was a defensive assistant and recruiting coordinator at North Carolina State from 2013-16. He also coached at Northern Illinois, Tennessee-Martin, Central Connecticut State, Mississippi, Idaho and Southern California.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nThe Associated Press",

    "summary": "Cashiers NC Slate Roofing Company, Braswell Construction Group, transforms homes with elegant Brava, DaVinci, and EcoStar Slate Roofing Systems.\nCASHIERS, NC / ACCESSWIRE / March 24, 2023 / One attribute that separates BCG from other slate roofing contractors is that they are one of very few installers of Brava Roof Tile that is certified. Additionally, BCG has recently been awarded \u2018Brava Preferred Contractor' making this the first roofing company recognized for this honor in the state of Georgia. Once named as a \u2018Brava Preferred Contractor', the provider is considered among the best in the industry known for their experience and commitment to quality roofing.\nMore information about Brava products can be found on the company website via: https://www.braswellconstructiongroup.com/brava-roofing\nBraswell Construction Group also offers Davinci Slate and is recognized as a DaVinci Masterpiece Contractor by DaVinci Roofscapes. The program, sponsored by DaVinci RoofScapes, was established to facilitate relations with select contractors in recognition of their expertise and experience in installing and maintaining DaVinci synthetic slate and shake roofing systems. This esteemed accolade and elite status of being named a DaVinci Masterpiece Contractor recognizes a heightened level of expertise and experience in installing DaVinci roofing systems. BCG has also been awarded 'project of the year winner' in both 2019 and 2021 for a stunning Gainesville, GA and Greensboro GA slate roof installation.\nKnown for their exceptional reputation in the world of roofing materials, DaVinci offers a long list of products that were created with homeowners in mind. \"We are proud to work with a manufacturer that is so focused on the needs of homeowners,\" says Chris Braswell, CEO of Braswell Construction Group. DaVinci is committed to quality and the various aesthetic needs of its customers. They go above and beyond to provide tiles that last. Their Slate line is made to bring the beauty of a natural slate roof without any of the problems that come with traditional options.\nAt first glance, homeowners will notice the superior quality difference of the Slate line. It is created to be both versatile and commanding by bringing together an exceptional look and fit. While natural slate is more prone to physical damage, the DaVinci synthetic Slate line was made to be resilient. Natural slate can often end up with tiny fissures caused by exposure to weather like rain and hail, or from the freezing and thawing cycle that can occur throughout the seasons.\nTo round out the line-up of premium slate offerings, is EcoStar Slate. EcoStar was established to meet the need for a recycled synthetic alternative to natural slate roofing which led to the manufacture of their first line of synthetic product - Majestic Slate. For more than 25 years, they have been dedicated to protecting precious natural resources by offering their discerning customers products made with recycled plastic and rubber. EcoStar tiles are manufactured with a material made of up to 80% recycled post-industrial rubber and plastic.\nBCG offers premium slate roofing options for customers wanting to improve the look and function of their home. The expanding category of synthetic roofing products cater to homeowners, builders, and remodelers who prefer renewable resources that come with the advantage of extreme durability and longevity yet want the look of natural slate roofs. Braswell Construction Group explains that synthetic slate roofing is a mixture of recycled rubber and plastic put into molds that are taken from real slate roofing. As contrasted to real slate roofing, this is less costly, lighter, and is much more resilient and durable because it can be installed without the concern of damaging the product. And just like the real slate, its life expectancy can also last a hundred years.\nAdvanced materials and manufacturing technologies give the synthetic products better resistance to weathering, greater durability, and longer lifespans than real slate, according to manufacturers. \"The material is mimicked to obtain efficiency and also longer life over the natural product,\" says Chris Braswell, owner of BCG. \"We offer the best roofing materials with these three synthetic slate lines because they perfectly resemble the natural beauty of slate roof shingles, but without the drawbacks and upkeep.\"\nAbout Braswell Construction Group:\nBraswell Construction Group is a leader in specialty synthetic slate roofing, has been locally owned and operated since 2002, and prides itself on its high-quality craftsmanship, exceptional customer service, and professional acumen. They have a reputation for always completing its roofing and restoration projects on time and on budget while providing customized service, top-notch customer service, and unparalleled workmanship.\nBraswell Construction Group has been featured dozens of times in Yahoo Finance, ABC, FOX, CBS, Atlanta Leader among many others as an industry leader and the top Roofing Contractor in the state of Georgia.\nBraswell Construction Group operates from four Georgia locations to service homeowners with all their roofing and restoration needs in Cashiers/Highlands NC, Lake Burton, Lake Martin, Atlanta, Augusta, Athens, Greensboro/Lake Oconee, Covington/Conyers, Stone Mountain, and their respective surrounding areas.\nFor more information, please visit https://www.braswellconstructiongroup.com\nContact Info:Name: Michelle BirdEmail: info@braswellconstructiongroup.comOrganization: Braswell Construction Group, Inc.

Redfin puts the 9,407-square-foot home's current value at just under $2.5 million, while Zillow estimates it at just over $2.8 million.\nTMZ reported last week that a foreclosure notice had been posted on the house indicating it would go up for auction March 7.\nBut two of the couple's daughters laughed at a TMZ videographer a few days later when quizzed about the situation, with Ariana Biermann saying, \"don't believe everything you read\" and verifying that it was a misunderstanding and that all of their stuff was still in the house.\nThe posting of an auction notice is only one step in the foreclosure process \u2014 which in many cases can be stopped along the way \u2014 and it doesn't always mean that an auction will result.

    "summary": "VIRGINIA BEACH, Va., March 21, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- A five-year pilot from Virginia Natural Gas (VNG) aims to encourage the development of renewable natural gas (RNG) production facilities within the VNG service territory. Recently approved by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, the RNG Interconnect pilot program also authorizes the company to integrate RNG into its natural gas distribution system.\nThe pilot is part of the energy company's Sustainable Gas Program, which will allow for the production and delivery of RNG into VNG's pipeline system and support the procurement of both RNG and Next Generation Natural Gas. This is complementary to VNG's path to reach net-zero direct greenhouse emissions from its operations by 2050.\nVNG is the first local distribution company in the state to establish a Commission-approved tariff that allows an interconnection between an RNG production facility and a natural gas utility's distribution system.\n\"At Virginia Natural Gas, we are committed to supporting the development of renewable energy sources as we pursue our climate and environmental goals,\" said Robert Duvall, president of Virginia Natural Gas. \"The approval of this pilot program is a significant step as we move forward to develop sustainable, environmentally responsible solutions while helping our state lead in the progress toward a clean energy future.\"\nAs part of the approval, Virginia Natural Gas will be able to interconnect RNG production facilities with its existing natural gas pipeline distribution system to encourage the production and delivery of a resilient, alternative source of natural gas while providing additional benefits for the distribution system, customers and local economies.\nRNG is a low or negative carbon energy solution that is derived from organic waste including farm, municipal, landfill and industrial waste. As these organic waste sources decompose, methane is produced, which is captured and converted to RNG. It is a sustainable and reliable energy source that is compatible with existing infrastructure when blended with natural gas. RNG can be integrated into the VNG distribution system, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and can be used directly in a manner consistent with traditional natural gas for residential, commercial, industrial and transportation purposes.\nAlong with VNG's efforts to support sustainable gas supply opportunities like RNG, other emission reduction efforts at VNG include innovative technologies, such as the use of artificial intelligence to predict third-party damages to critical infrastructure.\nAdditionally, VNG is reducing emissions through the Steps to Advance Virginia's Energy (SAVE) program by renewing its natural gas infrastructure, replacing aging pipes with new, more durable materials that reduce methane emissions, continue the safe delivery of natural gas, and are less expensive to maintain. Since the program began in 2012, VNG has replaced more than 500 miles of aging pipeline, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 31%.\nThe energy company is also utilizing innovative cross-compression technologies to capture natural gas removed during maintenance activities and reinsert it back into the pipeline system for continued use. This results in less gas or methane entering the atmosphere.\nLearn more information about VNG's sustainable program.\nAbout Virginia Natural Gas\u00a0Virginia Natural Gas is one of four natural gas distribution companies of Southern Company Gas, a wholly owned subsidiary of Southern Company (NYSE: SO). Virginia Natural Gas provides clean, safe, reliable and affordable natural gas service to more than 300,000 residential, commercial and industrial customers in southeast Virginia.

Arrest warrants for the suspect describe a pattern of late-night and early-morning burglaries where the suspect used techniques reminiscent of a heist movie.\nMajor's son, Aron Major, Jr., was also arrested on a single count of tampering with evidence the day after his father was arrested.

    "summary": "Vandals in Atlanta hurled bricks and Molotov cocktails at police officers and set cars on fire on Sunday in protest of an 85-acre training complex for the city's police and fire departments.\nIt's the latest in a series of attacks against the facility, which has been dubbed \"Cop City\" by its detractors.\nThe planned $90 million complex has been the ire of environmentalists and anti-police activists since 2021, when the Atlanta City Council approved the complex in June of that year. The facility is primarily being funded by donations to the nonprofit Atlanta Police Foundation and will include an amphitheater, classrooms and training areas for police to carry out simulated crime situations, such as shootouts, the New York Post reported.\nA coalition of left-wing activists soon moved into the woods after the decision was announced, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, in a bid to prevent the construction. Other left-wing activists such as antifa members, criminal justice reform activists and other environmentalists have also become involved in the protests, the New York Times reported last week.\nProtests at \"Cop City\" hit a fever pitch back in January, when a state trooper shot and killed an environmental activist named Manuel Esteban Paez Teran, 26, who reportedly went by the name Tortuguita and identified as non-binary. Teran was shot after allegedly refusing demands from authorities and firing a gun at state troopers.\nATLANTA'S FUTURE POLICE TRAINING FACILITY \u2018COP CITY' SET ABLAZE\n\nA Georgia State Patrol trooper, who was wearing a bulletproof vest, was also shot in the abdomen and left injured.\nRepublican Gov. Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency over the violence that month, authorizing up to 1,000 members of the Georgia National Guard to be called upon for any other potential incidents of violence. The order remained in effect until Feb. 9.\nAt least 19 people had been arrested and charged with domestic terrorism since December to March 5 in connection to protests and riots against the project, including six who were arrested during a riot in Atlanta.\n\nThe planned project has galvanized environmentalists and anti-police protesters to stand together against the project.\u00a0 Anti-cop protesters say the police tactics learned at the facility will not lead to a decrease in crime and have slammed the project as one that promotes the militarization of the police department.\n\"To be clear \u2014 cop city is not just a controversial training center. It is a war base where police will learn military-like maneuvers to kill black people and control our bodies and movements.\" Kwame Olufemi, of Community Movement Builders - a group that advocates for police forces to be defunded and \"eventually\" abolished - states on the site \"Stop Cop City.\"\n\"The facility includes shooting ranges, plans for bomb testing, and will practice tear gas deployment. They are practicing how to make sure poor and working class people stay in line. So when the police kill us in the streets again, like they did to Rayshard Brooks in 2020, they can control our protests and community response to how they continually murder our people,\" Olufemi added.\nEnvironmentalists say the facility will destroy the South River Forest, also called the \"Weelaunee\" by the Muscogee Creek people.\n\n\"The period of planetary climate collapse that we are all living in will continue to pose urgent and unsettling questions to our species as we fight for dignity in a world of increasingly dangerous wildfires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, and mass extinction. Rather than address the problems as they really present themselves, world and local leaders are hurling us into the fire,\" the group \"Defend the Atlanta Forest\" states on its website.\nLast year, vandals targeted the office of a contractor working on the facility, breaking windows at the Birmingham, Alabama, office and scrawling graffiti on the building, Fox 5 reported. The contractor said the incident caused $80,000 in damages.\nTheir demands were clearly written in one graffiti message at the office: \"Drop Cop City or Else.\"\nStop Cop City posted an open letter to its website this year calling for Atlanta to cancel the lease for the planned project. A handful of liberal activist groups signed the letter, including A World Without Police, the Unitarian Universalist Association, NW Yonkers for Black Lives Matter, and the ikiyA collective - which describes itself as a \"group of femme, queer, two-spirit Black, Indigenous, and people of the global majority.\"\nDefend the Atlanta Forest did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. A contact option on Stop Cop City's website only redirects to its open letter, with no apparent contact information on its website.\nThis week, protesters will reportedly carry out a \"week of action\" against the planned facility, with state leaders gearing up to \"hold everybody accountable that is engaged in violent activity,\" according to Georgia Attorney General Chris Carr.\nAt least 35 people were detained for the violence on Sunday, and some of those allegedly involved were from foreign countries. The Atlanta Police Department on Monday released the booking photos of 23 people who were charged with domestic terrorism for the incidents the day prior.\n\"Some of those arrested yesterday were from Massachusetts and New York and France and Canada. So this is a national network, an international group of people that are organized to come to our state to undermine a public safety training center,\" Carr said in an appearance on Fox News Monday morning.\nAtlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said the violence seen on Sunday marked a \"significant escalation\" in violence and the number of suspects involved.\n\"This wasn't about a public safety training center. This was about anarchy, and this was about an attempt to destabilize. And we are addressing that quickly,\" Schierbaum told reporters Sunday. \"Actions such as this will not be tolerated. You attack law enforcement officers, you damage equipment, you are breaking the law. This was a very violent attack that occurred this evening.\"\n\nSchierbaum said he has been clear on what a protest is versus violence, and that \"legitimate protests\" would have the \"the full protection of the Atlanta Police Department.\"\nInstead, Schierbaum said the incidents on Sunday were \"criminal activity.\"\n\"This is not a protest. This is criminal activity. And the charges that will be brought forth will show that,\" he said.\nBoth Schierbaum and Carr have highlighted to the media this week that the majority of suspects detained on Sunday were not from the state of Georgia, let alone Atlanta. Out of the 23 charged, two were from the Peach State.\n\"We have video of all these individuals and we will continue to investigate this case based on all the facts and evidence that we have. And we will hold everybody accountable that is engaged in violent activity. This is not peaceful protest,\" Carr said Monday on Fox News' \"America's Newsroom.\" \"Protesters use words, rioters use violence. And again, in Georgia, you can be charged with domestic terrorism for engaging in this type of behavior.\"\nThe attacks on Sunday spurred Republican Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to announce she will introduce a resolution that would formally designate antifa as a terrorist organization.\n\n\"Antifa are domestic terrorists and I'm introducing my resolution to officially declare them a terrorist organization on Tuesday,\" the congresswoman wrote in a tweet Sunday night.\n\"This is domestic terrorism. It was planned for weeks and announced on social media. Antifa are self proclaimed communists and consistently organize to attack our government over and over again. They should be taken seriously and not tolerated anymore,\" Taylor Greene added.\nIt has not been confirmed by state officials whether members of antifa have taken part in the violence in Atlanta. Fox News Digital reached out to the AG's office but did not immediately receive a reply.\nFox News' Danielle Wallace and Greg Wehner contributed to this report.",

    "summary": "Villano Antillano is bringing her unmatched rap flow to the mainland. On Tuesday, the Puerto Rican rap star announced her first-ever tour dates in the U.S.\nAntillano is set to stop at theaters in cities such as Orlando, Atlanta, and Philadelphia to perform songs from her 2022 album La Sustancia X, which featured songs like 'Kaleidosc\u00f3pica,' 'C\u00e1scara de Coco,' and 'Yo Tengo un Novio.'\n\n\n\n\n'People can expect raw, unfiltered and revolutionary talent throughout the tour. There is a unity that connects queer people across the globe in the face of adversity, how we stand against that is often painfully beautiful and creative; it is art in its purest form,' Antillano tells Rolling Stone in a statement. 'We plan to give spectators a taste of Caribbean Cuir Resistance in all of its might and wondrousness.'\nShe adds, 'We plan to remind people why it is that queer people have always been at the forefront of music, fashion, and couture productions.'\nThe trans rap star was featured in a Rolling Stone profile on the Puerto Rican female artists changing the game for the urbano genre and ending its boys' club.\n'This is an entirely new dynamic, where so many feminine voices are rising. It's a beautifully historic moment,' Antillano told Rolling Stone. 'For a long time, the market \u2014 directed mainly by men \u2014 only had space for one. Being a woman is something so flat to them that just one is enough.'\nAntillano also joins a stacked lineup of artists who are set to perform at Rolling Stone\u2018s Future of Music Showcase. On Wednesday, she'll perform on the same stage as Jay Wheeler, Cuco, iLe, and Dawer x Damper.\nAntillano is also scheduled to perform at several massive tours, including Chile and Argentina's Lollapalooza shows in March, Colombia's Festival Esteero Picnic, and Mexico's Tecate Pa'l Norte and Axe Ceremonia.\nLa Sustancia X Tour 2023\nAug. 18 \u2013 Orlando, FL @ The VanguardAug. 19 \u2013 Atlanta, GA @ Buckhead TheatreAug. 20 \u2013 Charlotte, NC @ UndergroundAug. 24 \u2013 Silver Spring, MD @ Fillmore Silver SpringAug. 25 \u2013 Philadelphia, PA @ Theatre of Living ArtsAug. 27 New Haven, CT @ Toad's Place\nBest of Rolling Stone",

    "summary": "The Rockefeller Foundation grant will benefit entrepreneurs in Miami and Atlanta metro areas\nORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 13, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Economic development nonprofit organization Prospera announced it has received its first grant from The Rockefeller Foundation to provide procurement-focused training and technical assistance to small, Hispanic-owned businesses in the Miami, Fl. and Atlanta, Ga. metro areas. Educational programs funded by the grant will focus on a range of topics related to procurement,\u00a0including minority certifications, bidding processes and resources, and access to capital for small business procurement-related needs. The goal is to help more local entrepreneurs lay a well-built foundation and increase their readiness for contracts with government agencies and corporations.\n\"We are thankful for the opportunity this grant from The Rockefeller Foundation provides for Prospera to help move the needle in helping Hispanic-owned businesses secure contracting opportunities in both the public and private sectors,\" said Prospera President and CEO Augusto Sanabria. \"Our organization's focus has always been on helping entrepreneurs lay a strong foundation and improve their administrative and operational efficiencies, to increase their chances of succeeding and lasting in business. This time, we will focus on helping small business owners establish a strong foundation and infrastructure to pursue, win, and maximize procurement opportunities.\"\nWhile the U.S. government is the largest purchaser of goods and services in the world, only 1.8 percent of federal agencies' total eligible contracting dollars in fiscal year 2020 went to Hispanic-owned small businesses. Increasing the ability of more underserved businesses to access federal spending via procurement contracts aligns with The Rockefeller Foundation's efforts to build assets and economic stability for under-represented, working people.\n\"Miami and Atlanta are among the fastest growing communities for Hispanic entrepreneurial activities in the U.S. The lack of access to procurement-focused resources and financial tools is a huge barrier for these growing businesses to receive opportunities with government and anchor institutions,\" said Gregory Johnson, Managing Director of the Equity & Economic Opportunity Initiative at The Rockefeller Foundation. \"Prospera is helping entrepreneurs overcome the barriers routinely experienced by minority businesses and The Rockefeller Foundation is proud to support this vital work.\"\nAs a complement to education programs, Prospera's in-house staff will also provide individual business consulting sessions and one-on-one support to review individual participant development towards procurement readiness. As clients become ready for procurement, Prospera will work with ecosystem partners in South Florida and Metro Atlanta to provide them with matchmaking opportunities for the necessary exposure to pursue procurement opportunities.\nAbout ProsperaProspera is an economic development, nonprofit organization that has specialized since 1991 in providing bilingual assistance to Hispanic entrepreneurs who want to start, sustain, and grow their business. In the last five years alone, Prospera facilitated over $70 million in loans for small business clients, trained 17,300 entrepreneurs, and helped consulting clients create or retain more than 16,000 jobs. Prospera currently serves Florida, North Carolina, and Georgia.

    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Joey Logano dominated early and then passed Brad Keselowski on the final lap to win NASCAR's race at Atlanta Motor Speedway and end the early season domination of Chevrolet and Hendrick Motorsports on Sunday.\nLogano won the pole and led a strong showing of three straight Team Penske drivers in qualifying, but Keselowski looked like the Ford driver to beat late in the race. Keselowski had help from Corey LaJoie, but Logano got a push from Christopher Bell that proved decisive on the final lap.\nBell finished third in a Toyota and LaJoie finished a career-best fourth in a Chevrolet.\n'The first win of the season always feels better,' said the reigning Cup champion, who led 141 of the 260 laps.\nLogano's win ended a streak of four consecutive victories by Chevrolet to open the NASCAR Cup season, including back-to-back wins by William Byron of Hendrick.\nPushed by his Team Penske teammates Ryan Blaney and Austin Cindric, Logano passed Keselowski to regain the lead with 34 laps to go. Keselowski regained the lead to setup the last-lap drama.\nAfter no cautions during the second stage, the competition \u2014 and crashes \u2014 picked up late in the race.\nKevin Harvick, who won in Atlanta in 2018 and 2020, was leading late when he was lost control while being pushed by Ross Chastain. Replays indicated Chastain's Chevrolet didn't hit Harvick's Ford, but Harvick's spin caused a major crash.\n'I think he was just so close to me he caught me right in the corner,' Harvick said of Chastain. 'The way he came from right to left took the car away from me.'\nByron called the wreck 'just a part of racing.'\nAnother wreck involving the leaders followed 20 laps later when Aric Almirola blew a tire, causing a spin that also took out Kyle Larson and Daniel Suarez.\nHendrick Motorsports' four drivers had fill-in crew chiefs following the largest combined fine on one team in series history for modifying air-deflecting pieces last weekend at Phoenix Raceway. Hendrick was issued a combined $400,000 in fines along with four-race suspensions for the crew chiefs.\nELLIOTT PLANS JULY HOMECOMING\nChase Elliott, the Georgia native who won last summer's race at his home track, continues to recover in Colorado from a broken tibia suffered while snowboarding month.\nElliott posted regrets on his Twitter account for being unable to participate in Sunday's race: 'This is gonna be a tough one today not being in atl for obvious reasons, but I can't wait to see everyone down there in July!'\nWhen Hendrick Motorsports tweeted to Elliott 'Not the same without you here,' Elliott replied with hopes he would return 'hopefully sooner than later my friends.'\nODDS AND ENDS\nAtlanta Motor Speedway announced a multi-year contract extension with Quaker State for its July 9 race. Quaker State also will be the primary sponsor for Daniel Suarez's car in Atlanta's summer race as well as in Richmond on April 2. ... Tyler Reddick started 16th and finished fifth after pre-race concerns he was sick and might not be able to compete in his Toyota. Reddick was excused from the pre-race drivers' meeting. John Hunter Nemechek, who finished eighth in Saturday night's Xfinity race, was available to fill in if Reddick couldn't complete the race.\n\nThe NASCAR Cup series moves to Austin, Texas and the Circuit of the Americas next Sunday. Ross Chastain scored his first career Cup win on the road course last year.\n___\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

    "excerpt": "Robocall Volume Remains in Similar Range of Past Six Months Despite Increased Enforcement IRVINE, Calif., March 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- US consumers received just over 4.3 billion robocalls in\u2026",
    "summary": "Robocall Volume Remains in Similar Range of Past Six Months Despite Increased Enforcement\nIRVINE, Calif., March 3, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- US consumers received just over 4.3 billion robocalls in February, staying within the range of 4.2 billion and 4.7 billion calls per month we have seen since last August. The February volume marked a 4.0% decrease from January's volume.\nFebruary averaged 154.6 million calls/day and 1,790 calls/second, while January averaged 145.5 million calls/day and 1,684 calls/second. This means February actually saw about a 6.3% increase in robocalls on a daily basis, but had fewer robocalls overall because it has 3 fewer days in the month than January.\nOver the past 12 months, Americans have received 51.5 billion robocalls.\n\"Robocall volumes have been very steady for nearly a year,\" said YouMail CEO Alex Quilici. \"Consumers still need to protect themselves with robocall blocking apps like YouMail, since this problem is remarkably stubborn, despite the efforts of enforcement, carriers, and others.\"\nThese latest figures are provided by YouMail, a totally free robocall blocking app and call protection service for mobile phones. The figures are determined by extrapolating from the robocall traffic attempting to get through to YouMail's millions of active users.\nMost Unwanted Robocall in February: Health Insurance Telemarketing\nThe most unwanted robocall campaign for this month is a telemarketing call that appears to be selling low-cost health insurance. The calls leave the identical voicemail message from \"Kelly from Support First,\" as in this example:\nHi, this is Kelly with Support First calling about your free or subsidized Health Insurance. Please call me back toll free at 844-306-0130 to see if you qualify and again that's 844-306-0130. Call now.\nThis call comes from tens of thousands of different numbers, and it appears to be exceeding 50 million calls/month and violating various telemarketing regulations, as well as calling people who did not give prior consent.\nFebruary's Unwanted Call Volume Was Similar to January\nAmericans received roughly 1.9 billion unwanted scam and telemarketing calls in February, roughly the same volume as in January. Notification and payment reminders declined by about 150 million calls during the month, accounting for most of the decline in call volume.\nType of Robocall\nEstimated FebruaryRobocalls\nPercentage February Robocalls\nNotifications\n1.41 billion (-7%)\n33% (flat)\nPayment Reminders\n1.05 billion (-4%)\n24% (flat)\nTelemarketing\n1.22 billion (-2%)\n28% (flat)\nScams\n0.64 billion (-2%)\n15% (flat)\nSome calls initially viewed as telemarketing are eventually recognized as illegal telemarketing or scam calls, so it's important to measure the overall quantity of scam and spam calls combined. A scam call is one that has clearly illegal or fraudulent behavior, such as a call from an enterprise imposter, or one that has a spoofed caller ID. Stir/Shaken continues to reduce the number of robocall campaigns based on spoofed IDs, which drives down the number of obvious scam calls by making them harder to detect, since they appear to be telemarketing campaigns unless there is other evidence of fraud.\n\"Winners\" in February 2023\nThe top cities, area codes, and states with the most robocalls and robocalls/person remained unchanged from January.\nCities with the Most Robocalls:\nAtlanta, GA (171.1 million, -4%)\nDallas, TX (156.9 million, -3%)\nChicago, IL (143.5 million, -6%)\nCities with the Most Robocalls/Person:\nBaton Rouge, LA (42.8/person, -6%)\nMemphis, TN (35.8/person, -9%)\nWashington, DC (31.8/person, -3%)\nArea Codes with the Most Robocalls:\n404 in Atlanta, GA (70.5 million, -5%)\n832 in Houston, TX (61.1 million, -8%)\n678 in Atlanta, GA (57.0 million, -4%)\nArea Codes with the Most Robocalls/Person:\n404 in Atlanta, GA (57.4/person, -5%)\n225 in Baton Rouge, LA (42.4/person, -6%)\n857 in Boston, MA (39.0, -2%)\nState with the Most Robocalls:\nTexas (511.2 million, -4%)\nCalifornia (377.3 million, -5%)\nFlorida (352.4 million, -2%)\nState with the Most Robocalls/Person:\nLouisiana (27.2/person, -6%)\nSouth Carolina (25.5/person, -6%)\nAlabama (23.2/person, -5%)\nThese data points are provided by YouMail, a free call protection app for mobile phones. YouMail won the American Business Awards' Gold Stevie Award for Technical Innovation of the Year, and the YouMail app was named the nation's best robocall-blocking solution in a competition organized by Geoffrey Fowler of the Washington Post.\nYouMail blocks unwanted robocallers by making sure the user's phone doesn't ring, and then plays an out-of-service message that leads them to think they dialed an invalid number. YouMail identifies problematic numbers and robocalls using a combination of its recently patented audio fingerprinting technology, call patterns, and consumer feedback.\nYouMail provides the YouMail Robocall Index to estimate robocall volume across the country and for specific area codes every month. This estimate is formed by extrapolating from the behavior of the billions of calls YouMail has handled for its users, and these statistics are regularly cited by the FCC as a definitive source for national data trends.\nFor a full ranking of cities, states and area codes, as well as details on the behavior of robocallers in each area code, please see http://robocallindex.com.

    "excerpt": "The environmental activist killed by authorities in an Atlanta-area forest last month was shot at least a dozen times, the slain protester's family said Monday while urging officials to release more\u2026",
    "summary": "DECATUR, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The environmental activist killed by authorities in an Atlanta-area forest last month was shot at least a dozen times, the slain protester's family said Monday while urging officials to release more information about the death of the 26-year-old who went by the name Tortuguita.\nThe news conference was held outside a Decatur courthouse just as a large contingent of law enforcement officers accompanied contractors and heavy equipment near the South River Forest about 6 miles (10 kilometers) away, to begin clearing the woods for a planned police and firefighter training center that opponents call 'Cop City,\" news outlets reported.\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said officers killed Tortuguita in self-defense on Jan. 18 after the protester, whose given name was Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n, shot a state trooper while authorities cleared activists from the forested site.\nTortuguita's mother, father and brother, as well as their attorneys, said the GBI has been silent instead of responding to the family's pleas for information about last month's fatal shooting.\nCivil rights attorney Jeff Filipovits said the details offered by authorities so far do not make sense with those who knew Tortuguita to be a 'kind (and) compassionate person,\" \u2014 not a 'domestic terrorist,' a charge that has been filed in recent months against nearly 20 protesters accused of being part of the leftist 'Stop Cop City\" movement.\n'The family needs answers,' Filipovits said. 'So far we've had selective information released by the GBI. They are not answering questions. They are not providing the family with any information to understand what happened in the forest.'\nThe GBI has said no body camera or dashcam footage of the shooting exists, and that ballistics evidence shows that the injured trooper was shot with a bullet from a gun that Tortuguita had legally purchased in 2020.\nFilipovits said the GBI refuses to say whether there was any audio or video recordings from drones, helicopters or other surveillance cameras that could have been in use during the incident.\nFollowing the news conference, the GBI released a statement asking for patience, saying it is 'not releasing any videos currently because agents are continuing to conduct key interviews and want to maintain the integrity of the investigation.'\n'We owe it to the Trooper and (Paez) Teran to complete a thorough investigation,' the GBI said. 'When we began our case, we contacted and spoke with (Paez) Teran's family. We intend to follow up with the family as the investigation progresses.'\nFilipovits' law partner Brian Spears said that Tortuguita's body was released to the family last week and that they had an independent autopsy conducted. They said the autopsy found that Tortuguita was shot 12 or 13 times, perhaps more, from multiple firearms.\nThe protester's body was 'riddled with bullets,' Spears said.\nCity Council approved the $90 million Atlanta Public Safety Training Center in 2021, saying a state-of-the-art campus would replace substandard offerings and boost police morale, which is beset by hiring and retention struggles in the wake of violent protests against racial injustice that roiled the city after George Floyd's death in 2020.\nIn addition to classrooms and administrative buildings, the training center would include a shooting range, a driving course to practice chases and a 'burn building' for firefighters to work on putting out fires. A 'mock village' featuring a fake home, convenience store and nightclub would also be built for authorities to rehearse raids.\nTortuguita had moved from Florida months ago to join the activists in the woods who had been protesting for over a year by camping out at the site and building platforms in surrounding trees.\nSelf-described 'forest defenders' say that building the 85-acre (34-hectare) training center would involve cutting down so many trees that it would be environmentally damaging. They also oppose investing so much money in a project which they say will be used to practice 'urban warfare.'\nTortuguita chose the moniker \u2013 which is Spanish for 'Little Turtle' \u2013 over their given name.\n'Manuel was a warrior for the whole of humanity,\" Tortuguita's father Joel Paez said Monday. 'I told him, 'Manuel, you cannot worry about the whole world ... You are not Greta Thunberg.' I was wrong.'\nTortuguita's death prompted a large Jan. 21 demonstration in downtown Atlanta that erupted into violence as a masked contingent lit a police cruiser on fire, and threw rocks and launched fireworks at a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation, shattering windows. No injuries were reported, but six people were arrested that night and charged with domestic terrorism.\nSince then, local officials have vowed to continue to move forward with the project, with Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens announcing last week that land disturbance permits had been approved for the project.\nThe GBI said in a news release that authorities from multiple law enforcement agencies conducted a clearing operation of the site Monday as part of 'an ongoing effort to ensure that the site of the future City of Atlanta Public Safety Training Center is safe and secure.' The GBI said no arrests were made.",

    "summary": "GAINESVILLE, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Federal officials are pausing a plan that could lead to new names for Georgia's Lake Lanier and Buford Dam after locals objected to changing the monikers of landmarks now named for Confederate soldiers.\nThe U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a statement Friday announcing the pause pending further guidance from the Department of the Army.\nU.S. Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Republican who represents much of northeast Georgia, said he called the Corps of Engineers Friday to express opposition. He said the pause is a 'a tremendous victory' and that 'renamings would have attempted to rewrite history, impose massive burdensome costs on our community, and create unnecessary mass confusion.'\nLake Lanier is an enormous reservoir spanning almost 58 square miles (150 square kilometers) and impounding the Chattahoochee River northeast of Atlanta. It was named for poet Sidney Lanier when it was built after World War II. Lanier served as a private in the Confederate army and later wrote 'Song of the Chattahoochee,' a poem about the river.\nBuford Dam is named after the nearby town of Buford, which takes its name from Lt. Col. Algernon Sidney Buford, who served in the Virginia militia during the Civil War. The Georgia town is named after Buford because he became president of a railroad that helped create the town after the war.\nHours before announcing the pause in the renaming process, The Times of Gainesville reported that the Mobile District of the Corps of Engineers sent out a news release and unveiled a website seeking input and aiming to pick new names by year's end. The corps said it was following a 2021 federal law which governs renaming military bases christened for confederates, including Georgia's Fort Gordon and Fort Benning. Fort Gordon is becoming Fort Eisenhower, while Fort Benning is becoming Fort Moore.\nThe Mobile District said it will continue to solicit public comment about new names for the lake and dam, but said choosing them is up to Congress.\nU.S. Rep. Austin Scott, a south Georgia Republican who was a member of the commission that suggested new military base names, told The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the commission never intended for Lake Lanier to be renamed.\nOfficials in the Gainesville area also oppose the change.\nClyde Morris, a board member with advocacy group Lake Lanier Association, told The Times on Friday that connections between the Confederacy, Lanier and Buford are 'really too remote\" to justify changing the names, saying each man is better known for something other than their time in the military.",

    "excerpt": "ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property, and real estate data, today released its year-end 2022 U.S. Home Flipping Report, which shows that 407,417 single-family homes and condos in the United\u2026",
    "summary": "Number of Home Flips Hits Highest Level in More Than 15 Years;But Investment Returns on Flips Sink to Lowest Point Since 2008;Two-Thirds of Flipped Homes Purchased with Cash\nIRVINE, Calif., March 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property, and\u00a0real estate data,\u00a0today released its year-end 2022 U.S. Home Flipping Report, which shows that 407,417 single-family homes and condos in the United States were flipped in 2022. That was up 14 percent from 357,666 in 2021, and up 58 percent from 2020, to the highest point since at least 2005.\nThe report reveals that the number of homes flipped by investors last year represented 8.4 percent of all home sales, also the largest figure since at least 2005. The latest portion was up from 5.9 percent in 2021 and 5.8 percent in 2020.\nBut even as quick buy-renovate-and-resell turnarounds by investors shot up, gross profit margins on home flips in 2022 sank to their lowest level since 2008 following the second major drop in two years.\nHomes flipped in 2022 typically generated a gross profit of $67,900 nationwide (the difference between the median sales price and the median amount originally paid by investors). That was down 3 percent from $70,000 in 2021 and translated into just a 26.9 percent return on investment compared to the original acquisition price. The latest nationwide ROI (before accounting for mortgage interest, property taxes, renovation expenses and other holding costs) was down from 32.6 percent in 2021 and from 41.9 percent in 2020.\n\nInvestors saw their profit margins drop for the fifth time in the past six years as the median value of the homes they flipped rose more slowly than the median price they paid to purchase properties \u2013 12 percent versus 17 percent.\nThe decline in home-flipping profits in 2022 continued to cast a negative light on a niche of the U.S. housing market that is growing but also struggling to figure out how to profit from changing price trends.\nThe latest drop-off came during a year when the nation's decade-long home-price runup began to stall, leading to the weakest annual gains in three years and even a decline in the second half of 2022. That happened as rising home-mortgage rates, consumer price inflation and other forces cut into what home seekers could afford, reducing demand and cutting into prices investors were able to get on resale. But profits for home flippers had begun diminishing in 2017 even as the broader housing market was booming.\n\"Last Year, home flippers throughout the U.S. experienced another tough period as returns took yet another hit. For the second straight year, more investors were flipping but found no simple path to quick profits,\" said Rob Barber, chief executive officer at ATTOM. \"Indeed, returns are now at the point where they could easily be wiped out by the carrying costs during the renovation and repair process, which usually accounts for 20 to 33 percent of the resale price. This year will reveal more about whether investors decide to find different ways to profit from home-flipping or take a step back and wait for conditions to get better.\"\nHome flipping rates up in almost all housing markets, with biggest increases in South and WestHome flips as a portion of all home sales increased from 2021 to 2022 in 216 of the 218 metropolitan statistical areas analyzed in the report (99 percent). Among the 25 largest increases in annual flipping rates, 20 were in the South and West. They were led by Burlington, VT (rate up 283.7 percent); Prescott, AZ (up 183.1 percent); Bremerton, WA (up 182.7 percent); Jackson, MS (up 176 percent) and Honolulu, HI (up 172.6 percent). Metro areas qualified for the report if they had a population of at least 200,000 and at least 100 home flips in 2022.\nAside from Honolulu, the biggest increases in flipping rates in 2022 in metro areas with a population of 1 million or more were in Sacramento, CA (rate up 116.4 percent); Atlanta, GA (up 94.3 percent); Minneapolis, MN (up 72.8 percent) and Orlando, FL (up 72.2 percent).\nThe only metro areas where home flipping rates decreased from 2021 to 2022 were New Orleans, LA (rate down 8.2 percent) and Green Bay WI (down 2.9 percent).\nHome flips purchased with cash financing decrease again while all-cash transactions go upNationally, the percentage of flipped homes purchased with financing decreased in 2022 to 35.2 percent, down from 35.9 percent in 2021 and from 41 percent in 2020.\n\nMeanwhile, 64.8 percent of homes flipped in 2022 were bought with all-cash, up from 64.1 percent in 2021 and from 59 percent two years earlier.\nAmong metropolitan areas with a population of 1 million or more and sufficient data to analyze, those with the highest percentage of flipped homes purchased by investors with financing in 2022, included Boston, MA (53.7 percent); San Diego, CA (51 percent); Seattle, WA (50.8 percent); Providence, RI (50.5 percent) and San Jose, CA (50.1 percent).\nIn that same group, the metro areas with the highest percentage of flips purchased with all cash included Detroit, MI (84.7 percent); Atlanta, GA (80.7 percent); Buffalo, NY (80.6 percent); Indianapolis, IN (77.4 percent) and Cleveland, OH (77.1 percent).\nTypical gross profits on home flips decline in half the nationHomes flipped in 2022 were sold for a median price nationwide of $320,000, generating a gross flipping profit of $67,900 above the median original purchase price paid by investors of $252,100. That national gross-profit figure was down from $70,000 in 2021 (the high point since at least 2005) but still up from $67,000 in 2020.\n\nAmong the 56 metro areas in the U.S. with a population of 1 million or more, those with the largest gross flipping profits in 2022 were San Jose, CA ($242,625); San Francisco, CA ($163,000); Washington, DC ($146,728); New York, NY (141,332) and Seattle, WA ($137,664).\nThe lowest gross flipping profits among metro areas with a population of at least 1 million in 2022 were in Kansas City, MO ($26,963); San Antonio, TX ($29,000); Houston, TX ($29,901); Indianapolis, IN ($34,532) and Dallas, TX ($36,970).\nHome flipping returns drop in three-quarters of U.S., hitting lowest nationwide level in over 15 yearsThe gross profit margin on the typical home flip in the U.S. last year fell to 26.9 percent - the smallest investment return since at least 2005. The ROI on median-priced home flips nationwide has dropped 15 percentage points since 2020 and is off by 24 points since 2016.\nMargins fell last year as the median nationwide resale price on flipped homes increased just 12.3 percent, from $285,000 in 2021 to $320,000 in 2022. That was less than the 17.3 percent increase in the price investors were paying when they bought homes (from $215,000 to $252,100).\nThe typical home-flipping investment return decreased from 2021 to 2022 in 168, or 77 percent, of the 218 metro areas analyzed.\nAmong metro areas with a population of 1 million or more, the biggest percentage-point decreases in profit margins during 2022 were in Rochester, NY (ROI down from 100.4 percent in 2021 to 55.6 percent in 2022); Oklahoma City, OK (down from 63.6 percent to 35.1 percent); Philadelphia, PA (down from 106.3 percent to 78 percent); Richmond, VA (down from 91.4 percent to 68.6 percent) and Washington, D.C. (down from 61 percent to 42.7 percent).\nIn that same group of markets with populations of at least 1 million, the largest increases in returns on investment on the typical home flips were in Cleveland, OH (ROI up from 26.8 percent in 2021 to 41.4 percent in 2022); New Orleans, LA (up from 54.1 percent to 64.6 percent); Cincinnati, OH (up from 38.4 percent to 47.4 percent); Honolulu, HI (up from 5.7 percent to 7.4 percent) and Orlando, FL (up from 17.6 percent to 18.7 percent).\nAmong metro areas with a population of at least 1 million, the biggest gross profit margins in 2022 were in Pittsburgh, PA (114.2 percent); Buffalo, NY (90.7 percent); Philadelphia, PA (78 percent); Baltimore, MD (72.9 percent) and Richmond, VA (68.6 percent). The smallest were in Honolulu, HI (7.4 percent); Austin, TX (8.2 percent); Sacramento, CA (9.4 percent); Phoenix, AZ (10.6 percent) and Houston, TX (11.3 percent).\nAverage days to flip nationwide increasesHome flippers who sold homes in 2022 took an average of 164 days, or about 5 \u00bd months, to complete the flips. That was up from 152 days for homes flipped in 2021 but still down from 182 days in 2020.\n\nPercent of flipped homes sold to FHA buyers ticks back upOf the 407,417 U.S. homes flipped in 2022, just 8.4 percent were sold to buyers using a loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). That was up slightly from 8 percent in 2021 but remained down 13.9 percent in 2020. It was less than one-third of the 27.4 percent sold to FHA buyers in 2010.\nAmong the 218 metro areas with a population of at least 200,000 and at least 100 home flips in 2022, those with the highest percentage of flipped homes sold in 2022 to FHA buyers \u2014 typically first-time homebuyers \u2014 were Merced, CA (25.6 percent); Visalia, CA (24.6 percent); Springfield, MA (22.2 percent); Laredo, TX (21.9 percent) and Modesto, CA (20.6 percent).\nMore than 200 counties had a home flipping rate of at least 10 percent in 2022Among 955 counties with at least 50 home flips in 2022, there were 219 counties where flips accounted for at least 10 percent of all home sales last year. The top five were all in Georgia: Douglas County, GA (outside Atlanta) (19.5 percent); Lumpkin County, GA (north of Atlanta) (19.2 percent); Clayton County, GA (outside Atlanta) (18.6 percent); Paulding County, GA (outside Marietta) (18.5 percent) and Rockdale County, GA (outside Atlanta) (18 percent).\n\"While declining margin is certainly a cause for caution, it is important to remember that these numbers are somewhat backward looking in that they reflect dispositions of properties that were acquired in 2021 or early 2022 amidst the Covid-induced bidding wars in many locales\", said Maksim Stavinsky, Co-Founder and President of Roc360. \"On the other hand, it is encouraging that investors were able to clear in excess of four hundred thousand properties \u2013 the most ever \u2013 in an environment of rising interest rates, without a meaningful increase in project timelines.\" Roc360 last week announced the closing of its asset acquisition of Finance of America Commercial, a business purpose loan originator, so it is continuing to bet on growth in the space.\nHigh-level takeaways from fourth-quarter 2022 data:\nThe 80,335 home flips in the fourth quarter of 2022 which represented a flipping rate of 8.4 percent.\nThe share of homes flipped in the fourth quarter of 2022 that were purchased by investors with financing represented 33.5 percent of all homes flipped in the quarter, down from 36.3 percent in the previous quarter and from 34.3 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021. The share purchased with cash rose to 66.5 percent, up from 63.7 percent in the third quarter of 2022 and 65.7 percent in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe gross-flipping profit on median-priced home flips in the fourth quarter of 2022 was $50,000, the smallest amount since the first quarter of 2013. The latest figure represented a typical 20 percent return on investment (percentage of original purchase price). That was down from 24.9 percent in the previous quarter and from 27.3 percent in the same period of 2021, to the lowest point since the first quarter of 2009.\nThe quarterly decrease in the ROI was the eighth in the last nine quarters.\nHome flips completed in the fourth quarter of 2022 took an average of 165 days, up from 153 days in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nReport methodologyATTOM analyzed sales deed data for this report. A single-family home or condo flip was any arms-length transaction that occurred in the quarter where a previous arms-length transaction on the same property had occurred within the last 12 months. The average gross flipping profit is the difference between the purchase price and the flipped price (not including rehab costs and other expenses incurred, which flipping veterans estimate typically run between 20 percent and 33 percent of a property's after-repair value). Gross flipping return on investment was calculated by dividing the gross flipping profit by the first sale (purchase) price.\nAbout ATTOMATTOM\u00a0provides premium property data to power products that improve transparency, innovation, efficiency and disruption in a data-driven economy.

A four-star center, Sommerville is hoping to make a decision sooner rather than later.\nSommerville's top seven included Villanova, Rutgers, Seton Hall, Bradley, Xavier, Missouri and Virginia Tech. A 6-foot-10 center from the Skill Factory (Atlanta, GA), he is ranked the No. 92 recruit in the nation according to Rivals.\nHe spoke with Rutgers Wire about his recruitment and why the Scarlet Knights ended up making his top seven after taking an official visit to the program in February.\n'Rutgers is a great place from the staff to the fans \u2013 a lot of great people in the organization and they get their players better and prepared for the next level,' Sommerville told Rutgers Wire.\n'They also have that winning culture and competitive nature that I really like.'\nStarting with JaMichael Davis, a member of the 2023 recruiting class, Rutgers has certainly made Georgia a priority for their program. From McEachern High School (Powder Springs, GA) Davis is a three-star guard who is ranked the No. 215 player in the nation according to the 247Sports Composite.\nAlso from McEachern, Airious Bailey is a verbal to the 2024 recruiting class for Rutgers. He is a five-star recruit and a consensus top 10 player in the nation.\nSommerville isn't sure if there is any one reason why so much talent from Georgia is liking New Jersey right now. He thinks it is not only the direction of the program under head coach Steve Pikiell (four straight winning seasons, three straight postseason appearances) but also the culture around the Scarlet Knights.\n'I'm not really sure, honestly, probably the same reasons that I said (before),' Sommerville said.\n'They're just great people in the organization that make you feel like you are where you're supposed to be when you're there.'\nHe is currently in the process of setting up his visits to Missouri and Seton Hall.",

Thankfully, there is a plethora of video and other evidence, and we look forward to a thorough examination thereof.'\nSchiffer is defending Carroll in both cases that the state is preparing against Carroll.\nSafest community in Maine:Police chief explains why Kennebunk tops the list\nThe Office of the Fulton County District Attorney, which is prosecuting this most recent case, could not be reached for comment.\nDuring an interview on Friday, Schiffer took issue with the fact that Carroll was being held without bond. He said the circumstances in the case do not meet the criteria for denying bond.\n'Arrestees are entitled to bond, absent the state showing of factors,' he said. 'Withholding bond is not supposed to be a punishment.'\nCarroll was released on bond, with conditions, in late December, following court appearances for his first arrest days earlier, according to Schiffer.\nNew scam:Thieves stealing checks from mailboxes in Kennebunkport, nationally. What you should know.\nSchiffer said he could not comment specifically on the charges his client is facing.\n'We need a lot of sunlight between all of the agencies involved,' he said. 'A thorough investigation will reveal what happened and will show why law enforcement specifically chose these individuals to arrest.'\nDuring the incident on Jan. 21, activists dressed in masks and black clothing allegedly threw rocks and lit fireworks in front of a skyscraper that houses the Atlanta Police Foundation. The activists reportedly shattered large glass windows, set a police cruiser on fire, and vandalized walls with anti-police graffiti.\nThe protesters were a subsection of hundreds of demonstrators who had gathered and marched up Peachtree Street in Atlanta to mourn the death of the protester, who went by the name Tortuguita.\nTortuguita was killed on Wednesday, Jan. 18, as authorities cleared a small group of protesters from the site of a planned Atlanta-area public safety training center that activists have dubbed 'Cop City.'\nThe Georgia Bureau of Investigation has said Tortuguita was killed by officers after shooting and wounding a state trooper. However, activists have questioned officials' version of events, calling it a 'murder' and demanding an independent investigation.\nAccording to the GBI, the incident was not recorded on body cameras. The bureau determined the trooper was shot in the abdomen by a bullet from a handgun that was in Tortuguita's possession.\nAtlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum said during a news conference that authorities made six arrests at the protest \u2013 with Carroll being one of them, as confirmed by the DA office in DeKalb County.\nAuthorities recovered explosive devices after the protesters damaged property along Peachtree Street, a corridor of hotels and restaurants.\nSchierbaum said authorities halted the violence within two blocks. No citizens or law enforcement officers were injured.\n'We can tell now, early in this investigation, this was not the focus tonight just to damage the windows of three buildings and set a police car on fire,\" Schierbaum said. \"The intent was to continue to do harm, and that did not happen.'\nOpponents of the training center have been protesting for over a year by building platforms in surrounding trees and camping out at the site. They say the $90 million project, which would be built by the Atlanta Police Foundation, involves cutting down so many trees that it would be environmentally damaging. They also oppose spending so much money on a facility they say will be used to practice 'urban warfare.'\nSchiffer said he could not confirm or deny whether or not Carroll belongs to a specific, organized group of activists and protestors. Schiffer said he has not asked his client that question.\nAsked what has prompted a resident from Kennebunkport, Maine, to take up causes more than 1,100 miles away in Georgia, Schiffer said the issues against which Carroll is protesting are 'borderless' and have attracted people from all walks of life and places. He said the situation includes concerns about environmentalism and police militarism but also goes beyond them.\n'We can't wait to get to court and have these arguments,' he said.\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.\nThis article originally appeared on Portsmouth Herald: Kennebunkport, ME man charged with domestic terrorism for second time",

    "summary": "A 25-year-old woman who vanished after getting out of jail is still missing months later, Georgia authorities say.\nNow there's a $2,000 reward as police turn to the public to help bring her home.\nSelena Garcia was reported missing Oct. 23 from a home she was staying at in Lilburn, according to the Gwinnett County Police Department. Authorities said she last spoke with family members that morning, not long after she bonded out of jail.\nBooking records, however, show she was released around 10 p.m on Oct. 6.\nGarcia is 5 feet, 4 inches tall with brown hair, brown eyes and weighs about 160 pounds, police said. She also has multiple tattoos, including a green marijuana plant on the top of her hand, '503' across the fingers of her right hand and 'Maria' on the outside of her wrist.\nThe Lilburn woman hasn't been seen or heard from in months, and relatives said they believe something happened to her.\n'I think so many things,' her sister told WSB-TV. 'And I do think she was kidnapped. Yes, I do think she was taken against her will.'\nHer sister is praying for Selena's safe return and said she felt police didn't do enough when Selena was first reported missing, according to WXIA. The department has faced similar criticism from the community following the recent disappearances of three Hispanic youth, including 16-year-old Susana Morales.\nA Doraville Police Department officer was arrested and charged with murder in Morales' death after the teen's body was found dumped in the woods more than six months after her disappearance, McClatchy News reported.\nIn a statement, Gwinnett County police said young people who are reported missing and haven't returned home in 24 hours are listed as runways 'for administrative purposes.'\n'However, all missing and runaway juveniles are investigated and treated the same,' the department said. 'No biases are established when the juvenile is missing or is a runaway, and the only goal is to confirm the safety and well-being of the missing individual.'\nInvestigators said they've 'exhausted all leads' in their search for Garcia, adding that it's tougher to investigate the disappearance of an adult without evidence of an abduction or crime, WXIA reported.\nAnyone with information on Garcia's whereabouts is asked to contact Gwinnett County police detectives at 770-513-5300 or submit an anonymous tip by calling Crime Stoppers of Greater Atlanta at 404-577-TIPS (8477).\nLilburn is about 25 miles northeast of downtown Atlanta.",

Gibbs added an additional 570,000 new perennial daffodil bulbs in fall 2022. \"Each daffodil bulb will divide and double every year, adding huge numbers of blooms to the daffodil gardens each season,\" he explained.\nMasses of 'Rijnveld's Early Sensations'\u2014the first daffodils to bloom each year\u2014and 'February Gold' mark the coming of spring, said Gibbs. More than 100 varieties of early-, mid- and late-blooming daffodils will appear every two weeks for a full six weeks of flowers in every shade of yellow and orange\u2014from almost-white to peach and deep-gold.\nThere is an artistry to Gibbs' planting. \"Each fall, we plant new bulbs in unique designs to create rivers of color\u2014flowing waves of golden-yellow blossoms covering acres and acres of hillsides,\" he said.\nStarting in mid-March, fields of tulips are set for early-, mid- and late- season blooming for added weeks of color. Gibbs likes to plant tulips in sweeping S curves of color for dramatic contrast to acres of bright green grass. As daffodils and then tulips slip into bloom, they will be joined in mid-March by more than 200 cherry trees,\u00a0including the same Yoshino cherries seen in Washington, D.C. and Kwanzan cherries along with forsythia, quince, spiraea and dogwood for a spring welcome like no other.\nGibbs Gardens is a one-of-a-kind experience. With 356 acres of mature trees, rolling hills, parkland, artistically designed flower gardens, 20 seasonal flower displays and five unique feature gardens, there's always something new to explore.\nRecognized as one of the Thirteen Best Botanical Gardens in America, highlighted in Explore Georgia and named the top garden in Georgia by the Atlanta Journal Constitution, Gibbs Gardens always has something new in bloom.\nFor more information or to interview Jim Gibbs, contact Carol Skapinetz, carol@gibbsgardens.com, 770-712-1090.\nHi res images available on request.\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/gibbs-gardens-named-one-of-the-worlds-10-best-places-to-see-daffodils-301749495.html\nSOURCE Gibbs Gardens",

    "summary": "Consumers can now view prices others have been charged, with thousands of dollars in potentially costs-savings\nATLANTA, Feb. 16, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Costnip, a digital healthcare technology company based in Atlanta, GA, has recently launched a new online price platform called Pricecare. This platform is designed to help consumers take control of their healthcare costs, which is especially important as over 100 million people in the U.S. are facing healthcare debt and increasing deductibles. With Pricecare, users can save money, identify billing errors, and avoid being overcharged by conveniently comparing the costs of hundreds of medical, dental, and vision procedures within their zip code. This feature provides invaluable transparency and equips users with the knowledge to make more informed decisions about their spending. By taking advantage of this information, users can potentially save a significant amount of money and make smarter choices about their finances.\nThe launch of this platform reflects Costnip's aim to give consumers a comparative shopping experience when it comes to their healthcare decisions. Additionally, the platform tackles the lack of transparency in the healthcare industry, which is prevalent as only 25% of hospitals are currently compliant with transparency regulations. Costnip's platform also helps identify non-compliant facilities. \"By providing users with information they need to make informed decisions, Costnip is helping to reduce healthcare costs for everyone,\" says Brittaney Bethea, Co-Founder of Costnip.\n\"We believe healthcare decision-making should take costs into account when deciding where to go for care,\" says Mike Aldridge, CEO of Costnip. \"Our platform encourages consumers to weigh the costs of care with perceived quality, so they can make informed decisions before services are rendered. Not only are we aiming to reduce the number of people being overcharged, we're revolutionizing how we all think about the value of healthcare.\"\nFor more information, please visit www.costnip.com\nAbout CostnipCostnip is an Atlanta-based digital healthcare company that works to make healthcare decisions simpler.

    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. \u2014 Christian Eckes finished where he started Saturday\u2018s Fr8 208 NASCAR CRAFTSMAN Truck Series race at Atlanta Motor Speedway \u2014 with a lot of turmoil in between.\nEckes claimed his second victory in the series in overtime, choosing the bottom lane and front-row position for a restart on lap 136 of 137.\n\nAfter leading the first 30-lap stage of the race wire-to-wire, however, Eckes sped on pit road and lost track position. He spent the rest of the event working his way back to the front.\nIn a race that featured a record 11 cautions for 58 laps, the driver of the No. 19 Chevrolet restarted 13th on Lap 103, but three yellow flags later, he was on the inside of the front row beside leader and ultimate runner-up finisher Nick Sanchez for the overtime restart.\nEckes surged ahead, took the white flag in the lead and was out front when NASCAR called the final caution of the race for a wreck in Turn 4 involving Tyler Ankrum, Stewart Friesen and defending series champion Zane Smith.\n'It\u2018s been a tough offseason,' said Eckes, in his first year with owner Bill McAnally after driving for ThorSport Racing in 2022. 'I\u2018m driving harder than I ever have \u2014 I have a lot to prove. The people know who they are.\n'I\u2018m really happy. Thanks to (crew chief) Charles (Denike), everybody on this team. They work so damn hard. This is what makes it all worth it. I\u2018m pumped. It\u2018s going to be a really good year.'\nJohn Hunter Nemechek ran third after leading a race-high 53 laps to Eckes\u2018 35. Nemechek had the lead for a restart on Lap 121, but was shuffled back in traffic.\nBayley Currey finished fourth, earning his first NASCAR national series top five, and Ben Rhodes came home fifth after giving Eckes a much-needed push to the lead.\nMatt DiBenedetto, Chase Purdy, Timmy Hill, Matt Crafton and Jack Wood completed the top 10.\nCorey Heim's defense of his Truck Series victory here last March ended early. He recovered from a mid-race pit-road collision, but his Tricon Garage No. 11 Toyota sustained significant front-end damage when he jammed up behind the No. 2 Chevrolet of Sanchez on a restart. He retired after completing just 83 laps and finished 34th in the 36-truck field.\nThe Craftsman Truck Series' next race is scheduled next Saturday, March 25 (1:30 p.m. ET, FS1, MRN, SiriusXM) at Circuit of The Americas.\nContributing: Staff reports",

My design prevents electrodes from becoming loose even when sleeping or engaging in normal activities.\"\nThe patent-pending invention ensures a continuous good recording of an ECG for hours or days. In doing so, it maintains electrode contact with the skin without the use of adhesive tape. As a result, it enables the patient to engage in their normal activities. It also helps to prevent electrodes from moving and allergic reactions caused by tape. The invention features an effective design that is easy to wear so it is ideal for individuals who have cardiovascular disease, medical facilities, etc. Additionally, it is producible in design variations.\nThe original design was submitted to the Atlanta sales office of InventHelp.

For the longest time, we were both in the right seat,\" Kelly said, referring to the flight deck position where pilots with the rank of first officer typically sit.\u00a0\"Then Brent went to the left seat,\" meaning he earned the rank of\u00a0captain,\u00a0\"and I went to the training department.\"\nWhile Kelly has been flying Boeing 737s since she joined Delta, Brent moved around between fleets and only recently got assigned to the 737.\n\"Kelly was able to teach me everything I had to learn,\" he said.\nFlying to all 50 states: Avelo Airlines begins service from Delaware\nTheir first trip together in January\u00a0took them from their home base in Atlanta to Panama City, Panama, back to Atlanta,\u00a0and then on to\u00a0Bradley airport outside of Hartford, Connecticut, and back home to Atlanta. Brent said\u00a0that final\u00a0flight wound up having to\u00a0divert to Charleston, \"not for marital issues, just for more gas.\"\n'Kelly's a great pilot ... She flew the plane, she took us to Charleston,\" he added. \"It was an exercise in crew resource management.\"\nThe Knoblauchs said they alternated who was the pilot in charge on the legs of their trip, a common practice among two-person crews on multi-leg journeys at most airlines.\nBrent and Kelly said it can be hard to juggle a home life and career that takes them both away so often, but they've found a way to make it work.\nCommunication, both at home and on the job, is key, Kelly said, as well as \"being able to snap into your role.\"\n\"Be who you are around anyone else ... it was like flying with any other captain,\" she said of their first flight together.\nBest cities for disabled travelers: These 3 U.S. destinations rank among them\nBrent said it's also good to recognize differences in your partner and be ready to let them take the lead.\n\"We agreed in thinking about some of this Valentine's Day topic, it's always a balance,\" he said. \"Embrace that balance, and when the time comes, be spontaneous.\"\nKelly also took a moment to address a question that she said she's surprised to still get on almost every flight in 2023:\n\"A girl can be a pilot, and you can be a mom too. You can do both\u00a0things,\" she said. \"It works, and it's a lot of fun.\"\nThe Knoblauchs said they try to pack as little as possible\u00a0\u2013 almost always just a carry-on\u00a0\u2013 for every trip, and that one of their must-have items is a small backpack that can be folded up in their other luggage.\n\nSome of their other top tips include:\nBe spontaneous\nAlways pack snacks\n\nGet off the beaten path\nA single-use camera per trip can help you slow down and appreciate those Kodak moment\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Married Delta pilots say it was great to fly together at last",

    "excerpt": "Mar. 1\u2014CRAWFORDVILLE, Ga. \u2014 A 41-year-old Martinez man finds himself in all kinds of trouble after he stole a concrete truck from a gas station in Columbia County Monday morning and tried to elude\u2026",
    "summary": "Mar. 1\u2014CRAWFORDVILLE, Ga. \u2014 A 41-year-old Martinez man finds himself in all kinds of trouble after he stole a concrete truck from a gas station in Columbia County Monday morning and tried to elude local and state law enforcement authorities on a 60-mile chase.\nThe chase came to an abrupt halt after a trooper with the Georgia State Patrol fired gunshots into the radiator of the truck in Taliaferro County near Crawfordville.\nNo one was injured in the bizarre crime, which also included the suspect pouring out cement along a stretch of the westbound interstate highway from Appling to the Thomson exit 175 in neighboring McDuffie County.\nIt was not immediately known whether the cement on the roadway caused any serious traffic crashes, but there were several crashes as a result. The wet cement along the roadway also led to the closure of the interstate for a period.\nAfter the truck became disabled, state troopers, along with deputies from several jurisdictions, including the Taliaferro County Sheriff's Office and Greene County Sheriff's Office, took the suspect into custody.\nMaj. Steve Morris with the Columbia County Sheriff's Office identified the suspect as Erik Adam Bodie, of the 4600 block of Dever Drive, Martinez.\nWarrants have since been taken out against Bodie for fleeing and attempting to elude, due to driving in a manner that would put the public at risk or harm, theft of a motor vehicle, reckless driving, and running a traffic control device.\nThe suspect is also expected to face a litany of other charges in other counties resulting from the chase.\nBodie is being held in the Columbia County Detention Center in Appling.\nLt. Michael Burns, public information director with the Georgia State Patrol in Atlanta said the incident began shortly after 9 a.m.\nTroopers with the Georgia State Patrol post in Grovetown received radio contact that a deputy with the Columbia County Sheriff's Office was in pursuit of a stolen concrete truck on I-20, Burns said via an email.\nEventually, a state trooper assigned to the GSP post in Grovetown became the primary unit during the pursuit at mile marker 183 in Columbia County, Burns said.\nTwo other state troopers attempted to use stop sticks to disable the concrete truck in hopes of bringing the pursuit to an end, but they were unsuccessful, he said.\n\"The concrete truck exited I-20 at Ga. 22 in Taliaffero County and continued north before entering I-20 westbound,\" Burns said. \"Deputies with the Taliaferro County Sheriff's Office attempted stop sticks on Interstate 20 West at mile marker 148, but the driver of the concrete truck swerved toward those deputies and drove around the stop sticks.\"\nThe chase came to an end a short time later when a state trooper riding in the passenger seat with a fellow trooper \"was able to safely fire rounds\" into the radiator and hydraulic tanks near mile marker 146, which ultimately disabled the concrete truck, Burns said.",

    "excerpt": "Kyle Busch said of respect among NASCAR drivers: 'We have completely lost any sense of respect in the garage between the drivers.'",
    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. \u2014 Two-time Cup champion Kyle Busch laments the lack of respect between drivers in NASCAR, saying he's tried to talk to competitors but that hasn't helped.\n'We have completely lost any sense of respect in the garage between the drivers at all,' Busch said Saturday at Atlanta Motor Speedway. 'That's where the problem lies. Nobody gives two (expletive) about anybody else.\n'It's just a problem where everybody takes advantage of everybody as much as they can. We're all selfish, granted. But there was an etiquette that once did live here.\n'Mark (Martin) started it. Tony (Stewart) lived by it. I think Jeff (Gordon) lived by it. Bobby Labonte, Rusty (Wallace) for the most part, Dale Jarrett, for sure. It did exist. That's gone.'\nThe issue of driver respect was a topic Saturday at Atlanta in light of Denny Hamlin wrecking Ross Chastain on the final lap last weekend at Phoenix Raceway.\nNASCAR penalized Hamlin 25 points and $50,000 only after Hamlin admitted on his podcast that he did hit Chastain intentionally after past issues with Chastain.\nBusch referenced Hamlin and Chastain when asked Saturday if he understood the difference between hard racing and taking someone out.\n'No,' Busch said, 'because last year at Gateway was a pretty good representation of cat and mouse and nothing was done. What do we do in those situations?'\nChastain's contact wrecked Hamlin at Gateway last June. About 15 laps later, Hamlin drove Chastain down to the apron on the backstretch before Chastain passed. Hamlin later impeded Chastain again. It got to the point that NASCAR instructed the team to tell Hamlin he had made his point.\nAsked what he would like seen done in such situations, Bush said: 'Drivers to be ethical and take responsibility for their action and race and race hard.\n'If you make a mistake, OK fine, I get it. When you intentionally drive over somebody because they made a move on you or something you didn't like, then you get punched in the face afterward.'\nBusch also expressed displeasure Saturday with Chandler Smith, noting their contact on the last lap at Phoenix while racing for third in the Xfinity Series race. Smith called the contact a 'racing incident' after the race.\n'I've tried to talk to guys,' Busch said. 'They don't listen, so I've lost interest in talking to them. I had a teammate that I talked to, a kid that raced for me two years in the Truck Series real recently who I got into it last week with and tried to talk to him about those exact same issues. Lo and behold, it happened to me three races into a new year somewhere else, so I'm done taking to them.'\nBusch said two conversations with Tony Stewart earlier in his career proved impactful.\n'I think the biggest thing was the impact it had for me was him taking the time and doing that, but also giving him the respect and understanding that he's been around for a long time and raced against a lot of those really great drivers and was a two-time champion at that time,' Busch said. 'So I gave him that respect and we rarely had issues since then. I think that says it.'\nBusch said one solution to the issues on track would be to do in NASCAR what happens at some small tracks.\nInvolved in an incident, the driver gets sent to the back of the pack. It's what happens in the racing that Busch's son, Brexton, does.\n'He already knows that he can't run somebody over because he gets sent to the back,' Busch said of his son. 'I think that's something else, there's no repercussions for running somebody over. If you want to do that, you get sent to the back, you get held a lap, something. But if you spin somebody out \u2014 and I'm guilty of it, I spun somebody out for the lead before or the win before or something like that on accident racing \u2014 but if it happens, then you get sent to the back.\n'Caution comes out, you go to the back. There's repercussions for that right now. That's the short track adage and how these kids learn when they're growing up. Maybe we need to implement that here.'\nAtlanta Cup starting lineup Joey Logano wins Cup pole, leads Ford parade at Atlanta Sunday Cup race at Atlanta: Start time, TV info, weather\nKyle Busch decries lack of respect among NASCAR drivers originally appeared on NBCSports.com",

Austin J. Hawk.\nU.S. District Court Judge R. Stan Baker ordered Booker to pay an additional fine of $2,500. There is no parole in the federal prison system.\nBooker's co-defendant, Jordan Brown, 21, of St. Marys, Ga., is awaiting sentencing after pleading guilty in December 2022 to assault upon a U.S. servicemember involving bodily injury or a deadly weapon, and retaliation against a witness involving bodily injury.\nCHINESE NATIONAL WHO ENROLLED IN US ARMY RESERVES SENTENCED TO 8 YEARS FOR SPYING\nAs described in court testimony, Booker and Brown plotted Hawk's death after he reported Brown to superiors for smoking marijuana. Army regulations required Hawk to report such instances as he had been promoted to the position of squad leader and drug use is a criminal offense under the Uniform Code of Military Justice.\nREAD ON THE FOX NEWS APP\nCourt documents say Booker and Brown later agreed something should be done to Hawk because he was a \"snitch.\"\nFederal prosecutors say Booker sneaked into Hawk's barracks room on June 17, 2020, after parking his vehicle a mile away outside the Fort Stewart Military Reservation and \"unlawfully\" walking onto the post. Once inside the barracks room, he \"slashed and stabbed Hawk repeatedly with a sharp-edged weapon,\" court documents state.\nA medical examiner noted that Hawk received 40 separate stab or slash wounds and cut his hand during the brutal assault. His body was found in his barracks room the next day.\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\"Hawk's family and friends will never be rid of the pain this senseless murder has caused them, but hopefully it gives them some sense of resolve to know that Booker will spend the rest of his life in prison,\" Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta said in a statement.\nFox News' Louis Casiano contributed to this report.",

He called 911 and drove to a fire station, where paramedics took him to a hospital.\nWhen he's finished being treated, Henson said he'll likely face charges, including aggravated assault and reckless conduct.\nThe incident occurred near Dallas, Georgia, which is about 30 miles northwest of Atlanta.\nIrate Walmart customer coats floors in jam, syrup, hot sauce and pickles, PA cops say\nMan chases burglary suspects in dump truck as they run from house, Florida cops say\n17-year-old not allowed to borrow family van shoots his dad, Colorado cops say",

    "summary": "FOX (3) The women of 'Farmer Wants a Wife'\nIf you're one of the millions of viewers who saw the promo for Farmer Wants a Wife during the Super Bowl on Sunday and thought to yourself, \"What in the reality TV nonsense is this?\" \u2014 don't worry, we have some answers.\nBased on an international reality format and hosted by country star Jennifer Nettles, Fox's new dating show sends 32 hopelessly single city women to find love with one of four unattached farmers: Hunter Grayson, 31, from Watkinsville, Ga.; Ryan Black, 32, from Shelby, N.C.; Landon Heaton, 35, from Alva, Okla.; and Allen Foster, 32, Williamsport, Tenn. Each farmer will bring eight women to his homestead for a chance at romance amidst the livestock, hay, and hard manual labor. (If this sounds vaguely familiar to you, it's probably because a short-lived U.S. version of Farmer Wants a Wife aired on the CW in 2008.)\nSo who are these single women competing to be a farmer's wife? They range in age from 22 to 39, come from cities including MIami, New York, and Chicago, and work in a wide array of jobs, from sommelier to cyber security analyst. Read on to get familiar with the hopefuls before Farmer Wants a Wife premieres on March 8.\nAge: 33Occupation:\u00a0Travel bloggerCurrent Location:\u00a0Sacramento, CA\nAge: 28Occupation:\u00a0RecruiterCurrent Location:\u00a0New York, NY\nAge:\u00a024Occupation:\u00a0Psychology StudentCurrent Location:\u00a0Miami, FL\nAge:\u00a029Occupation: Interior designerCurrent Location:\u00a0Phoenix, AZ\nAge:\u00a029Occupation: Accounting assistantCurrent Location:\u00a0Las Colinas, TX\nAge:\u00a027Occupation:\u00a0BartenderCurrent Location:\u00a0Dallas, TX\nAge:\u00a027Occupation: Communications for Global Children's CharityCurrent Location:\u00a0Brooklyn, NY\nAge:\u00a029Occupation:\u00a0Mental health therapistCurrent Location:\u00a0Los Angeles, CA\nAge:\u00a027Occupation:\u00a0Executive coordinatorCurrent Location:\u00a0Dallas, TX\nAge:\u00a032Occupation:\u00a0AMSA at veteran hospitalCurrent Location:\u00a0Orlando, FL\nAge:\u00a027Occupation:\u00a0Restaurant GMCurrent Location:\u00a0Manhattan, NY\nAge:\u00a039Occupation:\u00a0Real estate investorCurrent Location:\u00a0Dallas, TX\nAge:\u00a026Occupation:\u00a0WaitressCurrent Location:\u00a0Boston, MA\nAge:\u00a025Occupation: Veteran affairs advocateCurrent Location:\u00a0Orlando, FL\nAge:\u00a029Occupation: Supervisor of radiation oncologyCurrent Location: Allentown, PA\nAge:\u00a035Occupation: PhotographerCurrent Location:\u00a0Nashville, TN\nAge:\u00a031Occupation: Sales managerCurrent Location:\u00a0Weehawken, NJ\nAge:\u00a028Occupation:\u00a0Medical salesCurrent Location:\u00a0Scottsdale, AZ\nAge:\u00a028Occupation:\u00a0Yoga teacherCurrent Location:\u00a0Kennesaw, GA\nAge:\u00a024Occupation:\u00a0Cyber security analystCurrent Location:\u00a0San Antonio, TX\nAge:\u00a029Occupation: School teacherCurrent Location: Cataula, GA\nAge:\u00a030Occupation:\u00a0BloggerCurrent Location:\u00a0Nashville, TN\nAge:\u00a031Occupation: Horse trainerCurrent Location:\u00a0Moorpark, CA\nAge:\u00a034Occupation:\u00a0Spirituality coachCurrent Location:\u00a0Miami, FL\nAge:\u00a025Occupation:\u00a0Director of marketingCurrent Location: Scottsdale, AZ\nAge:\u00a024Occupation:\u00a0Dance coachCurrent Location:\u00a0Pacific Palisades, CA\nAge:\u00a031Occupation: HR managerCurrent Location:\u00a0Chicago, IL\nAge:\u00a023Occupation: Event coordinatorCurrent Location:\u00a0Midland, TX\nAge:\u00a034Occupation: Content creatorCurrent Location:\u00a0Kansas City, MO\nAge:\u00a029Occupation:\u00a0SommelierCurrent Location:\u00a0Temecula, CA\nAge:\u00a022Occupation: Music booking agentCurrent Location:\u00a0Nashville, TN\nAge:\u00a032Occupation:\u00a0TherapistCurrent Location:\u00a0Atlanta, GA\nFarmer Wants a Wife premieres Wednesday, March 8, at 9 p.m. ET/PT on Fox.\nSign up for\u00a0Entertainment Weekly's\u00a0free daily newsletter\u00a0to get breaking TV news, exclusive first looks, recaps, reviews, interviews with your favorite stars, and more.",

    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. \u2014 With about 30 laps left in Sunday's Cup race, Joey Logano looked around and suddenly saw Corey LaJoie's car near the front.\n'Oh, there he is,' Logano, the eventual winner, said he thought to himself. 'Where has he been all day?\n'Corey just kind of popped up there.'\nLaJoie took a methodical approach \u2014 he ran in the top 10 for only 13 of the first 167 laps \u2014 and found himself toward the front for the third consecutive race since Atlanta Motor Speedway was reconfigured.\nHis career-best fourth-place finish Sunday continued his strong runs at Atlanta, but also showed the growth in his Spire Motorsports team. While it's only five races into the season, LaJoie is 14th in the points. He's never finished better than 29th in Cup.\nLaJoie placed fifth at Atlanta in March 2022 and was passed by Chase Elliott for the lead two laps from the finish in the July 2022 race there. Sunday, his push launched Logano on the final lap to pass Brad Keselowski for the win.\nWhile LaJoie continues to seek his first career Cup win, he was excited about his result.\n'Hell, yeah, there's moral victories,' he said after Sunday's finish. 'If you get \u2026 smashed 35 weekends out of the year, here's an opportunity where you can win. When you can run fourth, there are so many good things wrapped up in that. \u2026 For me, it's huge. For our team, it's huge.'\nAlso significant was that LaJoie was the top-finishing Chevrolet.\n'That's a really big deal for us,' crew chief Ryan Sparks told NBC Sports. 'Just kind of prove ourself and hopefully continue to build a relationship with Chevrolet. It's always great to be (Chevrolet's) top finisher. Obviously, we want to win the race. We're getting closer. I think we'll get up there for the year is done.'\nAfter failing to make the feature in the Clash at the Coliseum exhibition race, LaJoie finished 16th in this year's Daytona 500. He followed that by placing 14th at Fontana, California and then was 20th at Las Vegas and 26th at Phoenix before Sunday.\nHe has an average finish of 16.0 in the first races of the season. He's never had an average finish better than 24th in his previous full-time Cup seasons.\nHis performance this year has him in a playoff spot and ahead of in the standings:\nThree cars from Stewart-Haas Racing\nBoth cars from 23XI Racing\nBoth cars from Legacy Motor Club\nBoth cars from Front Row Motorsports\nAll the Hendrick cars (although their penalties will be appealed)\nBoth Kaulig Racing cars\n'We've started the year off really, really solid,' LaJoie said. 'I don't think we could have started any better. We messed up at Phoenix, but we came back and rebounded and put a good payday in the bank and a couple of points around the guys we are racing as well.\n'It's inevitable that a lot of the guys we're in front of are going to catch us, those guys are the ones that run top 10 and top 15 consistently, so we have to get to where we can, on any given intermediate or any given short track, run in the top 15 a little bit better. We're getting there. Days like this give us more confidence.'\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nSunday's race matched two drivers who are among the best in the sport at speedway style racing dueling for the win in former teammates Joey Logano and Brad Keselowski.\nIt marked the first time they had finished 1-2 in a speedway style race, as Logano passed Keselowski on the last lap to win Sunday at Atlanta.\n'I feel like Brad is one of the top five best speedway racers on the racetrack,' Logano said. 'I feel like I'm in there. A few others that are in there that you just know are really, really good at it.\n'We were kind of duking it out back and forth, side by side, side drafting each other. Okay, this is what you would expect. It's fun going up against the best like that.\n'He works really hard at it. He studies it. He's really smart at speedway racing, for sure. When you think of driver and spotter combinations, you're going against two of the best right there, right? Whether it's T.J. (Majors) and Brad or myself and Coleman Pressley) , if I'm picking a couple pairings of people that understand the draft, those two groups are the best at it. So it was fun to kind of go back and forth there at the end.'\nSaid Keselowski of racing Logano: 'We know each other's moves pretty well, for sure, but it's just a matter of how the cookie crumbles and it kind of came his way there at the end and he made a good move. Kudos to him.'\nIt was a much different ending from their duel on the final lap of the 2021 Daytona 500. Logano led Keselowski when they made contact, triggering a multi-car crash and allowing Michael McDowell to win the race.\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\nBrad Keselowski's runner-up finish continued his improved start to the season compared to last year.\n'We're right there, though, as our team just continues to improve and show what we're made of,' Keselowski said, 'so I'm proud of that.'\nA look at how much better this season has started for Keselowski compared to last year:\nHis average finish in the first five races of this season is 13.2 compared to 19.2 at this time last year.\nHe's run in the top 15 in 85% of the laps run this season compared to running in the top 15 in 37.4% of the laps in the first five races of last season.\nHis average running position in a race is 9.5 this year compared to 18.3 at this time last year.\nSeveral Cup drivers running extra race at COTA Winners and losers at Atlanta Motor Speedway Long: One lap, 30 seconds of action with so much at stake at Atlanta\n\n\n\nCorey LaJoie calls fourth-place finish \u2018huge' for him, Spire Motorsports originally appeared on NBCSports.com",

Some people spent the night in the cars. Others tried walking home. Some spent the night on the floors of nearby stores.\nAfter it was all over, Gov.

'We really learned a tremendous amount after that storm.'\nThe task force made several recommendations that the state implemented almost immediately.\nGeorgia Department of Transportation's Natalie Dale said they created a new position of emergency operations director to better coordinate their response. She said they became more proactive and began pretreating roads with brine and using calcium chloride to get icy areas.\nShe said they continue to improve their strategy.\n'Every storm is different, and so we continue to learn from even the smallest storm and grow from that,' Dale said.\nGDOT went from having 70,0000 gallons of brine statewide in 2014 to 1.1 million gallons and the ability to make 80,000 gallons more an hour.\nDale said crews will be working overtime to make sure the roads are safe for drivers.",

    "summary": "PLAINS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Chad Loshbaugh and his seventh-grade son, Theo, were starting a historical tour for their winter break when they heard that former President Jimmy Carter had begun end-of-life care at home.\nSo the father-son pair from Albany, New York, changed their itinerary and found themselves Wednesday on the Carter family farm in Plains, where the 39th president grew up and about a mile from the one-story house where the 98-year-old now is receiving hospice care.\n'This was an add-on,' to a civil rights trip that is taking them from Atlanta through several stops in Alabama, Loshbaugh said. 'We thought it was important to change our trip to see the site here and pay our respects to President Carter.'\nThe longest-lived American president is garnering accolades and well-wishes from across the world \u2014 from other public leaders and admirers he's never met \u2014 as well as from family and friends in his hometown, where he and his wife are known as 'Mr. Jimmy' and 'Ms. Rosalynn.'\n'It's just surreal to think about it all,' said Carter's niece Kim Fuller, who runs Friends of Jimmy Carter, headquartered down the street from the former first couple's home.\nNews of Carter's condition prompted an uptick in visitors to Plains, a town of about 700 with just a few blocks of retail businesses along the railroad tracks that run by Carter's 1976 presidential headquarters.\nPlains residents have always been proud of the Carters' ascension to the White House, Fuller said, as well as the couple's work afterward on public health, conflict resolution and democracy via The Carter Center in Atlanta. There, the Carters and their programs have monitored elections in at least 113 countries and, among other things, nearly eradicated the Guinea worm parasite in the developing world.\nThose accomplishments have drawn plaudits from people such as Mark Suzman, CEO of the Gates Foundation.\n'President Carter's dedication to making the world a better place has had a lasting impact on countless lives through the @CarterCenter,' Suzman tweeted Wednesday. 'Thank you Pres. Carter for your decades of leadership, service, & wisdom \u2014 the future is brighter because of your work.'\nFormer President Bill Clinton, a fellow Democrat elected 12 years after Carter's single term ended with a landslide defeat in 1980, marked Presidents Day on Monday by wishing Carter well and tweeting out a picture of the pair, who were both Southern governors before their presidencies.\nThousands also have posted personal messages on The Carter Center's website.\n'Dear President Carter, You are the best of us. You always sought the best for our country, and for the world,' wrote Mary Cullen.\nBack in Plains, Fuller said it's 'hard right now' to think about Carter eventually not being around. 'But it's good to see people coming through,' she added.\nFuller, who took over teaching her uncle's Sunday School lessons at Maranatha Baptist Church after he grew frail, said it was a regular occurrence over the years to see the former first couple walking down the street.\n'They've been so accessible,' she said. 'That's just who they are, and he was like that in the White House. Never forgot where he came from \u2014 and he came back home when he was done.'\nCarter's Presidential Library and Museum, located on the same campus as The Carter Center near downtown Atlanta, also has seen an increase in interest this week.\nJennifer Multani, who visited from California, said she gained a new appreciation for his life, including his time in office and experiences before entering politics.\n'His service after the presidency was extraordinary, no question about it,' she said. 'We all need to learn from it to give back to humanity as much as we can.\"\nShe said he 'inherited turbulent times' but still negotiated a peace deal between Israel and Egypt. The leaders of those nations shared the Nobel Peace Prize. Carter received the award in 2002.\nSheri Clayton, a 65-year-old visiting from Houston, remembers Carter's presidency well, with the late 1970s being dominated by inflation, rising interest rates and the Iran hostage situation. Carter made some decisions, including appointing Paul Volcker as Federal Reserve chairman, that would help the economy rebound \u2014 but not until after his defeat to Republican Ronald Reagan. He also eventually freed the 52 Americans being held in Tehran, after the November election.\n'The feeling that I get about Jimmy Carter was that he had a good heart and ... he is for the people,' Clayton said.\nWalking along the paths outside Carter's boyhood home, Loshbaugh said what is perhaps most striking to him is that the same man who accomplished so much got his start, both in life and in politics, where he did.\n'To come from such humble, rural beginnings,' Loshbaugh said, 'it's compelling to think about.\n\"His tenure was just one term. But what he did with his life after \u2014 it's just tremendous in building not only his legacy, but showing what a president do for the country and how they should use their position for their entire lives.'\n___\nAssociated Press journalist Sharon Johnson contributed from Atlanta.",

    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. (AP) \u2014\nBack-to-back wins haven't stopped William Byron from believing he and his Hendrick Motorsports team have a lot to prove in Sunday's NASCAR stop in Atlanta.\nIn fact, Byron said Saturday, there's even more on the line. Drivers of the Hendrick Chevrolets want to show the strong start to the season is not the result of illegally manipulating NASCAR's rules.\nNASCAR slammed Hendrick Motorsports on Wednesday with the largest combined fine on one team in series history for allegedly modifying louvers, which direct air through the hoods of cars. The penalty included a combined $400,000 in fines \u2014 $100,000 to each of its four crew chiefs \u2014 plus four-race suspensions for the crew chiefs \u2014 Byron's, Kyle Larson's and Alex Bowman's included.\nThose suspensions begin with Sunday's race at Atlanta Motor Speedway. Hendrick is appealing the penalties, which also affected the drivers by losing 100 regular-season points and 10 playoffs points.\nAsked if the penalties provide more motivation for the team this week, Byron said: \"Absolutely. I really get excited about coming to the race track right now.\n'If anything it just shows that we're not there yet and we have more to prove and we have more to accomplish. That's a dangerous thing, right?'\nByron qualified 11th on Saturday, while Ford drivers, led by Joey Logano, took the top eight spots. Larson qualified ninth and Bowman was 15th.\nByron won last year's spring race in Atlanta while Hendrick teammate and home-state favorite Chase Elliott was the winner in July. Josh Berry, 21st in qualifying on Saturday, is the fill-in driver while Elliott recovers from a broken tibia suffered while snowboarding in Colorado last month.\nByron took advantage of a restart to beat Larson at Phoenix Raceway last week, following his win one week earlier at Las Vegas.\nFREE TO BE DENNY\nNASCAR also penalized Denny Hamlin 25 points and a $50,000 fine for intentionally wrecking Ross Chastain on last week's final lap at Phoenix. Hamlin posted on his Twitter account that he plans to appeal the penalties, which came after he acknowledged on his podcast his intent to wreck Chastain.\nHamlin tweeted the contact with Chastain was 'common, hard racing.'\nHamlin said Saturday he'll continue to tell the truth despite many believing it was his admission, not his action, that brought on the penalties.\n'I'm always going to continue to be me,' Hamlin said, adding he likes the idea of inviting Chastain to join him on the podcast.\n'It'd be good to have an open, honest conversation,' he said, adding the two have talked. Hamlin said he believes the dispute with Chastain has been settled and won't continue on the track.\nWhen asked why he believes the feud is over, Hamlin said 'just taking each other's word.'\nPENSKE POWER\nIn an outcome that was similar to Hendrick drivers qualifying in the top three spots to open the season in Daytona, Team Penske had the three fastest qualifiers for Sunday. Logano took the pole with a speed of 177.374 mph, followed by Austin Cindric and Ryan Blaney.\n'I'm hoping it's transferrable to the race,' Logano said of Ford's dominance in qualifying. '... This is kind of our wheelhouse when you come to superspeedways.'\nSECOND HOME\nLogano is from Middletown, Connecticut, and said he'll always consider the NASCAR track in Loudon, New Hampshire, to be his home track.\nBut Logano's family moved to Georgia when he was a child. So, to him, Atlanta Motor Speedway \u2014 where he competed in Legends races while dreaming of driving on the big track \u2014 is his second home.\n'To me it's always a dream to win on this race track,' he said.\nCHILLY QUALIFYING\nAfter rain Friday wiped out qualifying for Saturday's NASCAR truck and Xfinity races, temperatures were in the 40s for Cup qualifying. The first driver on the tack, B.J. McLeod, immediately lost control of his Chevrolet, leading to a spin that challenged the theory a cool track would generate more grip for tires.\n'It probably was a little bit more interesting than a lot of us expected with cars spinning out and hitting the wall,' Logano said. 'Nobody really knows what they have for handling yet.'\nDEFENDING HENDRICK\nChad Knaus, vice president of competition for Hendrick Motorsports, said Friday that his team was not trying to work outside the rules. Knaus described the louvers as 'a component we've all come to the conclusion it is not correct and we've all tried to work ... to get it fixed because we've done that with other parts.'\nKnaus said all NASCAR teams have worked together on the Next Gen cars, which debuted in the Cup Series in 2022.\n'That's the thing I think we've all prided ourselves on in the garage is that there's been a tremendous amount of give and take as we've tried to learn how to race this car and work together,' Knaus said.\n___\nAP auto racing: https://apnews.com/hub/auto-racing and https://twitter.com/AP_Sports",

The examiner's office could not determine how she was injured but listed the cause of death as \"subdural hematoma secondary to blunt force trauma to the head.\"\nThe GBI said the woman's remains were exhumed in September 2012 to identify her, but a bone fragment sent for analysis produced no leads.\nRELATED: Michigan Doctor Found Dead Under Ice of Frozen Pond 5 Days After Going Missing\nLast year, the GBI Sylvester Regional Investigative Office, in partnership with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, submitted a portion of the remains to the private DNA lab Othram.\nAfter completing the DNA extraction, a profile was generated and given to the FBI for genealogical comparisons.\nAgents determined Cowan's identity after the DNA sample came up as a match with one of her children.\n\"The research yielded a high probability that the unidentified woman was Mary Anga Cowan, aka 'Angie,'\" the GBI said in its statement. \"Agents obtained DNA from one of Cowan's children and the comparison indicated a parent/child relationship.\"\nRELATED: College Student Goes Missing While Studying Abroad in France, Family Says They 'Fear the Worst'\n\"The assistance of the Baker County Sheriff's Office, Othram, and the FBI Atlanta and Baltimore offices were instrumental in identifying these remains and providing closure for the family,\" they continued.\nRELATED VIDEO: Police: Bodies of Missing Teens Found in Arizona Water Retention Basin\nCowan's daughter, Angelique Hall, told Orlando FOX affiliate WOFL that she held on to the memories she made with her mother as a child.\n\"I was 10 years old, and she was fun, and she was silly and then one day she was gone,\" Hall told the outlet.\n\"I knew she was gone,\" she added. \"And I never imagined they would find her. This is a shock from Georgia finding out that not only her body was found but that a town picked her up out of a ditch and took care of her last days. She was loved, and I hear [she was] buried.\"",

    "summary": "Mar. 27\u2014BRASELTON, Ga. \u2014 Connor Zilisch made a next-to-last lap pass for the lead and scored his first victory for High Point-based Silver Hare Racing in the TransAm TA2 road racing series Sunday at Road Atlanta.\nZilisch hustled his Camaro past Thomas Merrill in the 32nd lap of a scheduled 40-lap race that was cut to 34 because of a time limit. Zilisch is in his second season driving for Silver Hare, which is owned by Maurice Hull and his wife Laura.\n\"We've been working at this for over a year, now, trying to get our first win, and finally being able to do that is really special,\" Zilich said. \"All these guys work their tails off and they care about me, and I'm so thankful for them and everything that they've done for me. Maurice and Laura (Hull), they've taken a chance on me and given me the opportunity to come out here and prove my talent, and we've been working hard and finally got our car to the point where we're really competitive.\"\nZilisch, who started eighth, was in second place for a lap 29 restart, knowing the race wouldn't go the scheduled distance. It ended as rain began falling.\n\"There on that last restart, I knew we didn't have a lot of time to make a move (on leader Thomas Merrill). I was going to have to do something pretty quick and find a way by him. I knew he had a lot more straight-line speed than me, but every time we'd go into (turn) 10A, I'd always be able to outbrake him. I knew if I could get within a few car lengths, I could get down inside of him and get by him. I did that on that lap and ended up getting by him.\"\nThe victory was the second for Silver Hare. Rafa Matos scored the first at CIrcuit of the Americas in 2020.\n\"We finally did it,\" Maurice Hull said. \"We've been knocking on the door for a long time and have had to overcome a whole ton of obstacles to get here. I'm just so proud of the hard work that this team has put in. It's truly a team effort to pull off anything like this, and it's just amazing. I'm really excited. We have great talent behind the wheel, and really great talent in the crew. It's the best group of guys that I've ever worked with, just extraordinary, never quit, made adjustments the whole time to get speed out of the car by changing the way the car drove. It's just wonderful, and Laura and I are truly excited and pleased.\"\nBen Maier, a driver in his first season with the team, started 20th and finished 19th.\n\"Ben had never driven in the rain, he'd never made a pit stop, and it's the first time he'd ever been to Road Atlanta, so it was a miraculous job for him,\" Maurice Hull said. \"He really did a great job, brought it home clean and ran some fast laps, passed some very able drivers. I'm very proud of him. I'm very proud of this whole operation.\"\nThe next race in the series is scheduled May 27 at Lime Rock Park in Connecticut.",

    "excerpt": "The parents of murdered Georgia high school football star Elijah DeWitt filed a lawsuit against a suburban Atlanta mall and Dave & Buster's for not warning about the \"high crime area.\"",
    "summary": "The parents of a Georgia high school football star gunned down in the parking lot of a Dave & Buster's outside Atlanta while on a date with his longtime girlfriend months ago have filed a civil lawsuit over the neighborhood's pervasive criminal activity that comes as the second suspected killer pleaded not guilty.\nElijah DeWitt, an 18-year-old football player at Jefferson High School who had already garnered recognition from NFL quarterback Cam Newton, was shot and killed Oct. 5, 2022, in the parking lot of a Dave & Buster's at Sugarloaf Mall, located in Lawrenceville, a suburb about 30 miles outside Atlanta.\nTwo days later, Kemare Bryan, 18, and Chandler Richardson, 19, both from Lawrenceville, were arrested at a South Carolina gas station and taken back to Georgia to each face four counts of felony murder, malice murder, aggravated assault and possession of a firearm during the commission of certain felonies.\nLast week, Richardson pleaded not guilty to all counts, FOX 5 Atlanta reported. Bryan had already pleaded not guilty last month.\n\nCraig and Dawn DeWitt, the surviving parents and co-administrators of their son's estate, filed a complaint Friday for damages against Simon Property Group LP, which owns and operates Sugarloaf Mall. The wrongful death lawsuit also names Dave & Buster's Jason Choy, the security director for Sugarloaf Mills,\u00a0and Universal Protective Service LLC as defendants.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the State Court of Gwinnett County, alleges that there had been a substantial history of previous crime on the premises and that the defendants, \"knew of the dangerous and hazardous conditions,\" and that said conditions, \"were likely to result in injuries and/or death to their invitees, including Elijah.\"\nThe lawsuit further alleges that the defendants' failure to warn of the crime and dangerous activity they knew about but did not tell visitors about, along with their failure to provide adequate and reasonable security measures, led to Elijah's death. DeWitt's parents said they hope this lawsuit \"will hold the defendants responsible for their share of the responsibility for Elijah's death and prevent another family from going through what they have.\"\n\"This is not the dream we had for our son, instead it has become a daily nightmare that we are unable to wake up from. We are constantly reminded of the opportunities and moments that were taken away from him and sincerely hope that we can use our voices to help bring about some change that will prevent another family from experiencing this in the future,\" Craig and Dawn DeWitt said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital.\n\nAccording to Michael Rafi of Rafi Law Firm, \"When businesses know that their property is dangerous \u2013 either because of crime or other dangerous activity happening there, they have 2 options: 1) warn visitors, so they know about the danger and can make an educated decision about whether to go to the property, or 2) if they choose not to warn visitors, then they need to take reasonable safety measures to protect customers who are unaware of the danger. These Defendants did not warn or keep people safe.\"\n\"Elijah had his whole life ahead of him. He was just beginning his senior year of high school and was set to continue his football career at the next level when his life was cut short on October 5th. This incident was entirely preventable and should not have happened. It is our intention to hold the Defendants responsible for this tragedy and obtain justice for Elijah's family,\" attorney Alex Brown added.\n\"Prior to Oct. 5, 2022, there had been numerous reports of criminal and dangerous activity at the Premises and in its immediate surrounding area, including aggravated assaults, robberies, car break-ins, and firearm-related crimes, about which Defendants knew,\" the complaint says. \"For that reason, as well as others, dangerous criminal activity at the Premises was reasonably foreseeable.\"\n\nThe lawsuit alleges defendants knew the premises \"was in a high crime area\" and seeks an award of \"punitive damages without limitation or cap,\" as well as compensatory damages in an amount to be determined by a fair and reasonable jury for damages suffered, including physical, emotional and economic injuries. That includes for mental anguish, fright shock and terror, funeral and burial expenses and future lost wages and earning capacity making up \"all elements of the full value of Elijah DeWitt's life.\"\n\"The company sends its sincerest sympathies and condolences to the family and friends of the victim of\u00a0the incident,\" Dave & Busters said in a statement to Fox News Digital. \"We have cooperated with law enforcement during the investigation of this matter. At this time, we are unable to comment, as it is currently pending litigation.\"",

    "excerpt": "Cheney Orr/ReutersOn Jan. 18, a small army of Georgia state troopers entered Atlanta's Weelaunee forest, with long guns drawn, to end a months-long occupation by a group of 'forest defenders'\u2014and to\u2026",
    "summary": "On Jan. 18, a small army of Georgia state troopers entered Atlanta's Weelaunee forest, with long guns drawn, to end a months-long occupation by a group of 'forest defenders'\u2014and to clear the way for the urban warfare training camp known as 'Cop City.' Within minutes, an indigenous protester was dead, felled by a police bullet. Law enforcement sources claim the officer acted in self-defense, but witnesses say the deceased was unarmed when they were shot.\nIt's too soon to know what exactly went down, but however the facts shake out, Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n joins a growing list of left-wing dissidents killed by police at (or near) protest events in recent years. And government intervention has only grown more deadly: the events of Jan. 18 marked the fourth such fatality nationally in the last three years.\nWhile the details vary from one death to the next, they are connected by some common threads. All of the protesters shot dead by law enforcement in the years since 2020 had been known, in their lifetimes, as outspoken critics of police violence.\nTurns Out You Actually Can Hold Killer Cops Accountable\nSigns show the image of Manuel Teran who was killed during a police raid inside Weelaunee People's Park.\nThere was Sean Monterrosa, 22, who was on his knees with his hands up when he was shot through the windshield of an unmarked Vallejo (CA) Police pickup truck in June 2020. Less than an hour before his death, he had been circulating a petition demanding justice for George Floyd.\nMichael Reinoehl, 48, and Winston 'Boogie' Smith, Jr., 32, died under very different sets of circumstances. Both were wanted men, loosely associated with 'Antifa' and Black Lives Matter, respectively, who were effectively hunted, then gunned down by U.S. Marshals as part of their 'task force' work in Minnesota and Washington state between late 2020 and early 2021.\nNow yet another life has been lost, at the age of 26, to another militarized police force\u2014a 'multi-jurisdictional law enforcement task force charged with maintaining peace and security,' in the words of DeKalb County's chief executive officer\u2014amid circumstances that remain shrouded in mystery.\nNo body cams were turned on at the time. And Georgia's Bureau of Investigation has reportedly rejected calls for an independent inquiry into the officer-involved shooting. Friends and family of the deceased feel it is they who are under investigation, as police munitions continue to fill the forests, the streets, and the squares of Atlanta with the smell of capsicum and the fog of war.\nSelf-declared anti-fascist activist Michael Reinoehl, who was shot and killed by police in Washington State on September 3, 2020. Above, Michael takes part in protests against police violence and racial inequality in Portland, Oregon, U.S. in this photo taken July 18, 2020.\nThe right has less to fear from police violence than the left\nOne peer-reviewed study, 'Policing Counter-Protest,' compared police responses to 64 protest events, left and right, between 2017 and 2018.\nIn Georgia and other southern states, the study's author found police more likely to detain 'those condemning Confederate statues than those protecting them,' and to arrest 'anti-fascists than neo-Nazis.' But those regional trends mirrored national ones, too: The study found that 'police disproportionately repress left-wing activists,' detaining more than ten times as many left-wingers as right-wingers in a given year.\n\u2018Riotsville, USA' Shows the Birth of Police Militarization\nAccording to a much larger data set collected by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, while less than six percent of protests in 2020 saw the use of violence by antiracist demonstrators, at least 54 percent of police responses involved the use of force. Local, state, and federal agents were found to have used force three times more often on their left flank than on their right. Even in that subset of protests where no violence or vandalism was observed, leftist activists were three and a half times likelier to experience the use of force than their counterparts on the right.\nNowhere were the disparities starker than those protests involving large numbers of non-white participants\u2014with the data showing police intervention occurred in nearly 10 percent of the more than 10,330 Black Lives Matter protests recorded in the second half of 2020, compared to a mere four percent of the estimated 2,350 'Patriot' protests over the same time period.\nAnd when right-wing, predominantly white Patriots have aimed their guns (or hired guns) at government officials, they have almost invariably been taken into custody\u2014alive, and more or less unscathed. By contrast, the forest defenders in Atlanta have been left with the unmistakable sense that, in their own words, 'the loss of our lives remains meaningless to the police.'\nTheir fellow activists say the death of Ter\u00e1n could mean one of two things: On the one hand, it could precipitate the beginning of the end of police militarization in Georgia's 'city in the forest.' On the other, it could mean that the training phase is now over\u2014that a new era of urban warfare has, in fact, already commenced.\nWhy, then, do left-wing protesters keep getting killed by US police?\nIn any police-civilian encounter, in any moment of civil conflict, there is a clear logic of escalation that can lead from 'less-lethal' to more lethal outcomes. There is almost always an alternative logic\u2014that of strategic de-escalation\u2014but as in other times and places since 2020, this has been the road decisively not taken in the Weelaunee forest.\nThe first step down this path of escalation: a chain of command which operates as if local and federal law enforcement is (or should be) at war with enemies of the state, real or imagined.\nAgency leadership at the Atlanta Police Department (APD), the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, and the Georgia Attorney General's Office have repeatedly referred to the activists occupying the forest as 'domestic terrorists' and/or 'violent extremists.'\nThe APD's second-in-command, Carven Tyus, explained the political considerations behind the 'domestic terrorism' charges in a closed-door meeting with Atlanta's Community Stakeholder Advisory Committee in 2022:\n'It's domestic terrorism because they all are terrorizing your neighborhood over there\u2026They do not have a vested interest in this property\u2026Why is an individual from Los Angeles, California concerned about a training facility being built in the state of Georgia? That is why we consider that domestic terrorism\u2026'\n'Can we prove they did it?' Tyus continued. 'No. Do we know they did it? Yes.'\nProtester Killed, Trooper Injured in Shooting Near Atlanta's \u2018Cop City'\nThat seems to have been enough for the Georgia Bureau Investigation, according to the charging documents for alleged 'domestic terrorists' this December. The documents show suspects are charged with 'participating in actions as part of Defend the Atlanta Forest (DTAF), a group classified by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security as Domestic Violent Extremists.' Defendants 'affirmed their cooperation with [DTAF],' in one case, by 'being located on the property while wearing camouflage clothing,' and in another, by 'occupying a tree house on the site, refusing to leave, and posting videos and calls for actions on social media sites.'\nOn Jan. 3, shortly after the first raft of terrorism charges was brought against forest defenders, Gov. Brian Kemp tweeted that 'they will not be the last we will take down,' and that 'the only response we will give is swift and exact justice,' before warning, ominously, 'We will not hesitate, we will not rest, we will not waver in ending their activities.'\nGeorgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp speaks at a campaign event in Kennesaw, Georgia, U.S., November 7, 2022.\nLess than three days after the killing of Ter\u00e1n, Atlanta Police Chief Darin Schierbaum joined the chorus calling for more terrorism charges and counterterrorism operations against protesters, while making the case for a whole new theory of broken windows: 'It doesn't take a rocket scientist or an attorney to tell you that breaking windows\u2026that's not protesting. That's terrorism.'\nCounterterrorism missions imply a militarized approach to public safety. They also call for a steady supply of military-grade weaponry.\nFrom 'non-lethal firing devices' to rocket-powered grenade launchers, high-powered rifles to Mine-Resistant Ambush Protected (MRAP) vehicles, the weapons of war continue to find their way into the arsenals of police departments like Atlanta's (and state patrols like Georgia's) by way of the 1033 program and related federal initiatives. Whatever police departments are unable to acquire through the government's largesse, they are increasingly able to procure for themselves on the commercial market.\nRigorous social science research, using the 1033 program since 2014 as a proxy for militarization, has revealed that the more militarized the department, the higher the number of suspects killed by police in a given quarter.\nResearchers also found that military materiel lends itself to quasi-military tactics and a paramilitary mindset, where suspects 'become enemies that must be violently defeated and communities become foreign territories to occupy and subdue.'\nJoe Biden Hasn't Kept His Promise to Reduce the Prison Population\nThe path to escalation has been paved, too, by a series of federal court rulings giving the police qualified immunity: a level of protection akin to a license to kill, whereby an officer involved in the death of a civilian is shielded from liability as long as they believed they were acting lawfully.\nA protester is detained during demonstrations related to the death of Manuel Teran who was killed during a police raid inside Weelaunee People's Park in Atlanta, Georgia on January 21, 2023.\nBy contrast, civilians seeking a civil judgment face a seemingly insurmountable burden of proof. A wide-ranging analysis of appellate records from 2005 to 2020 showed the courts ruled in favor of the police, and against civilian plaintiffs, 57 percent of the time, and that they were 3.5 times more likely to accept a petition from a police officer than they were from a civilian.\nEscalating battles for Cop City have been blamed on 'outside agitators'\u2014a familiar trope in the state of Georgia, historically used to refer to Black, Jewish, and other organizers who traveled to the south to fight for civil rights. Yet it would appear to be a group of inside agitators\u2014drawn from the ranks of the Republican right and more liberal members of the donor class alike\u2014who have been behind the political demand for a heavy hand against DTAF.\nThe media's unethical double standards\nThe Atlanta Police Foundation (APF)\u2014a public-private partnership aimed at lending 'strategic support' to the APD\u2014has been a leading backer of 'the blue' in their battle against 'the green' for the future of the Weelaunee forest. Flush with corporate donations from the likes of big banks like Wells Fargo, energy firms like Georgia Power, and retailers aligned with the Christian Right (such as Chik-fil-A and Home Depot), the APF has engaged in furious lobbying, political pressure tactics, and a public relations campaign by way of the city's leading daily, all on behalf of Cop City.\nDespite obvious conflicts of interest, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution has taken to parroting right-wing talking points in its protest coverage, claiming to have unearthed 'a seemingly well-coordinated but nebulous group that includes police abolitionists, environmental extremists, and anarchists\u2026responsible for a growing list of aggressive, sometimes violent actions.'\nA who's who of right-wing 'news' outlets have since joined the AJC on the warpath.\nSome of the headlines: 'How Stop Cop City Movement Led to Violent Night in Downtown' (Fox 5 Atlanta). 'This Isn't Protest. This Is Terrorism: Five Antifa Extremists\u2026Pulled Down from their Treehouses' (The Blaze). 'Spoiled Children of Privilege Trying to Burn Atlanta Down' (Andy Ngo). 'Kids...Are Turning into Violent Antifa Monsters' (Tucker Carlson).\nWhat we are seeing, in the wake of the latest police killing, is not only the de-platforming of left-wing protesters, but also the re-platforming of far-right provocateurs, with their tales of paid protesters and crisis actors, of shadowy conspiracies and domestic terror plots.\nI Survived the Neo-Nazi Attack in Charlottesville. Justice Still Hasn't Been Served.\nThe public is correct to be concerned with growing violence in our streets. But those seeking to cast blame on antiracist, antifascist, and environmentalist activists are barking up the wrong tree.\nThis media environment has undoubtedly contributed to an atmosphere of cruelty and permissiveness. But more and more, it is police violence against protesters that is deemed permissible, with calls growing in some quarters for an even heavier hand. Meanwhile, the casualties keep coming, with no letup in sight: dozens more dissidents have been injured by baton blows, tasers, tear gas, pepper pellets, rubber bullets, and other pain compliance methods since 2022. Just last week, another protester was hit by a police car in the streets of Atlanta.\nFor many 'forest defenders,' the risk of death now comes with the territory\u2014but so, too, does the prospect of new life, springing from the forest floor among the ruins of their months-long occupation.\nManuel Ter\u00e1n seemed to understand this at a visceral level: 'Am I scared of the state?' they could be heard wondering aloud shortly before their passing. 'Pretty silly not to be. I'm a brown person. I might be killed by the police\u2026But you can't let the fear stop you from doing things: from living, from existing, from resisting.'\nRead more at The Daily Beast.\nGet the Daily Beast's biggest scoops and scandals delivered right to your inbox.

We feel truly blessed to bring these trailblazers together in fellowship and celebrate their creative works.\"\nThroughout the ceremony, BMI will also recognize the songwriters, producers and music publishers of the past year's 25 most-performed Gospel songs in the United States. The BMI\u00a0Gospel Song, Songwriter and Publisher of the Year will also be named during the event.\nTogether, Tamela and David Mann\u00a0have become staples in the Gospel community and have flourished across radio, television, film and stages around the world. The iconic couple began their professional music careers in the '90s after joining the Gospel group Kirk Franklin and the Family and toured the globe. They went on to develop successful solo careers and joint ventures as a couple in music and beyond, creating Tillymann Entertainment in 2005, a home for all of their many projects in entertainment. In 2018, David and Tamela released Us Against the World, their first collaborative album as a duo. The companion book of that album won an NAACP Image\u00ae Award for Outstanding Literary Work, and the album's singles have topped the charts, including the Urban AC track \"Ups & Downs.\"\u00a0Most recently, The Manns embarked on the acclaimed \"Overcomer Family Tour,\" a mixture of music and comedy, featuring their son David Jr, and their daughters La'Tia and Tiffany Mann.\nAs a solo artist, Tamela has released six studio albums and has received a GRAMMY Award, BET Award, Billboard Music Award and multiple NAACP Image, Stellar Gospel Music and GMA Dove Awards. She was also the first Gospel lead artist in Billboard Gospel radio chart history to score three consecutive No.1 singles from her album Best Days. Beyond music, The Manns have appeared in numerous Tyler Perry plays, films and television shows, including I Can Do Bad All By Myself, Meet the Browns and Madea Goes to Jail, among others, and the pair also starred in their own sitcom, Mann & Wife, and the docuseries, It's a Mann's World.\nIn addition, the esteemed singer, TV host and radio broadcaster Dr. Bobby Jones will be celebrated, honoring his illustrious career spanning more than 40 years. For more than 35 years, he was the host of Bobby Jones Gospel on BET, which was the highest rated show on the network and longest running original cable show in history. Jones is credited for giving Yolanda Adams, Kirk Franklin, Mary Mary and many others their first national exposure on television.\nAn established Gospel singer and songwriter, Jones has received a GRAMMY Award for Best Soul Gospel Performance by a Duo or Group in 1984 for \"I'm So Glad I'm Standing Here Today\" with Barbara Mandrell. He has also received a Dove Award, three Stellar Awards and a presidential commendation from President George W. Bush, among several other awards and accolades.

    "excerpt": "Our staff identified one player that they would like the Vikings to sign this offseason",
    "summary": "The Minnesota Vikings entered this offseason with 25 free agents. They added a couple of them to futures contracts, lost OG Kyle Hinton to the Atlanta Falcons and re-signed both exclusive rights free agents Blake Brandel and Khyiris Tonga.\nAs it sits currently, the Vikings have a lot of decisions to make when it comes to free agency. They are nearly $24 million over the salary cap and will need to find ways to save money while also having capital to go and bring in talent.\nTwo weeks as a staff, we looked at the players that we wanted the Vikings to re-sign, including one from today's list. Last week, we looked at players we wanted to let walk. Here are four players that we identified that we want the Vikings to sign this offseason.\nManaging Editor Tyler Forness-CB Jonathan Jones\nBrian Fluharty-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Vikings need to work on loading up their cornerback room with only three players currently on the roster. The best route to do that for how this team currently sits is by bringing in talent while being cost-effective. That can be hard to do, but with the cornerback class in the draft, that could help out the Vikings. Jones is a talented player that has played in the system that Brian Flores runs for his entire career. At 29 years old, there is still gas in the tank and Jones has the flexibility to play on both the inside and outside.\nColumnist Judd Zulgad: CB Byron Murphy Jr.\nDavid Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\nMurphy, who turned 25 on Jan. 18, can play both outside and the slot role. He only played in nine games last season because of injury but that could bring his price down and make it possible for the Vikings to sign him. Murphy had four interceptions in 16 games in 2021. Adding a young free agent like Murphy, could make it possible for the Vikings to target another position (wide receiver?) in the first round of the draft.\nColumnist Matt Anderson: DL Dre'Mont Jones\nNathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Vikings need to upgrade their defense, but they also need to get younger. Adding a guy like Jones fills both those needs. It's imperative that you can get some interior pass rush from the defensive line in Brian Flores' scheme, and Jones can do just that.\nSince entering the league in 2019, Jones has accumulated 138 quarterback pressures, which is tied for 11th in the NFL in that span among interior defensive backs, according to Pro Football Focus. You always hear that it starts and ends in the trenches, and for the Vikings, they should try to secure someone who can make a difference there.\nColumnist Kevin Fielder: WR Olamide Zaccheaus\nTommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\nOutside of Justin Jefferson, the Vikings don't have many long-term answers at wide receiver. Adam Thielen is 32 years old, and his contract will expire next season. K.J. Osborn will also enter free agency in 2024, opening up plenty of options to improve. Enter Atlanta Falcons UFA Olamide Zaccheaus. Zaccheaus is fresh off a 500-yard season on just 61 targets, marking his first season over 500 yards. He isn't the biggest name, but he's a productive wide receiver who can create separation and should come at a solid price.\nThe Real Forno Show",

    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. \u2014 Clean racing has historically been regarded as a sign of respect, something Kyle Busch openly stated that NASCAR Cup Series garage has 'completely lost' during his media availability Saturday at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\nBusch aired his comments in response to questions about the latest on-track developments between Ross Chastain and Denny Hamlin, resulting in a tangle in the closing laps last weekend at Phoenix Raceway. NASCAR officials confirmed that Hamlin's post-race comments on his weekly podcast, where he openly admitted his actions were intentional, contributed to his eventual penalty for the incident.\nRELATED: Hamlin wrecks Chastain at Phoenix | Hamlin penalized\n'We have completely lost any sense of respect in the garage area between drivers,' Busch said. 'That's where the problem lies. Nobody gives two [expletives] about anybody else and it's just a problem where everybody takes advantage of everybody as much as they can.'\nBusch's frustration wasn't exclusive to his former longtime Joe Gibbs Racing teammate, but the current culture in the premier-series garage as a whole. And he openly acknowledged that it wasn't always this way.\n'We're all selfish, granted,' Busch admitted. 'But there was an etiquette that did live here. Mark (Martin) started it, Tony (Stewart) really lived by it, I think Jeff (Gordon) lived by it. \u2026 So, I mean, it did exist.'\nStill one of the veteran leaders in the garage, Busch states that his effort in instilling the value has fallen on deaf ears \u2014 so much so to the point where he doesn't even try to correct it anymore.\n'I've tried to talk to guys,' Busch said. 'They don't listen. So, I've lost interest in talking to them.'\nAs far as his solution and potential repercussions, Busch was straight to the point: 'When you intentionally drive over somebody because they made a move on you or something that you didn't like, then, you know, you're gonna get punched in the face afterwards.'",

The arrests were the culmination of a months-long investigation by the county's multi-agency narcotics unit, the MDJ reported at the time.\nInvestigators tapped the cellphones of at least four suspected drug dealers, according to warrants in the case, following them to gas stations, restaurants and homes across the county where the suspects were observed meeting with others and allegedly exchanging drugs for cash.\nAgents arrested those who allegedly purchased heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine while continuing surveillance on the suspected dealers, warrants show.\nPolice said they observed several drug transactions at locations across Cobb, with one person allegedly selling heroin to an undercover officer. Another defendant, Jesus Solorio of Atlanta, has been accused of facilitating the sale of more than 1,113 grams of methamphetamine.\nThe complete list of defendants named in the indictment is as follows:\n\u2014 Raymond Agrinsoni\n\u2014 Trent Donavin Barnett\n\u2014 Eduardo Cruz\n\u2014 Miguel Angel Esquilin\n\u2014 Stephanie Nicole Grimes\n\u2014 Terrance Douglas Hamlin\n\u2014 Shakira Harper\n\u2014 Timothy Mathis Kates\n\u2014 Maci Kazarah Kennedy\n\u2014 Skylar Smith Landry\n\u2014 Ronald Sammy Loggins Jr.\n\u2014 Jesse Martinez\n\u2014 Kevin Blake Moore\n\u2014 Cynthia Solorio Ochoa\n\u2014 Kelly Ann Pickelsimer\n\u2014 Stephen Taylor Shriver\n\u2014 William Lester Stephen\n\u2014 Arjorgio Brown Walker\n\u2014 Robert Matthew Wood\n\u2014 Charles Alexander Mcadoo\n\u2014 Jesus Solorio",

The Grammy winner, 41, took to Instagram this week to share her latest tour announcement along with a stunning shot of herself in a sultry, see-through, curve-hugging crystal bodysuit.\nThe 'Cuff It' singer and style icon posed atop a sequin-adorned horse sculpture (reminding us of her Renaissance album cover) in the pic, and also rocked a glittery cowgirl hat, thigh-high, silver fringy boots and eye-catching dangly earrings.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9's bodysuit is one of her latest Studio 54-esque and disco-inspired looks after dropping an LP full of post-1970s house-influenced tracks.\u00a0The 'Alien Superstar' hitmaker's forthcoming concerts in support of her seventh studio album mark her first solo world tour since 2016.\nThe Beyhive can also buy tickets to see her live much sooner than expected, as fans can purchase them beginning on February 6th, according to Ticketmaster. The global tour will officially kick off May 10th in Stockholm, Sweden, and conclude on September 27th in New Orleans. The 'Break My Soul' superstar's summer 2022 record is also up for Album of the Year at this weekend's 2023 Grammy Awards ceremony.\nDescribing the creation process of Renaissance at the time of its release on Instagram, Beyonc\u00e9 wrote to fans, 'Creating [\u2018Renaissance'] allowed me a place to dream and to find escape during a scary time for the world.' She added, 'It allowed me to feel free and adventurous in a time when little else was moving.' (And it helped us all dance ever since!)\n\n\nTicketmaster noted in a recent statement that 'demand for this tour is expected to be high' and that it plans to use its Verified Fan system (after learning from the disastrous effects of Taylor Swift's Eras Tour ticketing) to prioritize tickets for those who register with the platform.\nThe company also said this multistep verification process will 'ensure more tickets get into the hands of concertgoers' and will 'help filter out buyers looking to resell tickets' and automated bots.\nEUROPE\nMay 10, 2023 \u2013 Stockholm, SE \u2013 Friends Arena\nMay 14, 2023 \u2013 Brussels, BE \u2013 King Baudouin Stadium\nMay 17, 2023 \u2013 Cardiff, UK \u2013 Cardiff Principality Stadium\nMay 20, 2023 \u2013 Edinburgh, UK \u2013 BT Murrayfield Stadium\nMay 23, 2023 \u2013 Sunderland, UK \u2013 Stadium of Light\nMay 26, 2023 \u2013 Paris, FR \u2013 Stade de France\nMay 29, 2023 \u2013 London, UK \u2013 Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\nMay 30, 2023 \u2013 London, UK \u2013 Tottenham Hotspur Stadium\nJune 08, 2023 \u2013 Barcelona, ES \u2013 Olympic Stadium\nJune 11, 2023 \u2013 Marseille, FR \u2013 Orange Velodrome\nJune 15, 2023 \u2013 Cologne, DE \u2013 Rhein Energie Stadion\nJune 17, 2023 \u2013 Amsterdam, NL \u2013 Johan Cruijff Arena\nJune 21, 2023 \u2013 Hamburg, DE \u2013 Volksparkstadion\nJune 24, 2023 \u2013 Frankfurt, DE \u2013 Deutsche Bank Park\nJune 27, 2023 \u2013 Warsaw, PL \u2013 PGE Narodowy\n\n\nNORTH AMERICA\nJuly 8, 2023 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 Rogers Centre\nJuly 9, 2023 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 Rogers Centre\nJuly 12, 2023 \u2013 Philadelphia, PA \u2013 Lincoln Financial Field\nJuly 15, 2023 \u2013 Nashville, TN \u2013 Nissan Stadium\nJuly 17, 2023 \u2013 Louisville, KY \u2013 L&N Federal Credit Union Stadium\nJuly 20, 2023 \u2013 Minneapolis, MN \u2013 Huntington Bank Stadium\nJuly 22, 2023 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Soldier Field Stadium\nJuly 23, 2023 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Soldier Field Stadium\nJuly 26, 2023 \u2013 Detroit, MI \u2013 Ford Field\nJuly 29, 2023 \u2013 East Rutherford, NJ \u2013 MetLife Stadium\nJuly 30, 2023 \u2013 East Rutherford, NJ \u2013 MetLife Stadium\nAug. 01, 2023 \u2013 Boston, MA \u2013 Gillette Stadium\nAug. 03, 2023 \u2013 Pittsburgh, PA \u2013 Acrisure Stadium\nAug. 05, 2023 \u2013 Washington, DC \u2013 FedEx Field\nAug. 06, 2023 \u2013 Washington, DC \u2013 FedEx Field\nAug. 09, 2023 \u2013 Charlotte, NC \u2013 Bank of America Stadium\nAug. 11, 2023 \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nAug. 12, 2023 \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 Mercedes-Benz Stadium\nAug. 16, 2023 \u2013 Tampa, FL \u2013 Raymond James Stadium\nAug. 18, 2023 \u2013 Miami, FL \u2013 Hard Rock Stadium\nAug. 21, 2023 \u2013 St. Louis, MO \u2013 Dome at America's Center\nAug. 24, 2023 \u2013 Phoenix, AZ \u2013 State Farm Stadium\nAug. 26, 2023 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV \u2013 Allegiant Stadium\nAug. 30, 2023 \u2013 San Francisco, CA \u2013 Levi's Stadium\nSept. 02, 2023 \u2013 Inglewood, CA \u2013 SoFi Stadium\nSept. 03, 2023 \u2013 Inglewood, CA \u2013 SoFi Stadium\nSept. 11, 2023 \u2013 Vancouver, BC \u2013 BC Place\nSept. 13, 2023 \u2013 Seattle, WA \u2013 Lumen Field\nSept. 18, 2023 \u2013 Kansas City, MO \u2013 GEHA Field At Arrowhead Stadium\nSept. 21, 2023 \u2013 Dallas, TX \u2013 AT&T Stadium\nSept. 23, 2023 \u2013 Houston, TX \u2013 NRG Stadium\nSept. 23, 2023 \u2013 Houston, TX \u2013 NRG Stadium\nSept. 27, 2023 \u2013 New Orleans, LA \u2013 Caesars Superdome",

    "excerpt": "While new customer additions are likely to have boosted Southern Company's (SO) profit levels in the fourth quarter, escalation in costs might have played spoilsport.",
    "summary": "The Southern Company SO is set to release fourth-quarter results on Feb 16. The current Zacks Consensus Estimate for the to-be-reported quarter is a profit of 24 cents per share on revenues of $6.1 billion.Let's delve into the factors that might have influenced the power supplier's performance in the December quarter. But it's worth taking a look at Southern Company's previous-quarter results first.\nIn the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based service provider missed the consensus mark due to a spike in operations and maintenance costs. Southern Company had reported adjusted earnings per share of $1.31, lagging the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.33. However, revenues of $8.4 billion came in 24.1% above the consensus mark, backed by the positive effects of rates, usage and pricing changes, and a demand boost from favorable weather.SO topped the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the last four quarters. The utility has a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 8.8%, on average. This is depicted in the graph below:\n\nSouthern Company (The) price-eps-surprise | Southern Company (The) Quote\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for the fourth-quarter bottom line has remained the same in the last seven days. The estimated figure indicates a 33.3% decrease year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues, meanwhile, suggests a 5.7% improvement from the year-ago period.\nSouthern Company's seven major regulated utilities serve approximately nine million electric and natural gas customers. Leveraging the demographics of its operating territories, the firm has been successfully expanding its regulated business customer base. As proof of that effort, Southern Company added nearly 11,000 new residential electric customers and more than 8,000 residential natural gas customers in the third quarter. This trend most likely continued in the October-December period of 2022 because of healthy economic development across its service territories.In particular, the firm is expected to have benefited from higher retail electricity sales, reflecting economic recovery in the Southeast in the form of demand from industrial buyers. Finally, investment in state-regulated electric/gas franchises and continued trends in hybrid working have most likely buoyed Southern Company's revenues and cash flows.On a somewhat bearish note, the power supplier's total operating cost in the third quarter increased 37% year over year to $6.2 billion. The upward cost trajectory is likely to have continued in the second quarter due to inflationary pressures.\nThe proven Zacks model does not conclusively show that Southern Company is likely to beat estimates in the third quarter. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the chances of beating estimates. But that's not the case here.You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Earnings ESP: Earnings ESP, which represents the difference between the Most Accurate Estimate and the Zacks Consensus Estimate, for this company is 0.55%.Zacks Rank: Southern Company currently carries a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).\nWhile an earnings beat looks uncertain for Southern Company, here are some firms from the utilities space that you may want to consider on the basis of our model:NiSource Inc. NI has an Earnings ESP of +1.03% and a Zacks Rank #2. The firm is scheduled to release earnings on Feb 22.For 2023, NiSource Works has a projected earnings growth rate of 6.4%.

    "summary": "The Wildfire Next Generation System (WiNGS) prioritizes mitigation efforts to help protect the region from the threat of wildfire\nSAN DIEGO, March 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- San Diego Gas & Electric (SDG&E) was recently honored with a \"2023 Chartwell Best Practices Award\" for developing and using the Wildfire Next Generation System, or WiNGS, to help protect communities it serves from regional wildfire risk.\n\"We're very excited to present this award to SDG&E. Their Wildfire Next Generation System is exactly the kind of innovative program that Chartwell Awards were designed to highlight. We look forward to the opportunity for other utilities to learn from SDG&E's experience at PowerUp this summer,\" said Russ Henderson, Chartwell Director of Research.\nWiNGS is a cloud-based tool that combines visual representations of SDG&E's infrastructure with real-time weather data and information from wildfire mitigation initiatives, including but not limited to historical ignitions, tree strike analysis, wildfire modeling, Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) probability and critical customer locations. The state-of-the-art system models climate scenarios and recommends grid hardening initiatives, like prioritizing and strategically undergrounding power lines in high-risk areas, to help prevent utility-related wildfires, reduce the likelihood and duration of PSPS, and mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n\"We developed the Wildfire Next Generation System to provide decision makers with real-time information on scenarios and action plans to reduce the risk of wildfires during high winds and other extreme weather conditions,\" said Ben Gordon, SDG&E Senior Vice President, Chief Information Officer and Chief Digital Officer. \"This system is also invaluable in making proactive decisions to prioritize wildfire prevention efforts.\"\nAbout WiNGSIn November of 2021, SDG&E's IT Digital Innovation team partnered with the Wildfire Mitigation team to create a proof of concept to explore two goals: 1) to use data and analytics to produce visualizations that support Public Safety Power Shutoff (PSPS) decision-making by allowing users to run hypothetical scenarios based on changing requirements and parameters, like weather conditions and 2) support the Company's Wildfire Mitigation Program investments by providing SDG&E leaders and scientists with a geospatial view of recommended mitigation actions and associated risk reduction.\n\"WiNGS has proven to be a vital tool to help us prioritize wildfire hardening projects based on robust fire science data and real-world situations,\" said Brian D'Agostino SDG&E Vice President of Wildfire and Climate Science. \"The intel it provides allows us to strategically make infrastructure improvements that will continue to help reduce the risk of wildfire, as well as the impacts to our customers during Public Safety Power Shutoffs in the future.\"\nWiNGS has become another important tool in SDG&E's toolbox to reduce the chances of a utility-related wildfire and helps guide the development and implementation of its Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP) filed annually with the Office of Energy Infrastructure Safety. The WMP outlines the ongoing practices and additional improvements SDG&E will make to combat the effects of climate change and year-round wildfire threats. For more information on SDG&E most recent WMP, please visit sdge.com/2022-wildfire-mitigation-plan.\nAbout the Chartwell Best Practices AwardFounded in 1993 and based in Atlanta, Chartwell, Inc, provides strategic utility-focused research and issue-targeted forums for collaboration among industry peers.

An overdose on the drug can mimic that of an opioid overdose but since it's not an opioid, drugs like Narcan can not reverse xylazine overdoses.\nIt also causes skin to rot with repeated use.\n'Repeated injection of xylazine is also associated with severe, necrotic skin ulcerations,' health officials said. 'Persons who use drugs may not be aware of the presence of xylazine in their drug supply, so it is critical for them to understand these risks and remain vigilant.'\nXylazine-Involved Overdose Deaths FINAL_3.8.23 by ActionNewsJax on Scribd\n\nAccording to data from the Georgia Department of Health, Southeast Georgia has seen deaths related to the drug. Glynn County recorded more than 10 xylazine-involved overdose deaths in 2022. Camden and Brantley counties each recorded one to five xylazine-involved overdose deaths in 2022.\nThe drug is known by the street names 'tranq,' 'tranq dope' and 'zombie drug' and is used by dealers to bulk up fentanyl,\u00a0according to the New York Times.\u00a0The drug causes sores that can necrotize and lead to amputation.\n[SIGN UP: Action News Jax Daily Headlines Newsletter]\nDeaths from the drugs increased 1,120% between 2020 and 2022 in Georgia. All of the suspected xylazine-involved deaths in 2022 also involved fentanyl, officials said.\nXylazine overdose deaths between 2020 and 2022 increased faster among women than men. While all of the overdose deaths involved fentanyl, 19% involved cocaine and 34% involved amphetamines.\nClick here to download the free Action News Jax news and weather apps, click here to download the Action News Jax Now app for your smart TV and click here to stream Action News Jax live.",

    "summary": "AJ Mast/AP/Shutterstock\nUniversity of Georgia football star Jalen Carter has surrendered to police following a car crash that killed his teammate and a team staffer.\nCarter, 21, turned himself in at the Athens-Clarke County Jail at 11:33 p.m. local time on Wednesday evening, and was released at 11:49 p.m. that same night, jail records show.\nThe defensive tackle is currently charged with two misdemeanors \u2014 reckless driving and racing on highways/streets.\nPolice had previously issued an arrest warrant for Carter on Wednesday for his alleged involvement in the incident that\u00a0killed his teammate, Devin Willock, and team staff member Chandler LeCroy.\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\nJohn Adams/Icon Sportswire via Getty\n\nPolice allege that Carter, in a 2021 Jeep Trackhawk, and LeCroy, 24, in a 2021 Ford Expedition, had been racing after they left Athens, Ga. just after 2:30 a.m.\n\"The evidence demonstrated that both vehicles switched between lanes, drove in the center turn lane, drove in opposite lanes of travel, overtook other motorists and drove at high rates of speed, in an apparent attempt to outdistance each other,\" police said in a prior statement to PEOPLE.\nAuthorities said they believe LeCroy was\u00a0speeding at 104 miles per hour\u00a0and had also been intoxicated, with a blood alcohol concentration of .197, during the time of the crash.\nIcon Sportswire via AP Images; Chandler LeCroy/Instagram\nThe Atlanta Journal-Constitution\u00a0reported based on documents obtained from the Athens-Clarke County Police Department that Carter had spoken to officers on the scene and provided clashing statements. He reportedly told officers initially that he heard the crash from a nearby apartment building, then claimed that he had been driving behind LeCroy. He had also allegedly denied he had been racing to the police.\nThe Athens-Clarke County Police Department said in an initial\u00a0report released days after the crash\u00a0that LeCroy \"failed to negotiate a left curve, resulting in the vehicle striking a curb with its front passenger tire and leaving the roadway,\" going on to strike a \"[Georgia] Power Pole and another utility pole cutting them in half.\"\nHer car then \"struck a tree with its rear passenger quarter panel\" and the vehicle began \"rotating clockwise\" before striking another tree on the driver's side. Willock had been ejected from the vehicle and died at the scene, per the report. The crash happened at 2:45 a.m., just hours after fans packed Sanford Stadium to celebrate the team's national championship.\n\nSteve Limentani/ISI Photos/Getty\nFormer UGA players, like\u00a0Jordan Davis of the Philadelphia Eagles, and current players, like linebacker Nolan Smith, shared tributes to both Willock and LeCroy on social media following news of the crash.\n\"Devin and Chandler were two special people who meant so much to the University of Georgia, our football program and our athletic department,\"\u00a0a statement from UGA read. \"We ask that everyone keep their families in your prayers during this very difficult time.\"",

    "summary": "FLOWERY BRANCH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 The Atlanta Falcons announced a plethora of changes to head coach Arthur Smith's staff on Monday, further restructuring his assistants after a fifth straight losing season.\nMost notably, Steve Jackson will take over as secondary coach, while David Huxtable has been hired as a senior defensive assistant after spending 40 years at the collegiate level.\nJackson and Huxtable will work under new defensive coordinator Ryan Nielsen, who was hired away from the rival New Orleans Saints last month after the retirement of Dean Pees.\nThree assistants were not retained by Smith after a 7-10 season: secondary coach Jon Hoke, defensive line coach Gary Emanuel and outside linebackers coach Ted Monachino.\nHoke will be replaced by Jackson, who was on staff as a senior offensive assistant last season. He spent 19 seasons as a secondary coach prior to joining the Falcons.\nHuxtable's long tenure in the college ranks includes 18 seasons as a defensive coordinator. His most recent coordinator stint was at North Carolina State from 2013-19, where he coached with Nielsen.\nHuxtable spent the past two seasons as an analyst for Alabama coach Nick Saban.\nIn other changes, the Falcons announced Nick Perry as assistant wide receivers coach, Shawn Flaherty as assistant offensive line coach, Lanier Goethie as defensive front specialist, Patrick Kramer as offensive assistant, Steven King as offensive assistant, Mario Jeberaeel as special projects assistant for defense, Matt Baker as special teams assistant, Michael Gray as football analyst, and Mateo Kambui as a diversity coaching hire working with the offensive line.\nThe Falcons did not announce a replacement for quarterbacks coach Charles London, who left to take a similar job with the Tennessee Titans. Smith calls plays and largely runs the offense, while Dave Ragone serves as coordinator on that side of the line.\n___\nAP NFL: https://apnews.com/hub/nfl and https://twitter.com/AP_NFL\nThe Associated Press",

    "summary": "ATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 10, 2023 / FWM Designers LLC a company revolutionizing the way business is done, is proud to announce its innovative approach to supporting non-profit organizations and businesses of all sizes. Through their unique partnership with a credit card processing agency, FWM has developed a system that significantly reduces merchant services expenses, while promoting entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and philanthropy.\nThis unique company, with a target market that includes consumers who support nonprofits, the nonprofits themselves, and businesses owned by veterans, first responders, and civilians, is leading a community-based movement that focuses on entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and philanthropy.\nAt the center of FWM's innovative approach is its partnership with a credit card processing agency, which has allowed them to develop a system that reduces merchant services expenses by 100%. With six other systems under contract, FWM is working to establish a commission structure that supports its mission of increasing the economic capacity of consumers and nonprofits alike.\nFWM sets itself apart from the competition by having businesses that join the FWM system, named Good Circles, agree to offer a 10% discount to nonprofit consumers and donate 10% of their net profits to the nonprofit being supported. Depending on how they onboard, 1-5% of net profits are provided to FWM to help fund the Good Circles programs. This approach has proven successful, with FWM increasing funding for nonprofits by up to 461% over typical American standards, and increasing consumer purchasing power by 10%.\nThe company's impact can be seen in two key achievements, including providing lodging for a veteran separated from service, restoring 401k funds, and removing a lean on a disabled adult daughter's home, after her family's situation had been jeopardized.\nFWM's driving force is to make a real difference in the industry through community impact and statistics-based programs. Timothy Franklin, the founder of FWM, brings a unique perspective to the business world.\nTimothy was medically retired from the military in 2009 and fell into independent contracting. He was eventually caught up in a situation that resulted in a billing error and, as a result, he was robbed and arrested facing felony charges for a crime he did not commit. This led to him becoming un-employable and unable to contract, which made business ownership the only way to support his family. In response, Timothy and his wife started a business in the promotional merchandising space, working with both for-profit and non-profit entities.\nThrough his research and experience, Timothy has become a leading expert in entrepreneurship, particularly in the areas of tax, finance, and financial literacy. His expertise is at the center of FWM's innovative approach, which is based on a partnership with a credit card processing agency. This has allowed FWM to develop a system that significantly reduces merchant services expenses while promoting entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and philanthropy.\nJoin the movement with FWM Designers LLC, a company making a positive impact in their community and revolutionizing the way we do business.\nAbout\nFWM Designers LLC is a company that has developed a system that reduces merchant services expenses by 100%, while promoting entrepreneurship, financial literacy, and philanthropy.

They call it Operation Nightingale.\nFederal prosecutors say instead of going to class, the nurses bought degrees and transcripts.\nWilliams, a nurse herself, counters that not everyone with a degree from those schools bought a bogus degree.\nSTORY: Chrisley's daughter describes \u2018toughest week of my life' after Todd and Julie report to prison\nFor years, prosecutors acknowledge the schools were real, accredited nursing schools. Williams maintains that her clients earned their degrees.\n'Look, nobody wants a fraudulent nurse taking care of them or their loved ones.

We have to allow that process to play out before we rush to judgment,' Williams said.\nSTORY: AP African-American studies dropped by College Board after rejection from Florida officials\nThe surrender letters were sent on Jan. 17 and so far none of the nurses has surrendered their licenses.\n'It's concerning and alarming,' Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger told Gray.\nRaffensperger's office oversees the Nursing Board.\nSTORY: Worker at New Jersey gas station injured while trying to thwart carjacker\n'Our job is to make sure that our people in Georgia, our patients know they have credentialed nurses that are practicing there,' Raffensperger said.\n'The fact of the matter is the nursing candidates had done no work for these diplomas,' said U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida Markenzy Lapointe.\nSTORY: SJSO deputy arrested following investigation into child sexual abuse material, authorities say\nChannel 2 Action News\u00a0has confirmed three of those nurses accused of having sham degrees worked at the Atlanta VA Medical Center.\n'Within days of learning of this nationwide scheme, we removed three nurses from patient care at the Atlanta VA Medical Center. Their removal is very unfortunate but patient safety is and must be our primary responsibility at VA,' said VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes.\nSTORY: Michigan woman turns in bag filled with nearly $15K she found while walking to work\nSecretary Raffensperger says state investigators are now working with the FBI to get the evidence needed to revoke the licenses of any of the nurses who refuse to surrender them voluntarily.\nWilliams says her clients are eager to defend their licenses and reputations through the proper channels.\n'There's been no determination of wrongdoing by any type of judicial body. So to rush to judgment and start firing nurses just because they went to an accredited school that's been implicated in criminal activity is just wrong,' Williams told Gray.\nCLICK HERE to read the original WSB-TV article.\nSTAY UPDATED:\u00a0Download the Action News Jax app for live updates on breaking stories",

One current SPARK Lab participant of note is Chef Sonya Jones, owner of the beloved Sweet Auburn Bread Company, which has been doing business in Sweet Auburn for nearly three decades.\n\"Thanks to design support and funding from SPARK Lab, my space at 234 Auburn Ave. is currently undergoing renovations to make the nearly 500 square-foot bakery more efficient for business operations and customer patronage alike,\" Chef Jones shared. \"Through an innovative partnership between Sweet Auburn Works and the Savannah College of Art and Design, Executive Director Varnell led a class of marketing and business graduate students through drawing concepts for the renovation. Then I worked with the student cohort to agree on a final design. I can't wait to see how their creative ideas improve my business!\"\nDonor funding for SPARK Lab paid for the upgrades, which will include new countertops, baking equipment, lighting and plumbing upgrades throughout the bakery. The SPARK Lab aims to support 20 or more entrepreneurs during its first three years of operation.\nComplementing these customized business interventions is the forthcoming Heroes Walk, a historical walking trail that will stretch 1.1 miles, from the Jackson Street Bridge, down to Auburn Avenue and further south to Historic Oakland Cemetery. The Heroes Walk will pair new storytelling opportunities- both digital and physical - with public art and pedestrian amenities such as new tree canopy, benches, sidewalk improvements and bike lanes. Taken together, these improvements will draw locals and visitors alike deeper into the Sweet Auburn neighborhood, encouraging them to learn about historic and modern-day Black leaders who worked and lived in the district and to patron local businesses during their visit. With full campaign funding, the Heroes Walk is expected to break ground in 2023 and be completed in 2024.\nThese investments underscore Truist Foundation's commitment to supporting innovative, community-driven approaches to help BIPOC-owned businesses thrive and further advance the foundation's recently announced strategic initiative, Where It Starts.\n\"Truist Foundation believes bringing together entrepreneurs of color, partner organizations and community leaders to co-create solutions can be the start to breaking down systemic barriers for small business owners in the Sweet Auburn Historic District,\" said Lynette Bell, president of Truist Foundation. \"We are proud to contribute to Sweet Auburn Works' Walking with Heroes campaign, which perfectly illustrates how the power of collaboration can honor a community's history while dismantling deep-rooted inequities.\"\n\"We are so grateful to Truist Foundation and Truist Trusteed Foundations for understanding how these two initiatives work together to bolster the local economy in Sweet Auburn, while also paying homage to our unique neighborhood's rich history and present-day promise,\" said Varnell.\nAbout Truist Trusteed Foundations\nTruist Bank provides trustee services to private and family foundations, including the Florence C. and Harry L.

    "excerpt": "Chad Knaus: 'Nobody is holding the single-source providers accountable at the level that they need to be .... we're not getting the right parts.'",
    "summary": "HAMPTON, Ga. \u2014 Hendrick Motorsports' Chad Knaus responded forcefully Friday to penalties NASCAR levied against the organization for issues with its hood louvers. He put the onus on NASCAR and single-source suppliers.\nNASCAR stated that the hood louvers on all four Hendrick cars were found to be modified March 10 at Phoenix Raceway. Series officials took the parts after Cup practice that day.\nNASCAR fined all four of Hendrick Motorsports' crew chiefs $100,000 each and penalized Alex Bowman, Kyle Larson and William Byron 100 points and 10 playoff points each, along with the their teams and the No. 9 team.\nHendrick Motorsports issued a statement Wednesday and said that it was appealing. Knaus, vice president of competition, used stronger language when meeting with the media Friday at Atlanta Motor Speedway.\n'I think it's a terrible situation, not only for us, but the industry to be quite honest with you,' Knaus said. 'I think that's what I dislike the most. It's ugly. We should't be in this situation and it's really unfortunate that we are because it doesn't help anybody.'\nAsked to explain, Knaus said: 'We as a company, we in the garage, every one of these teams here are being held accountable to put their car out there to go through inspection and perform at the level they need to. The teams are being held accountable for doing that.\n'Nobody is holding the single-source providers accountable at the level that they need to be to give us the parts we need. That goes through NASCAR's distribution center and NASCAR's approval process to get those parts, and we're not getting the right parts.\n'There's so many areas that we've got to continue to improve upon,' Knaus said, referring to the sport. 'Again, that's where I'm probably most disappointed is that we've been going down this path, working collectively as a group for some time and for this to pop up like this is really disappointing.'\nElton Sawyer, NASCAR senior vice president of competition, said earlier this week that the hood louvers had been modified.\n'It was obvious to us that these parts had been modified in an area that wasn't approved,' Sawyer said. 'This is a consistent penalty with what we went through last year. \u2026 We felt like to keep the garage on a level playing field and the competition level where it needs to be, all the dialogue that went around this car last year, working with the owners on what the deterrent model should be, we were put in a position where we felt there was no other way but to write a penalty.'\nAsked if the modifications could impact downforce, Sawyer said: 'We don't normally get into the intent, but I think it's fair to say \u2026 could be performance around these modifications.'\nIn its statement earlier this week, Hendrick Motorsports cited 'documented inconsistent and unclear communication by the sanctioning body specifically related to louvers.'\nAsked to clarify those communications, Knaus said: 'We submitted a part through (Chevrolet) to NASCAR and then NASCAR chose the single-source provider for those components.\n'The components haven't been coming the way we expected them to be for a couple of the (manufacturers) as far as I know in the garage and definitely all of the Chevrolet teams, so we started to have dialogue with them (NASCAR) in early February about those problems.\n'It was us through our aerodynamic department, through (Chevrolet), back through NASCAR, back to us and back to (Chevrolet). There's a significant amount of communication that has been had. It's definitely confusing. The timelines are curious but they are there.'\nKnaus said that Hendrick Motorsports typically goes through a voluntary inspection at the track after going through the mandatory engine inspection and mandatory safety inspection shortly after the garage opens for the race weekend. That's what the Hendrick cars did at Phoenix on March 10.\nKnaus said that the Hendrick cars often go through the voluntary inspection 'so NASCAR has the opportunity to say, \u2018Hey, we don't like this' or \u2018Maybe you need to tweak that' or whatever it may be. That's been pretty much the standard cadence.'\nHendrick Motorsports stated this week that the louvers were not taken until four hours after going through that voluntary inspection. Knaus said he did not know why NASCAR did not do something immediately.\n'It's really confusing,' Knaus said. 'We knew that there was some attention to that area when we first went through technical inspection. That's what is really disappointing to me, quite honestly, is that we had plenty of time to get the parts off the car if we felt something was wrong.\n'I can assure you if we knew there was going to be a four-hour lag and we thought there was something wrong, they would have been in a trash can being burned with fuel somewhere so nobody would ever see them. We had no idea that we were going to be sitting in this position. Really disappointed that we are in the position that we are right now.'\nAsked if he felt the parts were faulty or that Hendrick modified the parts that they thought was acceptable to NASCAR, Knaus said: 'We've got a brand new set of these parts that we can go pull off of the shelf right now that NASCAR deemed illegal and inappropriate for us to race.'\nKnaus said that the team was not aware of a date for its appeal.\nAtlanta Xfinity starting lineup: Sammy Smith on pole Atlanta Truck starting lineup: Zane Smith on pole Saturday Atlanta Xfinity race: Start time, TV info, weather\nChad Knaus raises questions about NASCAR penalty to Hendrick Motorsports originally appeared on NBCSports.com",

You are not alone.\nAccording to YouMail's Robocall Index, the volume of calls nationwide jumped 5.7 percent in January over the previous month's numbers. YouMail, a free voicemail and spam blocking app, extrapolates its data from 'robocall traffic attempting to get through to YouMail's millions of active users.'\nThe largest metropolises such as Atlanta, Dallas, Chicago, Houston and New York received the most calls in January, according to YouMail estimates, which would make sense considering the sheer number of mobile phones owned by residents. Adjusted for per capita numbers, however, a new set of cities appear:\nBaton Rouge, LA (45.0 per capita)\nMemphis, TN (39.5)\nWashington D.C. (32.8)\nLittle Rock, AR (32.4)\nMacon, GA (31.6)\nBirmingham, AL (31)\nAlbany, GA (30.7)\nLafayette, LA (30.4)\nSan Antonio, TX (30)\nCharleston, SC (28.5)\nFrom fake debt collectors to phony vacation gifts, Baton Rouge residents have been targeted by scammers at an extraordinary rate for some time now.\n'I have 54 blocked numbers in my phone \u2026 and it's programmed to silence calls that aren't in my contacts or that I have not called,' former marketing consultant and Baton Rouge resident Melinda Walsh told CNN in 2021, yet the calls kept coming.\nA YouMail spokesperson told Nexstar that the Louisiana city has been at or near the top of the list when it comes to estimated robocalls per capita since they started compiling data roughly five years ago.\nThe spokesperson pointed to two possible explanations for the flood of calls to Baton Rouge residents: call center data shows people in the South tend to answer their phones more, leading to more robocalls, and crooks like to prey on vulnerable residents in areas with higher levels of economic hardship, like Baton Rouge, where the poverty rate is nearly 25 percent.\n'Scammers are measuring success metrics just like any good business,' Kush Parikh, president of Hiya, a Seattle-based company that helps users identify incoming calls, told CNN. 'Higher answer rates typically result in higher success for scammers.'\nAs for the total amount of estimated calls by state, these are the top 10 so far in 2023:\nTexas (533,885,600)\nCalifornia (396,258,400)\nFlorida (359,991,400)\nGeorgia (282,090,800)\nNew York (234,991,400)\nIllinois (182,366,000)\nNorth Carolina (176,395,700)\nPennsylvania (169,838,000)\nOhio (163,593,600)\nTenessee (145,072,600)\nIn January alone, all states in the top 10 saw an increase over December's numbers, but some states were especially inundated. Tennessee saw an eight percent increase while Pennsylvania's total jumped by 10 percent, according to YouMail estimates.\n\nYou may be familiar with the car warranty scam call, but another robocall \u2013 a fake Camp Lejeune compensation campaign \u2013 was the most common in January, marking its fourth straight month in the top spot, according to YouMail.\nIn August 2022, President Biden signed a law allowing people exposed to toxic water at the base to file lawsuits.\n\nAccording to YouMail, the calls can vary in their approach with the voice on the other end of the line claiming to be from various organizations such as the 'Plaintiff Advocate' or 'Class Action Claims,' but all purport to offer an avenue to medical compensation.\nThe Federal Communications Commission said that unwanted calls \u2013 including illegal and spoofed robocalls \u2013 are the top consumer complaint.\nHere are some tips to help with unwanted robocalls from the FCC:\nRegister your number on the\u00a0Do Not Call List. Legitimate telemarketers consult the list to avoid calling both landline and wireless phone numbers on the list.\nDon't answer calls from unknown numbers. If you answer such a call, hang up immediately.\nYou may not be able to tell right away if an incoming call is spoofed. Be aware: Caller ID showing a 'local' number does not necessarily mean it is a local caller.\nIf you answer the phone and the caller \u2013 or a recording \u2013 asks you to hit a button to stop getting the calls, you should just hang up. Scammers often use this trick to identify potential targets.\nDo not respond to any questions, especially those that can be answered with 'Yes.'\nNever give out personal information such as account numbers, Social Security numbers, mother's maiden names, passwords or other identifying information in response to unexpected calls or if you are at all suspicious.\nIf you get an inquiry from someone who says they represent a company or a government agency, hang up and call the phone number on your account statement, in the phone book, or on the company's or government agency's website to verify the authenticity of the request. You will usually get a written statement in the mail before you get a phone call from a legitimate source, particularly if the caller is asking for a payment.\nUse caution if you are being pressured for information immediately.\n\nIt is also important to remember that scammers can use a robotext as well. The FCC said that rules ban text messages sent to a mobile phone using an autodialer unless you previously gave consent to receive the message, or the message is sent for emergency purposes.",

In a report obtained by the outlet, police said the side door was open, loose change littered the floor and a half-cooked hamburger was still on the counter.\n'It was evident that everyone had left the restaurant in a hurry,' officers wrote, according to the newspaper.\nAuthorities said Wade showed up to work after hours and asked the manager to cook him a burger because he was hungry, WRGA reported, citing the police report.\nAs the manager went to make his order, police said Wade let the accused robbers in through a back door. The men, who were armed, threatened the manager at gunpoint and got away with nearly $3,500, WSB-TV reported, citing police.\nThe manager told police the robbers also demanded the restaurant's security tapes. He instead handed them four electronic boxes used to control the food displays, according to the news station.\nThe men left the restaurant on foot while Wade hopped in a dark-colored car a short time later, The Rome News-Tribune reported, citing police. Much of the incident was caught on video surveillance, which showed the employee talking to the two men at the back door minutes before the robbery.\nWade was booked into the Floyd County Jail where he remained held without bond as of March 9, online records show.\nRome is about 70 miles northwest of downtown Atlanta.\n\n65-year-old robs a bank of $1 and asks to go to prison, Utah cops say. \u2018Thank you'",

    "summary": "Reese Witherspoon and former CAA agent Jim Toth announced on Friday that they will be divorcing after nearly 12 years of marriage.\nIn a joint statement posted to Instagram, Witherspoon and Toth wrote: 'It is with a great deal of care and consideration that we have made the difficult decision to divorce. We have enjoyed so many wonderful years together and are moving forward with deep love, kindness and mutual respect for everything we have created together. Our biggest priority is our son and our entire family as we navigate this next chapter. These matters are never easy and are extremely personal. We truly appreciate everyone's respect for our family's privacy at this time.'\n\n\n\n\nThe two wed in March 2011 and were set to celebrate their 12-year anniversary on Sunday. They share a 10-year-old son, Tennessee James. Witherspoon also has two children from her previous marriage to Ryan Phillippe, Ava and Deacon.\nWitherspoon and Toth met while he was a talent agent at Creative Artists Agency, where Witherspoon is a client. In 2019, he left the agency to join now defunct streamer Quibi.\nThough Witherspoon and Toth kept their relationship fairly private, the couple was embroiled in a scandal in 2013 when they were arrested and briefly jailed in Atlanta, Ga. after Toth was pulled over under suspicion of driving while intoxicated. Toth faced a DUI charge, while Witherspoon was arrested on disorderly conduct. She pleaded no-contest and was required to pay court charges, while Toth pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor DUI and was ordered to complete community service and an alcohol education program in addition to paying a fine.\nIn recent years, Witherspoon has become one of the most sought-after producers via her banner Hello Sunshine, which has produced acclaimed films and TV series including 'Gone Girl,' 'Big Little Lies,' 'The Morning Show,' 'Daisy Jones & the Six' and the Witherspoon and Ashton Kutcher rom-com 'Your Place or Mine.' In 2021, Witherspoon sold part of the company to Kevin A. Mayer and Tom Staggs' Blackstone-backed Candle Media for $900 million.\nBest of Variety\n\n\n\nSign up for Variety's Newsletter.

    "summary": "LAWRENCEVILLE, GA - (NewMediaWire) - February 16, 2023 - via QC Kinetix - QC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) uses minimally-invasive therapies to fasten the body's natural abilities for pain and inflammation relief.Physical pain is a common occurrence that happens to most people at one point in their life. Most pains are treated easily and do not require advanced medical solutions. However, persistent severe pain is a cause for alarm and may lead to a recommendation for surgery or prescription of potentially addictive pain meds. People often shy away from invasive procedures due to their long recovery periods and high costs. Surgery does not also guarantee that patients will have a pain-free life. Fortunately, the emergence of new technologies and evidenced research has discovered minimally-invasive regenerative medicine procedures that can provide pain relief in place of surgeries.QC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) is one of the leading clinics offering reliable regenerative medicine therapies tailored to patients' unique health needs. The clinic uses these treatments to naturally relieve symptoms like inflammation, stiffness, cramping, noisy joints, redness, and warmth. They do not recommend surgery or prescription pain meds. Instead, they use minimally-invasive therapies to fasten the body's natural healing abilities. This allows the body to restore its injured parts much faster than normal. The therapies do not introduce foreign objects into the body. Because of the fastened restoration rate, they barely have any downtime, so patients don't have to take time off work, exercise, or personal activities. The therapies will speed up the recovery of the injured part and strengthen it to avoid a recurrence of the same condition. The clinic targets symptoms caused by injuries, accidents, musculoskeletal conditions, and degenerative diseases like arthritis. QC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) understands that not all patients can benefit from natural biologic therapies. They have set up a free consultation session that diagnoses patients' conditions and informs them of their eligibility for regenerative medicine. A consultation takes about 30 to 60 minutes, and patients get to meet with one of the clinic's physicians to discuss their medical history and perform additional tests in some instances to improve accuracy. If eligible, the physician will create a customized treatment plan for them and explain what each recommended therapy entails. A quote from the clinic's website stated this about their services, \"With our non-surgical biologic therapies, your pain will diminish quickly. Our treatments will also save you from the invasiveness of surgery and the side effects of long-term usage of prescription drugs.\"QC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) offers solutions to patients with difficulty accomplishing everyday tasks like standing, sitting, and walking. They also assist patients who have tried conventional medicine solutions but have not experienced relief. In such dire cases, the clinic provides a full recovery regime that combines regenerative medicine with traditional medical solutions, rest, and bracing for the best possible results. They offer Lawrenceville back pain treatment and track the progress of the treatments to ensure they are working as expected. The physician educates patients on exercises they can use at home to enhance re.The Lawrenceville regenerative medicine clinic offers Concierge Medicine which is logistical support for patients' comfort when receiving treatment. They have a modern facility with a spa-like environment where patients are welcomed by friendly, supportive staff. The clinic provides refreshments among other logistical support, allowing patients to focus fully on their recovery journey. The clinic values and welcomes patient engagement and incorporates patient feedback on the therapies they receive in the treatment plan for improved patient outcomes. QC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) uses regenerative medicine in sports medicine to relieve the symptoms of mild or severe sports injuries. They intervene when traditional sports injury treatments like elevation, ice, and compression have failed.

Most pains are treated easily and do not require advanced medical solutions. However, persistent severe pain is a cause for alarm and may lead to a recommendation for surgery or prescription of potentially addictive pain meds.\nPeople often shy away from invasive procedures due to their long recovery periods and high costs. Surgery does not also guarantee that patients will have a pain-free life. Fortunately, the emergence of new technologies and evidenced research has discovered minimally-invasive regenerative medicine procedures that can provide pain relief in place of surgeries.\nQC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) is one of the leading clinics offering reliable regenerative medicine therapies tailored to patients' unique health needs. The clinic uses these treatments to naturally relieve symptoms like inflammation, stiffness, cramping, noisy joints, redness, and warmth. They do not recommend surgery or prescription pain meds. Instead, they use minimally-invasive therapies to fasten the body's natural healing abilities. This allows the body to restore its injured parts much faster than normal.\nThe therapies do not introduce foreign objects into the body. Because of the fastened restoration rate, they barely have any downtime, so patients don't have to take time off work, exercise, or personal activities. The therapies will speed up the recovery of the injured part and strengthen it to avoid a recurrence of the same condition. The clinic targets symptoms caused by injuries, accidents, musculoskeletal conditions, and degenerative diseases like arthritis.\nQC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) understands that not all patients can benefit from natural biologic therapies. They have set up a free consultation session that diagnoses patients' conditions and informs them of their eligibility for regenerative medicine. A consultation takes about 30 to 60 minutes, and patients get to meet with one of the clinic's physicians to discuss their medical history and perform additional tests in some instances to improve accuracy. If eligible, the physician will create a customized treatment plan for them and explain what each recommended therapy entails.\nA quote from the clinic's website stated this about their services,\n\"With our non-surgical biologic therapies, your pain will diminish quickly. Our treatments will also save you from the invasiveness of surgery and the side effects of long-term usage of prescription drugs.\"\nQC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) offers solutions to patients with difficulty accomplishing everyday tasks like standing, sitting, and walking. They also assist patients who have tried conventional medicine solutions but have not experienced relief. In such dire cases, the clinic provides a full recovery regime that combines regenerative medicine with traditional medical solutions, rest, and bracing for the best possible results. They offer Lawrenceville back pain treatment and track the progress of the treatments to ensure they are working as expected. The physician educates patients on exercises they can use at home to enhance re.\nThe Lawrenceville regenerative medicine clinic offers Concierge Medicine which is logistical support for patients' comfort when receiving treatment. They have a modern facility with a spa-like environment where patients are welcomed by friendly, supportive staff. The clinic provides refreshments among other logistical support, allowing patients to focus fully on their recovery journey. The clinic values and welcomes patient engagement and incorporates patient feedback on the therapies they receive in the treatment plan for improved patient outcomes.\nQC Kinetix (Lawrenceville) uses regenerative medicine in sports medicine to relieve the symptoms of mild or severe sports injuries. They intervene when traditional sports injury treatments like elevation, ice, and compression have failed. The clinic has partnered with athletes like Emmitt Smith, among the thousands of patients who have benefited from their natural sports medicine therapies.\nFor consultation and booking, contact their staff by calling (770) 285-8026.

    "summary": "By Jeff Mason\nWILMINGTON, Delaware (Reuters) - President Joe Biden will press his case for stronger voting rights during a visit to Alabama on Sunday to commemorate the 58th anniversary of \"Bloody Sunday,\" when state troopers beat peaceful protesters who were marching against discrimination.\nBiden's trip to Selma is his latest event aimed at underscoring his commitment to Black voters, who helped propel him to the White House and remain a key constituency going into his expected 2024 re-election bid.\nIt also is happening with Biden's efforts to pass voting rights legislation stalled in Congress.\nThe president will speak at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, where state troopers clubbed and used tear gas against the 1965 voting rights marchers, including John Lewis, a Black civil rights activist who went on to become a U.S. congressman.\nCoverage of the brutality shocked the nation and helped spark the 1965 Voting Rights Act.\n\"President Biden will talk about the importance of commemorating Bloody Sunday so that history cannot be erased,\" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Friday. \"He will highlight how the continued fight for voting rights is ... integral to delivering economic justice and civil rights for Black Americans.\"\nBiden has sought to build support for the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, bills that would make Election Day a holiday, register new voters and strengthen U.S. Justice Department oversight of local election jurisdictions with a history of discrimination.\nRepublicans, who control the U.S. House of Representatives, oppose the measures.\nThe president, who has said he intends to run for re-election, has sought to buttress his support from African American voters. Last month the Democratic National Committee approved a shakeup of the party's 2024 primary calendar, making South Carolina - a state with a high percentage of Black voters - first in line for holding its presidential nominating contest, displacing Iowa.\nIn January, Biden spoke at the Atlanta church of slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.\nBiden's visit to Selma follows Vice President Kamala Harris's trip there last year for the anniversary of the march. Then-President Barack Obama spoke at the 50th anniversary of the march in 2015 and walked across the bridge with his wife, Michelle, and Republican former President George W. Bush and his wife, Laura.\n(Reporting by Jeff Mason; Editing by Paul Simao)",

    "excerpt": "'You're fixing to see a change in this country,' state Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, said shortly before House lawmakers unanimously passed their EV bill. 'This is to get us prepared for the future.'",
    "summary": "As the state prepares to build a network of electric vehicle charging stations across Georgia, the General Assembly is grappling with how they should be operated and how to tax the electricity they sell to EV owners.\nSeparate bills making their way through the Georgia House and Senate would go a long way toward setting the stage for ending the era of the internal combustion engine and bringing on a new generation of EVs.\n'You're fixing to see a change in this country,' state Rep. Alan Powell, R-Hartwell, said March 1 shortly before House lawmakers unanimously passed their EV bill. 'This is to get us prepared for the future.'\nHouse Bill 406, and a Senate EV bill that cleared that chamber's Regulated Industries Committee the same day, would end the practice of EV owners paying to charge their vehicles based on the time it takes. Instead, they would be charged by the kilowatt-hour.\nThat's the most important part of the two bills, said Anne Blair, Atlanta-based senior director of policy for the Washington, D.C.-headquartered Electrification Coalition, a nonpartisan nonprofit working to facilitate the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.\n'It will be needed to qualify for federal funding,' she said.\nThe Georgia Department of Transportation (DOT) is planning to jumpstart the rollout of a network of EV charging stations across the state with $135 million in federal funding through the bipartisan infrastructure bill Congress passed two years ago.\nMany of those charging stations likely will be located at convenience stores that already sell gasoline and will transition a portion of their operations to charging electric vehicles.\n'Many of them are very interested in getting into the market and selling whatever fuel source is predominant,' Blair said.\nAs more Georgians switch to EVs and get rid of their gasoline-powered cars and trucks, the state will lose a sizable portion of the gas tax revenue the DOT uses to build, repair and maintain roads and bridges. That approaching loss of revenue is behind another key element in both the House and Senate EV bills.\nEV owners already pay a flat annual fee of $210 to the state. The two EV bills would add to that by levying a sales tax on EV owners who use the new charging stations as well as a separate excise tax.\n'The goal is to make sure as we move from carbon-based fuel to electric, we maintain our funding,' Rep. Rick Jasperse, R-Jasper, chief sponsor of the House EV bill, said during a committee hearing last month. 'We have to make sure everybody pays their fair share.'",

The list of structures runs the gamut, from unique, artistic designs to sterile government buildings.\nComing it at 28th on the list is South Carolina's ugliest building, the Holiday Inn Charleston-Riverview in Charleston.\nWhile the design and location does grant many visitors great views of Charleston and the Ashley River, the look of the building itself leaves much to be desired, the website notes.\n'\u2026 the building itself is a real eyesore \u2014 unless you want to feel like you're vacationing in a prison tower,' the website writes.\nBuilt in 1971, the building is also getting up there in age. Some recent Yelp reviews complain about the aging of the building and the rooms.\nRead Edward W.'s review of Holiday Inn Charleston-Riverview on Yelp\nAccording to the Holiday Inn's website, the 14-story hotel does offer several amenities, such as an outdoor pool, a 1,200 square-foot meeting room, executive board room, a newly renovated fitness center and a 24-hour business center.\nMeanwhile, nearby states of North Carolina and Georgia fared better on the list. The Biltmore Building in Asheville, NC, ranked 41st, while the Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, GA ranked 42nd on the list of ugliest buildings.\nThe travel site states that the Biltmore Estate is not hideous on its own, but more that its existence makes no sense within the context of North Carolina.\n'This castle seems like it would be more at home in the Old Country as opposed to the Old South,' the website states.\nThe Mercedes-Benz Stadium officially opened in 2017 to replace the Georgia Dome.\n'The unusual roof is retractable, which might help to explain why it looks so strange, but that doesn't make it any easier to look at,' the website reads.\nBut what does the website consider to be the ugliest building in the U.S.?\nThat ignominious honor goes to the Dick Cheney Federal Building in Casper, WY.\nThe federal building was named after former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was also a state representative for Wyoming earlier in his political career. The building was renamed for Cheney long after being built in 1970.\nTo see the full list of ugliest buildings in each state, click here.",

Dover turned with the year with nods as a Pandora 2023 Artist to Watch, an Amazon Music 2023 Breakthrough Artist to Watch: Country Class and a member of CMT's Listen Up 2023 Class.\n'It feels incredible to finally be able to share \u2018Giving Up On That' with the world,' says Dover. 'I performed it during my Grand Ole Opry debut, and for it to be my first official single with Mercury Records makes this song even more special to me.'\nDover wrote the song with Adam Craig and Josh Pierce. 'I hope everyone can relate to it,' he goes on, 'as we've all had those relationships where we regret not bringing our best selves to the table until it's too late, and I hope it finds the folks that need to hear it most.'\nDover will travel to London next month to make his international debut at CMA's Songwriters Series, the opening event of the 2023 Country to Country Festival. He then joins Chase Rice on the Way Down Yonder Tour in the US in April.

Dover has also signed with Sony Music Publishing in partnership with Droptine Music Publishing, and with United Talent Agency.\nAfter his selection as a Spotify 2022 Artist to Watch, Dover released 'Hear About A Girl,' about which Billboard noted: 'Dover's voice is both intimate and commanding on this track.'

His next release, 'Damn Good Life,' prompted The Boot to write: 'Dover is savoring every moment in his uplifting new single,' while Country Now added: 'Between the optimistic narrative that Dover delivers through his crisp vocals and the carefree tune highlighted by the impressive guitar strum, nothing but a good time can be had when this song comes through the speakers.'\nBuy or stream Dalton Dover's 'Giving Up On That.'\nFor the latest music news and exclusive features, check out uDiscover Music.\nuDiscover Music is operated by Universal Music Group (UMG).

There were no injuries.\"\nMusic was in the Glynn County Detention Center Monday on charges of willful obstruction of officers, two counts of fleeing and attempting to elude police, reckless driving, several traffic infractions associated with the chase, and parole violation.\nIt was the parole violation that allegedly prompted Music's first escape from police just days prior. A Glynn County Police report said an officer made contact with Music at a gas station after someone called to say they had found him after he had been reported missing. GCPD posted on Facebook Jan. 27 seeking the public's help in finding Music as part of a missing person case.\nWhen the officer ran Music's name through a statewide database on Thursday, he learned Music was wanted on a parole violation associated with a fraud case out of Atlanta, the report said.\nMusic on that day refused to get out of the car and allegedly ran from county police, saying, \"I can't go back to prison,\" according to the report.\nMusic was able to get away that day after officers backed off of chasing him in accordance with the department's pursuit directive because specific criteria were not met to allow officers to chase him, the report said.\nMusic was initially reported missing by family members on Dec. 23, 2022 when he failed to show up for work and turned off his cellphone, police said in the Facebook post.",

    "summary": "Collaboration will Meet Growing Liquid Hydrogen Demand for Clean Energy Transition\nTITUSVILLE, Fla. and ATLANTA, March 08, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- GenH2, an industry leader in hydrogen infrastructure solutions, and Chart Industries (NYSE: GTLS) ('Chart'), a leading global engineering design and manufacturer of highly engineered equipment servicing multiple applications in the clean energy and industrial gas markets, have formed a strategic partnership to jointly market and distribute small-scale hydrogen liquefaction technologies globally. Included in the agreement are collaboration on global sales and marketing opportunities, equipment manufacturing and supply, and the deployment of GenH2's 1,000 kg/day hydrogen liquefier.\nDemand for distributed hydrogen infrastructure has grown significantly and the supply of liquid hydrogen remains low or non-existent in some geographies. GenH2's 1000 Kg/day solution will allow for the deployment of a scalable, modular distributed infrastructure that breaks geographic constraints.\nAccording to the details of the MOU, GenH2 will incorporate Chart equipment into their liquefaction systems, inclusive of storage, heat exchangers, and other key components.\u00a0\u00a0 In addition to its global footprint, Chart also has 60 years of experience manufacturing hydrogen equipment that leads the industry in performance and quality. 'In a market where supply chain concerns are rampant, this strategic partnership will allow us to meet our growing order list,' said Greg Gosnell, President, and CEO of GenH2.\nThe GenH2 flagship 1 TPD liquefaction system offers 1,000 kg/day of pure para hydrogen using technology that is optimized for performance and efficiency. The small footprint of the system was intended to be deployed at the point of demand, providing the user with flexibility and control over their energy source. This partners well as a complement to Chart's larger H2 liquefaction capabilities, and allows Chart to focus on expanding larger-scale solutions and GenH2 to focus on small distributed liquefaction systems.\nAdditionally, the two companies will collaborate to continue to develop industry relationships across the full hydrogen value chain as well as pursue new customers where opportunities exist. Gosnell added, 'Our new partnership with Chart will allow GenH2 to accelerate its market expansion plans into new territories. '\n'Partnering with GenH2 on technology and equipment is a positive for the industry in furthering hydrogen liquefaction options of all scales and for a variety of applications,' stated Jill Evanko, Chart's CEO.\u00a0 'We are excited to collaborate with GenH2 to bring these innovative solutions to market in a safe and efficient manner.'\nThe agreement follows GenH2's recent introduction of its GenH2 LS20 Mobile Liquid Hydrogen System, an end-to-end liquefication system that functions both as a stationary unit, or on a trailer for mobile use. As a complete system, the LS20 can liquefy, store, and dispense liquid hydrogen.\nFor more information, please visit www.DiscoverHydrogen.com.\nAbout GenH2GenH2\u00a0is a technology leader in hydrogen infrastructure systems for advanced clean energy.

Earmarked for family support services, this year's annual donation will help address patient mental and emotional well-being throughout 2023 and brings Aflac's funding support of the pediatric cancer and blood disorders cause to over $166 million since 1995.\n\"Aflac continues to provide funding for treatment and research, but we also understand that children need more than medicine when going through a medical crisis,\" said Kathelen Amos, president of The Aflac Foundation Inc. \"For every child with a cancer or blood disorder diagnosis, there is a family in crisis. The needs and concerns of the parents and siblings include, but are not limited to, those directly concerning the patient. We are pleased to help fund the ever-increasing array of holistic and support services that Children's offers to the patients and families of the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.\"\nAflac's donation will help fund the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center's 35-person Family Support Team, which includes social workers, child life specialists, non-denominational chaplains and music therapists who work in tandem with medical staff to provide therapeutic activities, positive distractions and social support for both patients and families. Major medical insurance does not typically cover family support services, leaving hospitals dependent on philanthropic support to continue the program that cost the Aflac Cancer and Blood Disorders Center $2.5 million in 2021. In the same year, Family Support Team members provided services to a majority of the more than 8,000 children receiving care at the Center, many giving support to their families, as well.\n\"Because a diagnosis of cancer or a blood disorder impacts all aspects of family life, the common goal of the specialists, therapists and volunteers that make up the Family Support Team is to ensure that the family feels cared for and supported as they adjust and cope, every step of the way,\" said Certified Child Life Specialist Lucy Tyler, the Center's lead Child Life Specialist in Outpatient Oncology. \"We concentrate on the emotional and mental aspects of a childhood illness that, if left unaddressed, can have long-term negative effects on a child and his or her family.\"\nAccording to Tyler, across different roles, the support team offers distraction and fun through art and music, helps with schoolwork, explains medical procedures in terms a child can understand, provides a safe space to show anger or frustration, helps parents navigate and find financial resources, and more.\nThe latest donation by The Aflac Foundation Inc. further strengthens the company's commitment to help support psychosocial needs of children with cancer and blood disorders such as sickle cell in addition to providing funding for treatment and research.\nIn 2018, after nearly two years of research with health care professionals and families, Aflac introduced My Special Aflac Duck\u00ae, the award-winning robotic companion and app designed to help patients communicate their emotions with caregivers, teach them about their treatment through medical play, provide distraction and fun with music and art, reinforce comfort and coping skills, and more.\nTo date, the company has given, free-of-charge, more than 22,000 My Special Aflac Ducks to children with cancer and sickle cell across the United States, Japan and Northern Ireland at a cost of more than $3.5 million to the company.\nFor more information about Aflac's commitment to children with cancer and blood disorders, including how they can receive My Special Aflac Duck free of charge, visit AflacChildhoodCancer.org.

    "summary": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Damon Stoudamire managed to get one word out \u2014 'Wow!' \u2014 before he was overcome with emotion.\nThe longtime NBA guard is thrilled to be back in the college game, heading a men's basketball program that he thinks can once again be a national powerhouse.\nThen again, Stoudamire is not the first coach at Georgia Tech to express such optimism.\nStoudamire was formally introduced as the Yellow Jackets' coach on Tuesday, capping a whirlwind search that took only three days after Josh Pastner was fired following another losing season.\n'This has been a long journey for me,' Stoudamire said, choking back tears. 'I'm excited beyond belief to be here.'\nStoudamire's only previous head coaching experience came at Pacific, a West Coast Conference school where he posted a 71-77 record over a five-year tenure. He never reached the postseason but was selected as the league's coach of the year in 2020.\nStoudamire has been a Boston Celtics assistant since 2021, working with a team that reached last year's NBA Finals and is among the top championship contenders this season.\nHe couldn't pass up the chance to coach at Georgia Tech, even though the Yellow Jackets haven't been much of a factor on the national scene for nearly two decades.\nStoudamire vowed to change the trajectory.\n'This is a tradition-rich program, and one that aspires to get back to winning championships,' he said. 'We're going to galvanize the community, the student body, and just get this thing going in the right direction.'\nPastner said many of the same things when he arrived in 2016, calling Georgia Tech a sleeping giant even as he faced a massive rebuilding job.\nHe talked confidently of luring top talent to the Atlantic Coast Conference school in midtown Atlanta, saying the urban setting would be a huge appeal \u2014 especially with many of the nation's top prospects coming out of Georgia Tech's own backyard.\nSeven years later, Pastner was out of a job, having managed only a single NCAA Tournament appearance \u2014 a one-and-done in 2021 after a surprising run to the ACC championship \u2014 while drawing scant interest from five-star recruits.\nPastner's predecessor, Brian Gregory, lasted only five forgettable seasons before he was dumped. Even Paul Hewitt, who guided the Yellow Jackets to the national championship game in 2004, oversaw a program in decline.\nGeorgia Tech managed only two winning seasons and two NCAA appearances over Hewitt's final six seasons, leading to his firing in 2011.\nIn total, the Yellow Jackets have managed only three NCAA appearances and one victory in the Big Dance in the past 18 seasons. Even more stunning, they've had just two winning records in the ACC over that span, both posted by Pastner.\nIt's a far cry from the powerhouse program built by Bobby Cremins in the 1980s and '90s.\nStoudamire said he was very familiar with that team growing up. He ripped off the names of Cremins' top players, including Mark Price, Bruce Dalrymple, Duane Ferrell, Tom Hammond, Dennis Scott, Kenny Anderson, Brian Oliver, James Forrest and Malcolm Mackey.\nFlanked by Georgia Tech President Angel Cabrera and athletic director J Batt, Stoudamire said confidently, 'With the shared vision we have, I don't think there's nothing we can't do.'\nThe new coach was short on specifics. He vaguely talked about being a program that will rely heavily on analytics, plans to beef up recruiting in both Georgia and around the nation, and can be a much bigger player on the NIL market with all the opportunities available in metro Atlanta.\nStoudamire stressed that he's not looking to recreate the program Cremins built, but did say he might take from the former coach's playbook. Those teams were long known for having some of the nation's top point guards, from Price to Anderson to Stephon Marbury.\n'I do feel that guards win championships,' said the 49-year-old Stoudamire, a guard who starred at Arizona and went on to a 13-year career in the NBA. 'Good guards will win you many games.'\nFor Georgia Tech, the hiring of Stoudamire capped a six-month period of enormous change for an athletic program that has struggled in its two biggest sports.\nEarly last season, football coach Geoff Collins and athletic director Todd Stansbury were both fired. Batt replaced Stansbury and wound up keeping interim football coach Brent Key as the ultimate replacement.\nThen, shortly after Pastner's team completed a 15-18 season, including a 6-12 mark in the ACC, Batt decided to make another major coaching change.\n'At the end of the day, the people we surround ourselves with is the most important part of our work,' Batt said. 'I have extreme confidence in both of these hires we've made in my short time here, and I feel really great about our future.'\nStoudamire was asked if there was any hesitation to leave the Celtics, especially with the playoffs and another championship run right around the corner.\n'When Boston wins the championship,' he said confidently, \"I'll still get my ring. We've already talked about that. I'll get my ring.\"\nThen he plans on winning a few more at Georgia Tech.\n___\nAP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",

    "summary": "This story was originally published by Grist. You can subscribe to its weekly newsletter here.\nA burst of gunfire rang through a forest on the edge of Atlanta, Georgia, on the morning of January 18. Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n, whose chosen name was Tortuguita (Spanish for 'little turtle'), had been shot and killed by police officers, becoming the only known person killed by law enforcement during an environmentalist act of land defense in the U.S.\nRead more\nThese Winning Close-Up Photos Show Life That's Often Overlooked\nRemembering Enterprise: The Test Shuttle That Never Flew to Space\nApple's 12 Most Embarrassing Product Failures\nTortuguita was part of a loose-knit group continuously occupying the woods to stop trees from being felled by construction of a sprawling police training center known to activists as Cop City. In 2021, with little public input, the Atlanta city council approved plans for the $90 million Public Safety Training Center on the city-owned former site of Atlanta's prison farm, which the trees had reclaimed and had previously been included in plans for a revamped parks system. (The activists call the area the Weelaunee Forest, a name from the Muscogee people who were violently forced out of the area 200 years ago.)\nAlthough some members of the transient and leaderless group had damaged property in apparent attempts to stymie construction, many just camped, hoping their refusal to move out of the way of the trees would prevent them from being cut down and replaced by firing ranges and a mock city where police would conduct riot training.\nThat morning, members of a multi-agency law enforcement task force had moved through the woods toward Tortuguita's tent. According to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation, Tortuguita fired first, using a handgun the 26-year-old had purchased, and struck a Georgia State Patrol officer, who was hospitalized. No civilians appear to have witnessed what happened, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation says no body cameras captured the incident. In life, Tortuguita spoke often (and publicly) of the virtues of nonviolence, so their friends and fellow activists doubt the state's story.\n'We have no reason whatsoever to trust the narrative that's been given,' said Kamau Franklin, founder of the local group Community Movement Builders, which organizes with Black communities in Atlanta and opposes the police training center, citing other high-profile police killings around the country in which official narratives have fallen apart.\nWhile the environmental nonprofit Global Witness has documented over 1,700 killings of land defenders worldwide over the past decade, Tortuguita's death is only the second such killing in the U.S. The first was a fisheries observer who disappeared at sea under circumstances that suggested foul play in 2015.\nOn Thursday, Governor Brian Kemp declared a state of emergency in response to protests Saturday night sparked by Tortuguita's death, during which participants threw rocks, broke windows, and burned a police car. Kemp's order, effective until February 9, allows up to 1,000 National Guard troops to police the streets of Atlanta.\nTo allies, Tortuguita's killing was the climax of an escalation of police and legal tactics meant to stifle the wide-ranging movement to stop construction of the training center, which includes parks advocates, prison abolitionists, and area neighborhood associations. Over the course of December and January, 19 opponents of the police training center have been charged with felonies under Georgia's rarely used 2017 domestic terrorism law. But Grist's review of 20 arrest warrants shows that none of those arrested and slapped with terrorism charges are accused of seriously injuring anyone. Nine are alleged to have committed no specific illegal actions beyond misdemeanor trespassing. Instead, their mere association with a group committed to defending the forest appears to be the foundation for declaring them terrorists. Officials have underlined that an investigation is ongoing, and charges could yet be added or removed.\nRead Next\nThe best way to save forests? Legally recognize Indigenous lands.\nEvery two days, a land defender is killed. Most are Indigenous.\nClimate activists' new, confrontational tactics aren't popular. That's kind of the point.\nLauren Regan, an attorney who is the executive director of the Civil Liberties Defense Center, which will represent some defendants, said the charges are legally flimsy and designed to scare movement supporters.\n'It's so next time a vigil happens, mom or the school teacher or the nurse \u2014 or someone that has higher risk of randomly getting arrested \u2014 is probably going to think twice about going,' she said.\n'They're going to use this to continually vilify and criminalize the wider movement,' added Franklin.\nGeorgia's terror law passed in response to high-profile mass shootings including the 2015 massacre of nine Black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, by white supremacist Dylann Roof. The 2017 law expanded the definition of 'domestic terrorism' from its original designation as an act intended to kill or injure at least 10 people to one encompassing a range of property crimes. Critics at the time, including the Georgia chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union, argued that the law was bound to be used against protesters and to stifle free speech. The charges validate civil liberties' groups concerns and offer a warning signal for lawmakers in both major parties who have repeatedly proposed federal domestic terrorism legislation as a solution to America's epidemic of mass murder.\nAtlanta Police Department spokesperson John Chafee, on the other hand, defended the use of the law in this case. 'We are hopeful the law and the possibility of being charged with this felony will be a deterrent from engaging in criminal behavior,' he told Grist. 'We support the right to protest and we will work to ensure those engaged in a lawful protest are able to do so safely.'\nElsewhere in the woods on the day of the shooting, officers tore down 25 campsites and arrested seven activists. Law enforcement also netted bystanders: One Dekalb County Police Department incident report describes two individuals walking along a river trail 'in an area that is being occupied by suspects wanted for domestic terrorism.' The Georgia Bureau of Investigation recommended they be 'placed in flex handcuffs and transported to the nearby command post.' Later, they were determined to be 'vagrants from the city of New Orleans' and were released.\nTimothy Murphy was one of the last forest defenders standing. In the predawn hours of January 19, S.W.A.T. team members shone spotlights on Murphy as the activist perched above a treehouse, according to an incident report. Around sunrise, Murphy rappelled down the tree. Dekalb County Police S.W.A.T. members grabbed their legs, cut their harness, and booked them on charges of domestic terrorism.\nSo far police don't claim that Murphy committed any act of violence or even property destruction. Key to Murphy's terror charge, according to their arrest warrant, is that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, designated a group called Defend the Atlanta Forest as 'Domestic Violent Extremists.' In other words, Murphy appears to have been charged with terrorism on the basis of their affiliation with the forest defenders.\nIn response to questions from Grist, a DHS spokesperson denied that the federal agency classifies any specific groups with this term, while also saying that it does use the term to refer to any U.S. individual or group 'who seeks to further social or political goals, wholly or in part, through unlawful acts of force or violence' and regularly shares information about threats with state and local agencies.\nRegardless, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation decided that Murphy was a member of the 'extremist' group on the basis of the activist's actions: They trespassed and then refused police orders to leave the treehouse for 12 hours. As a result, if prosecutors move forward with the terror charge, Murphy will face a mandatory minimum sentence of five to 35 years in prison for what's known as a tree sit \u2014 a common tactic among environmentalists.\nThe Atlanta forest defenders' warrants state that Defend the Atlanta Forest earned its Domestic Violent Extremist label because members had thrown Molotov cocktails, rocks, and fireworks at police, and also shot metal ball bearings at contractors. They had also committed various acts of property destruction, including vandalism, discharging firearms at 'critical infrastructure,' and committing arson of 'public buildings, heavy equipment, private buildings, and private vehicles.'\nHowever, besides three allegations of rock-throwing, the 14 forest defenders' warrants do not appear to accuse them of committing any of the above acts that led to the designation. Grist's analysis of arrest warrants found that, for nine forest defenders detained during police operations in December and January, their alleged acts of 'domestic terrorism' consist solely of trespassing in the woods and camping or occupying a tree house.\nA warrant following a police raid on December 13, for example, justifies a domestic terrorism charge by stating that the activist 'affirmed their cooperation with [Defend the Atlanta Forest] by occupying a tree house while wearing a gas mask and camouflage clothing.' Another defendant, arrested January 18, told police that they were aware of the Cop City controversy before coming to Atlanta and had planned in advance to sleep on the land \u2014 an admission that apparently became the basis for a domestic terrorism charge. 'Said defendant admitted to participating in previous protests in other states for environmental causes,' the warrant added.\nFour forest defenders charged with domestic terrorism are also accused of possessing incendiary devices or firearms or throwing rocks at fire department and emergency workers and damaging a police vehicle. One of those was charged separately with injuring an officer, who scraped and cut his knee and elbow as the defendant fled. A fifth defendant is separately accused of trying to cut the rope of an arborist attempting to remove them from a tree house.\nSix people charged with domestic terrorism during a night of protest in response to Tortuguita's killing on January 21, including one who was also charged in the woods, face a slightly different set of allegations. Their domestic terrorism arrest affidavits point to felony charges they face for allegedly damaging a nearby Atlanta Police Foundation building and setting fire to a police car. A separate set of arrest citations is ambiguous as to whether the defendants are known to have personally carried out property damage, though one defendant is charged with carrying spray paint, a hammer, torch fuel, and a lighter as well as kicking and spitting on an officer as they were arrested.\nThe initial arrest citations for domestic terrorism also state that members of the crowd 'used explosives/fireworks toward police,' without indicating whether the defendants did so themselves. The street protesters' domestic terrorism arrest affidavits state that the alleged felonies were carried out with the intention of intimidating officials into changing government policy.\nAll but one of the activists arrested in the forest were released on bonds ranging from $6,000 to $13,500. None of the street protesters have been released, with four dubbed flight risks and denied bond, and two unable to pay a $355,000 bond.\nThe forest defenders' charges appear to stand on shaky legal ground. To be convicted under Georgia's terror law, an individual must first commit or attempt a felony. Nine of those arrested in the forest are charged with criminal trespass, which is only a misdemeanor.\nAlso, the acts must be intended to intimidate people, use intimidation to influence government policy, or impact the government through the use of 'destructive devices, assassination, or kidnapping.' How trespassing and camping could constitute intimidation is unclear. The law does not contain language about whether associating with a 'Domestic Violent Extremist' group counts as terrorism.\nEven if the charges are dismissed on the grounds that they do not fulfill the requirements of the law, they may leave a lasting legacy. 'One of the problems with state repression is the crackdown and the arrests and the jailing and the bond \u2014 for the humans that are targeted, even if they end up being acquitted, all of that takes a toll,' said Regan, the attorney.\nAlthough multiple environmental activists have been prosecuted under federal terrorism law in recent years, it's been over a decade since the U.S. has seen anti-terrorism charges aimed at a broad swath of environmental activists. During a period known as the 'Green Scare' in the mid-2000s, more than a dozen people associated with the Earth Liberation Front and Animal Liberation Front were arrested as part of an FBI domestic terror operation. At the time, 'eco-terrorism' became the Justice Department's top domestic terrorism priority, despite the fact that those arrested had made a point to avoid causing any bodily harm even as they burned down facilities they considered environmentally destructive.\nThe smaller-scale green scare that police have carried out in Atlanta in recent weeks is in some ways even more indiscriminate, since many of the alleged terrorists are not even accused of property damage.\nMore from Gizmodo\nThe Best College Science and Tech Programs\nFast Food Apps, Ranked\nSign up for Gizmodo's Newsletter.

    "summary": "In a scene that mirrored history, spectators waiting to watch a Broadway musical about one of the most infamous antisemitic incidents in U.S. history were heckled outside the theater - by neo-Nazi protesters.\nThe show, \"Parade,\" is a dramatization of the story of Leo Frank, a Jewish pencil factory director in Atlanta who was convicted of the murder of 13-year-old Mary Phagan in 1913. He was abducted from prison and lynched by an angry mob two years later, and the case remains a lightning rod for the far-right.\n\nProtesters showed up outside the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre on Tuesday as spectators waited to see a preview of the Tony Award-winning musical.\n\"You want the truth about who you're going to see tonight? You're paying $300 to go worship a pedophile,\" one masked protester could be heard saying, using an expletive, in a clip shared by Jake Wasserman, an editor for the Jewish American publication, the Forward.\nIn the same footage, protesters can be seen holding a banner with a link to the website of the National Socialist Movement, which the Anti-Defamation League describes as \"the largest neo-Nazi group in the United States.\"\nOne Twitter user shared a photo of the fliers handed out by the protesters, which included a web address for a video platform operated by a group that the ADL describes as \"a loose network of individuals connected by their virulent antisemitism\" and Nazi SS logos.\nBen Platt, who plays Frank, said in an Instagram video that he heard about the protest after the show. \"It was definitely very ugly and scary, but a wonderful reminder of why we're telling this particular story and how special and powerful art and particularly theater can be,\" he said. \"And it made me feel extra, extra grateful to be the one that gets to tell this particular story and to carry on the legacy of Leo.\"\n\"Are you really doing the real work of an artist if you aren't be protested by Neo Nazi's?\" wrote Prentiss Mouton, another performer in the play, sharing footage of the protesters outside the theater in an Instagram story. \"If I wasn't proud enough to be a part of this production it was solidified today.\"\nFrank's case was significant due to the extensive antisemitic tropes used in protests and even some of the media reporting at the time. The Washington Post reported in 1983 that jurors in his murder trial heard shouts of \"Hang the Jew\" outside the courthouse, and members of the Jewish community, fearing for their safety, left Atlanta after Frank's lynching.\nThe killing was meticulously planned, The Post reported in 2017 - from the cutting of the prison phone lines to the draining of the gas from police vehicles to help the attackers escape. But no convictions were ever made for Frank's killing.\nThere were appeals against Frank's sentence over the years, with a former office boy from the pencil factory coming forward in the 1980s to say that he saw the key witness in the trial - a Black janitor, named Jim Conley - carrying the victim's lifeless body. The witness, by then in his 80s, said Conley threatened him and his parents told him not to speak out. It did not overturn Frank's sentence, but Conley was later convicted as an accessory in the case and would go on to serve sentences for violence against women.\nLater, in 1986, the Georgia State Board of Pardons and Paroles posthumously pardoned Frank, but only on the basis of its failure to ensure his safety while in custody, and not on his innocence.\nFrank's story remains significant for other reasons: The ADL was established in the same year as his conviction, with the aim of stopping \"the defamation of the Jewish people and to secure justice and fair treatment to all.\" And just a month after Frank's killing in 1915, a group of men - including some of those who took part in the lynching - revived the Ku Klux Klan.\n\"The trial and lynching of Leo Frank was one of the most virulent anti-Semitic episodes in American history,\" ADL National Director Abraham H. Foxman said in 2013 on the 100th anniversary of Frank's conviction. That same year, the Southern Poverty Law Center noted that neo-Nazi groups were creating propaganda websites about the case\nInterest in Frank's case continues, and so, too, does the antisemitism that colored his trial and killing. In January, an ADL survey found that 85 percent of Americans believe at least one anti-Jewish trope - a significant increase from the figure of 61 percent in 2019.",

    "summary": "It's not uncommon for people to become lost when hiking in national parks. As the National Park Service states on their website, hikers sometimes become disoriented or injure themselves while in the parks.\nBut when at least four people were found brutally murdered and dismembered in parks across the southeastern United States, investigators realized Mother Nature wasn't to blame. They would eventually learn that the perpetrator of such violent crimes was Gary Hilton, a man in his 50s who targeted unsuspecting nature lovers.\n\nThough he's been named a suspect in the murders of multiple individuals \u2014 Judy Smith, 51; Kason Knapp, 20; Rossana Miliani, 26; and Michael Scot Lewis, 27 \u2014 Hilton has only confessed to four.\nInvestigators had their first inkling that something sinister was afoot when avid hikers John, 80, and Irene Bryant, 84, failed to return after hiking the Pisgah National Forest in North Carolina on Oct. 21, 2007. Their son, Bob Bryant, reported them missing to police around Nov. 2, after which search efforts were organized, according to the Asheville Citizen-Times.\nInitially, it was believed that the couple could've been injured. Brevard Rescue Squad Brian Kreigsman told the Asheville Citizen-Times on Nov. 7 that Irene even attempted to call 911 on her cell phone around 4 p.m. on Oct. 21, but it never went through.\nThen, in the process of searching for the couple, investigators learned that the couple's credit card had been used in Ducktown, Tennessee, more than 100 miles away.\nInvestigator's worst fears were realized on Nov. 10, 2007, when search and rescue volunteers discovered a woman's body covered in leaves just 25 meters from where the Bryants had parked their SUV, the Asheville Citizen-Times reported. It would take three days to confirm it was Irene, as the body couldn't be physically identified. An autopsy would show that she had been bludgeoned to death.\nGary Michael Hilton Photo: AP Photo/John Bazemore\nThe FBI joined the investigation after Irene's body was found because the murder occurred on federal land. As part of their efforts, they offered a $10,000 award for information on the individual who had stolen the credit card. And since John hadn't been found, it was assumed he was still alive, possibly abducted by the wanted individual.\nEventually, on Feb. 3, 2008, hunter Mark Waldrop found a human skull in the Nantahala National Forest in Georgia. It was later determined to be that of John Bryant.\nBy the time that John's remains were found, authorities had recovered the decomposing body of 46-year-old mother of two Cheryl Hodges Dunlap, who worked as a nurse at Florida State University's student health center. She had been reported missing on Dec. 2, after she failed to show up to teach a Sunday school class, according to ABC News. Like the Bryants, Dunlap's credit card had been used by an unidentified white male following her last known sighting.\nHer body was found in the Apalachicola National Forest, located in the Florida Panhandle, by a group of hunters two weeks later, on Dec. 17, 2007.\nIn the eventual trial, prosecutors stated that Hilton had abducted Dunlap while she was reading by the Leon Sinks Geological Area and kept her captive for two days, before ultimately murdering and dismembering her, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.\nGary Michael Hilton Photo: Florida Department of Corrections\nA month after murdering Dunlap, Hilton zeroed in on his next victim: Meredith Emerson.\nThe 24-year-old had left a note for her roommate stating that she was going hiking with her dog, Ella, at the Vogel State Park in Georgia on New Year's Day, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. When she failed to return, search and rescue efforts began \u2014 though it was Hilton who would lead authorities to her remains.\nAuthorities had already issued appeals to the public asking for information about a man matching Hilton's appearance in connection to the murders of Dunlap and the Bryants. So when multiple individuals saw a man matching the suspect's appearance at a Chevron near Vogel State Park, they called in to the tip-line, according to the Atlanta Journal Constitution. When authorities arrived at the gas station on Jan. 5, 2008, they found Hilton and took him into custody.\nWhile in custody, Hilton ultimately confessed to killing Emerson, telling authorities from the Georgia Bureau of Investigation that he attacked her while she was hiking and she fought back, according to NBC News.\n\"She wouldn't stop,\" Hilton said. \"She wouldn't stop fighting. And yelling at the same time. So I needed to both control her and silence her.\"\nFull Episode Watch More True Crime On Oxygen In Our Free App\nAfter beating the young woman, he held her and the dog Ella\u2014the Labrador retriever was later found safe\u2014in his van, demanding she tell him the PIN number to her credit card, the outlet reported. However, Emerson repeatedly gave him the wrong PIN, so after three days, he tied her to a tree and killed her with a tire iron, though he described it as \"hard\" because they had \"spent several good days together.\"\nInvestigators also found a bloody top and a blood-stained seatbelt at a gas station where Hilton had attempted to use Emerson's credit card, according to the Associated Press. Hilton had apparently tried to clean his car following the murders.\nHilton ultimately led investigators to Emerson's body in exchange for prosecutors dropping the death sentence, according to the Baxter Bulletin.\nHe went on to stand trial for Dunlap's murder in 2011, with a jury returning a guilty verdict and recommending the death sentence. A year later, he pleaded guilty to five counts for the robbery, kidnapping and murder of John and Irene Bryant. He was sentenced to five consecutive life sentences, according to the Department of Justice.\nHilton is currently on death row in Florida, where he is held at the Union Correctional Institute. He is 76.",

    "excerpt": "There are more than 20 license-plate-reading cameras that take photos of passing vehicles in Monroe County, and they could soon come to Macon. Here's more.",
    "summary": "When a Columbus man drove a stolen car into Monroe County in late January, there were no cop cars waiting for him. A few minutes later, though, police arrested him after a chase that ended in a crash.\nNeremiah Johnson, who reportedly stole the car in Gray before driving toward Forsyth, was caught by a license-plate-reading camera, one of many installed over recent months in Monroe County.\nThe camera found the stolen vehicle's plate number in a database and reported it to a Monroe County sheriff's deputy, leading to the chase that ended with Johnson's capture and the car's recovery.\nJohnson's is one of five stolen vehicles recovered with the help of the camera system in the past three-to-four months, according to Monroe County Sheriff Brad Freeman. While the cameras help police track potential criminals, they also raise questions about privacy.\nA company named Flock Safety owns the cameras and sells their services to the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. There are more than 20 of these license-plate-reading cameras in Monroe County, Freeman said, all from Flock.\nThe cameras take photos of every car (and license plate) that passes by, but only report the license plate number to a deputy if it is connected to a crime, according to Flock spokesperson Holly Beilin.\nThe photos are stored on the camera for 30 days before being deleted. Flock and the Monroe sheriff's office did not disclose the locations of the cameras, though the one that scanned Johnson's plate was located on Juliette Road and GA Highway 87.\nFlock has been operating safety cameras since 2017, selling their services to both private groups and law enforcement agencies. They first started contracting in Middle Georgia in 2019, according to Beilin.\n'We operate on sort of a subscription model. For the license-plate-reading cameras, it's $2,500 per camera per year,' she said. 'The (Monroe County) sheriff's office owns all of that data, (Flock) does not have access to it.'\nSince only the sheriff's office can access the stored photos, they are used for investigative purposes only, Beilin said.\n'That way the pictures can be used after crimes for investigative purposes,' she said of the storage method. 'Say if someone robs your house while you're on vacation, you might not know about that for a while. Not all crime is known instantly, not all crime is reported.'\nFreeman said the cameras also help updating their stolen vehicle system.\n'We actually had two vehicles reported to us by Flock as stolen that had already been returned, so it helped us clean out our system and make sure it was up-to-date,' he said. 'With crimes, it's not going to solve a case for you, but it can give you a very good lead.'\nBoth Beilin and Freeman acknowledged that the cameras led to privacy concerns among Middle Georgians.\n'There is a little concern about tracking you, and we certainly understand that,' Freeman said. 'It's important to know that this camera isn't a tracking system, it only tells us about tags that are already attached to a crime.'\nBeilin noted that Flock cannot access the data and that the notifications sent to law enforcement are automated. She also emphasized that the photos are 'hard-deleted' after 30 days of storage.\nIn Flock's contract with the Monroe sheriff's office, a stipulation says that Flock 'may store deleted data' to meet certain legal standards. The deleted footage would only be accessible with a court order, the contract said.\nThe contract also states that Flock decided the locations of the cameras and had final say in their placement.\nFlock cameras are growing more popular with law enforcement, with other cameras located in the Atlanta area, Columbus and Houston County. Bibb County Sheriff David Davis recently announced his intent to install Flock cameras in Macon.",

    "summary": "Rural Georgia families say they're living in doctor deserts, meaning they have no access to adequate medical care for their children.\nSome families told Channel 2 Action News that they're traveling more than an hour away just for checkups.\nChannel 2 investigative reporter Ashli Lincoln found this is because there are no pediatricians in many of these communities.\nShe found there is a push from the state level to change this.\nFamilies who Channel 2 Action News spoke with say they're desperate and are willing to travel as far as they need for basic health care.\nBarnesville stay-at-home mother Candace Harwood said healthcare for her two sons is hard to come by.\n[HAVE A STORY FOR 2 INVESTIGATES? Submit your story idea here]\nTheir small rural Georgia community only has one pediatrician.\n'If we had more resources, especially in rural areas, I know we're not the only family that has specific needs,' Harwood said. 'Just to have more access to things because you never know what's going to happen to your child.'\nHer son David has a seizure disorder. The hardwood family makes monthly visits to Children's Healthcare of Atlanta, turning checkups into road trips\n'(It's) 55 to 58 minutes below Atlanta. So you're packing up all these bags, you're packing extra outfits. Sometimes you're packing blankets, making like little forwards in the bag so you can stop and rest and decompress,' Harwood said.\nAnd she isn't alone.\nMORE STORIES FROM 2 INVESTIGATES:\nInvestigators say online and social media drug sales are fueling fentanyl overdoses\nDoctors reveal game-changer to help stop fentanyl overdose crisis across metro and country\nGeorgia nurses accused of having fake diplomas say their degrees are legitimate\nFCC deals major blow to company accused of duping homeowners into 40-year-listing agreements\nOnline app used to help people pay rent fails, causing bigger issues for Cobb County woman\nVroom customers who didn't receive titles for months or years fight back through arbitration\nAlbany mother Laterria Wagstaff told Lincoln that she drives an hour and a half for quality pediatric care for her children because she said local doctor's offices are overcrowded and lack detailed care.\n'I just felt like I spent more time in the waiting room versus being in a room with a doctor,' Wagstaff said. 'I don't care how high the gas is if I know that where I'm going is going to get my child the best care and that's what I'm getting paid. No, no question.'\nDr. Lindsey Burnett is a pediatrician at Zoey Pediatrics in Barnesville. She told Lincoln that she sees firsthand families traveling across county lines to find adequate pediatric care.\nSpecialties in health and mental health for kids are few and far between,' Burnett said. 'We do see a lot of patients that drive a long way to get to us.'\nAccording to data Channel 2 Action News analyzed from the Georgia Composite Medical Board, more than 60 Georgia counties do not have a pediatrician.\nWe discovered Putnam and Haralson counties have one pediatrician practicing in their counties.\nThere are 15 pediatricians are registered in Rockdale County. In Newton, Gilmer, Pickens, and Spalding counties, there are 10 or fewer.\nIt's a staggering contrast to metro counties like Fulton and DeKalb which have more than 600 registered pediatricians combined.\n'This has definitely been on the radar with the Georgia Legislature,' said Amy Reeves, a pediatric physician's assistant, and member of the Georgia Healthcare Workforce Commission. 'You are not utilizing your workforce to their full potential, and you have rural Georgians who are not getting the care they need.'\nReeves said increasing the number of state-mandated physician assistants who can practice under a doctor would be pivotal in increasing healthcare in rural Georgia.\n'Currently as it stands, one physician can supervise four nurse practitioners and four Pas,' Reeves said.\nThe commission outlines the need for allowing more PAs to assist in practicing medicine under a doctor's supervision in a recent commission report sent to Gov. Brian Kemp last December by allowing more PAs to help assist and treat patients.\n'We can definitely see patients, treat patients, order any dialogistic test that needs to be ordered,' Reeves said. 'Georgia definitely lags behind the rest of the country.'\nBack in rural Georgia, Harwood and thousands of other families say they hope pediatric care expansion comes soon.\n'I think that it should be more readily available and then it'll make you feel less isolated,' Harwood said.\nFrom our investigation, we also found these communities are also dealing with a shortage of dentists, ER Doctors, and a psychologist -- a need as you can imagine these families desperately want.\nIN OTHER NEWS:",

    "summary": "The Big Chicken is one of Atlanta's great landmarks. But there's a lot you might not know about the 56-foot-tall structure.\n1. It was not built for a Kentucky Fried Chicken restaurant.\nS.R. \"Tubby\" Davis built it for his eatery\u00a0called Johnny Reb's Chick, Chuck 'N Shake in 1956 at 12 Cobb Parkway in Marietta. Highway 41 had just been built.\u00a0He thought it was a great way to advertise. In 1966, Davis sold the restaurant to his brother, who turned it into a KFC franchise.\n(Photo by Bob Andres)\n2. Prior to GPS, it was used for\u00a0directions in Marietta and\u00a0is mentioned in a video game.\nAnyone who drove before the days of GPS in Marietta knows it, but before GPS, drivers relied on maps, road signs, landmarks and stopping at gas stations to ask for help (well, maybe not male drivers.) In Marietta, directions virtually always included the Big Chicken. Ask anyone for directions in Marietta today\u00a0and the Big Chicken will still likely be included.\nAccording to AARP, Rock Band 3's \"Road Challenge Mode\"\u00a0references that fact, \"Don't be alarmed if you're asking for directions in the bus and the locals tell you to 'turn left at the Big Chicken.'\"\n(Photo by Marlene Karas AJC Archives)\n3. It was nearly torn down, but public outcry, including that from airplane pilots, saved it.\nIn 1993, a bad windstorm hit the Big Chicken. Combined with deterioration over the years, Kentucky Fried Chicken planned to tear it down. The public was not having it. There was a rally to save the chicken and the Cobb County Government noted that pilots even voiced their displeasure with the plan, saying they used the building as a reference when landing in Atlanta and at Dobbins. The company changed its plan and decided to rebuild.\nDuring the rebuild, there was talk that the new chicken would be contemporary and distinctively female. That didn't fly.

The renovated Big Chicken was going to be distinctly female.\nWhen Kentucky Fried Chicken decided to rebuild the Big Chicken in 1994, the company considered making the new Big Chicken look much more feminine. Eventually, KFC changed its\u00a0mind.\n5. The chicken's eyes and beak broke windows.\nIn 1964, the original motor that powered the chicken's eyes and beak caused so much vibration that all the windows shattered in the restaurant.\n(Photo courtesy of The Big Chicken Chorus)\n6.

Its founder, Bill Schreiner, suggested the chorus adopt the name of the famous landmark.

    "excerpt": "An indictment could boost former President Donald Trump's chances of winning the GOP nomination in 2024, say some of his supporters.",
    "summary": "An indictment could boost former President Donald Trump's chances of winning the GOP nomination in 2024.\nAt least that's the view of Trump supporters who spoke to NBC News at a rally Monday in Davenport, Iowa \u2014 which holds the first nominating contest on the calendar.\n\"I think it helps him,\" said Allen Hockemeyer, a 78-year-old farmer from Waterloo, Iowa, said of the criminal investigations into Trump in Manhattan, Atlanta and Washington, D.C. \"They're all a fraud.\"\nIn a post on his Truth Social media platform Saturday, Trump predicted that he would be indicted Tuesday in a case in New York involving alleged hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. A spokesperson from Trump told NBC News that the former president has not been notified of a possible pending indictment but based his remarks on \"illegal leaks\" from prosecutors.\nWhatever effect an indictment or conviction would have on Trump's hopes for winning a general election in 2024, his first priority is rallying Republicans to capture the nomination. He holds a lead in most national polls, with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis \u2014 who has not announced a bid \u2014 having distinguished himself as the strongest challenger in the early stages of the race.\n'It just energizes the base even more. This absolutely helps President Trump going into a primary,' one Washington-based Republican operative said in a phone call Saturday afternoon. 'I'm not so sure what it does in a general.'\nThe operative noted that there is a faction of the GOP that thinks Trump would already have trouble beating a Democrat and is looking for an alternative.\n'That's what the party is struggling with right now,' he said.\nSome prominent Republicans were quick to come to Trump's defense on Saturday, an indication that they don't fear political backlash from standing by him.\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., called the potential indictment an 'outrageous abuse of power' by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg and vowed to use congressional committees to investigate whether 'federal funds are being used to subvert our democracy by interfering in elections with politically motivated prosecutions.'\nRep. Marjorie Taylor-Greene, R-Ga., a close Trump ally, wrote on Twitter that Democrats are \"idiots\" who are \"sealing their own fate\" with the \"political weaponization\" of the legal system against Trump.\nThe top prosecutors in Manhattan and Fulton County, Ga., are Democrats. At the federal level, special prosecutor Jack Smith, who is investigating the Jan. 6 insurrection and Trump's handling of classified documents, was appointed by Attorney General Merrick Garland, who works in a Democratic administration.\nOne indication that Trump sees a political boon in the prospect of an indictment: He sent out fundraising appeals Saturday, over text and email, following his Truth Social posts.\nTraci Walters, a 52-year-old accountant from Cedar Rapids, Iowa, suggested Monday that Trump is uniquely suited to thrive politically in the face of legal challenges.\n'FAKE!' she blurted before a question about the investigations could be completed, adding that she's 'not at all' concerned he could be hurt by court cases.\n'He's been under the microscope for how many \u2014 what, 6, 7, 8 years now \u2014 they're not finding anything,' Walters said, describing herself as '100 percent' for Trump in the GOP primary. 'I mean, come on, who could survive that, right?'\nErnie Morgan, 52, of Muscatine, Iowa, expressed a similar sentiment about the specter of charges against Trump.\n\"I don't hold a lot of credence to that because it's unproven, it's unfounded at this point,\" he said, sitting with his wife and two children toward the back of the Adler Theater in Davenport before Trump's speech Monday.\n\"There's been so many cases in the past where there's been indictments tried to go down, and they never seem to materialize,\" Morgan said. \"So, I think with his proven track record, he'd be my guy in '24.\"\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "excerpt": "Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger wants his state to become an early presidential primary host \u2014 just not in 2024, as President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party are pushing. The\u2026",
    "summary": "ATLANTA (AP) \u2014 Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger wants his state to become an early presidential primary host \u2014 just not in 2024, as President Joe Biden and the Democratic Party are pushing.\nThe Republican election chief, who garnered attention for rebuffing then-President Donald Trump's efforts to overturn his 2020 loss in Georgia, told The Associated Press he'd back an early primary in 2028.\nIt's the first time Raffensperger, who sets Georgia's primary election dates, has endorsed the idea of Georgia as an early nominating state, though not as soon as the Democratic National Committee and the White House want.\n'Georgia would be a great early primary state in 2028,' Raffensperger told the AP.\n'It has a good cross-section of engaged voters from both parties, and, as everyone seems to now recognize, we run great elections,' the secretary added in a dig at Democrats' assertions that he and Republican Gov. Brian Kemp have worked to limit ballot access.\nRaffensperger's position highlights the Democrats' challenge in reordering their nominating calendar to elevate racially diverse electorates and de-emphasize Iowa and New Hampshire. Those overwhelmingly white states have opened the nominating process for both major parties for decades and still lead Republicans' 2024 calendar as it's currently set \u2014 with national GOP officials showing little interest in reconsidering their slate.\nThe secretary's announcement nonetheless shows Democrats aren't alone in wanting Georgia, now a premier general election battleground, to expand its burgeoning influence into presidential nominating politics.\nThe question is whether Democrats can find momentum among the Republicans who control the Georgia statehouse and with the national GOP forces necessary to make such a change. That's decidedly harder than Atlanta's push to win the 2024 Democratic convention, a decision that will be made entirely within the party.\nTop Georgia Democrats including Sen. Raphael Warnock and U.S. Rep. Nikema Williams of Atlanta support a presidential primary move, and the state party's former executive director, Scott Hogan, has taken on the role of the top unofficial lobbyist for the idea, reaching out to Republicans and the business community.\n'This isn't just a political conversation. This is very much an economic conversation,' said Williams, who is also the state Democratic chairwoman. 'It's a benefit across the board, whether Republicans or Democrats.'\nAudrey Haynes, a University of Georgia professor tracking the debate, cited studies showing how much more influential an average American voter becomes when they live in an early nominating state. The economic boon, she added, ranges from candidates' television advertising to a year's worth of tourism and consumer spending by traveling national media and the top campaigns' permanent field staffers.\n'There's just all this spending to go along with the attention on voters and on local elected officials,' Haynes said.\nUnder the Democratic National Committee plan approved Saturday, the party's 2024 presidential primaries would begin Feb. 3 in South Carolina, the state that propelled Biden's campaign in 2020. That primary would be followed by Nevada and New Hampshire on Feb. 6, Georgia on Feb. 13 and Michigan on Feb. 27.\nThe national party has given Georgia Democrats until June to show they can comply with that calendar, though deadline could be extended.\nRaffensperger noted the Republican National Committee has locked in its 2024 calendar, with the usual opening slate of Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. The GOP also plans to limit convention delegates from states that move up to disrupt that traditional quartet.\n'This type of move would need to be equitable, take place on the same day, and ensure that no one loses delegates,' Raffensperger said, offering no indications that he'd try to persuade the RNC to reconsider.\nJordan Fuchs, Raffensperger's deputy, said calendar reshuffles must 'at the start' be a 'bipartisan decision,' a tacit acknowledgement that Biden being the genesis of Democrats' plan does it no favors in Georgia.\n'Just because one party is pushing it doesn't mean it has bipartisan support,' she said.\nKemp, meanwhile, has given no public sign that he wants a change ahead of 2024. Additionally, Kemp's advisers have noted he has no official role in setting the primary dates.\nThat said, Kemp is at the apex of his influence as a second-term, battleground governor who won reelection by nearly 8 percentage points; he defeated Democratic power player Stacey Abrams for a second time after dominating a Republican primary challenger who had Trump's backing. So he would be key in any eventual shift.\nA top Kemp adviser, who wasn't authorized to speak on the record about an issue the governor isn't actively pursuing and requested anonymity, said Kemp and his inner circle do not dispute the long-term benefits Georgia would accrue as an early state.\nYet the considerations for the GOP aren't as straightforward as for Democrats.\nMultiple recent presidential cycles \u2014 Barack Obama's nomination in 2008, Hillary Clinton's in 2016 and Biden's in 2020 \u2014 have highlighted the power Black voters in the South already have in Democratic politics. Biden's path was especially emphatic, as he stormed to the nomination in a matter of weeks after finishing fourth in Iowa and fifth in New Hampshire, effectively highlighting their shortcomings as Democratic bellwethers. Those two states, though, still reflect the Republican Party's overwhelmingly white base, giving the GOP little incentive to depose them.\nNational Democrats, meanwhile, have made clear they want their early nominating window to be stacked with November battlegrounds; that would give their eventual nominee early exposure in key Electoral College states. Georgia Republicans, conversely, are still adjusting to their state's tossup status after dominating at all levels of government for decades before 2020, when Georgia opted narrowly for Biden and two Democratic senators.\n'I certainly believe it's a two-party state,' said Chip Lake, a veteran GOP campaign operative. 'But the conversations among Democrats on what all this means at the presidential level is just more advanced than it is for Republicans right now,' Lake said.\nAnd, he added, Kemp's previous statements have effectively cut off any bipartisan movement on primaries.\n'No one,' Lake said, 'wants to get out in front of the governor.'",

    "summary": "New multiyear collaboration between Florence Healthcare and IQVIA to ensure research sites participating in IQVIA studies have access to best-in-class site enablement technology to streamline operations and power remote connectivity.\nATLANTA, GA / ACCESSWIRE / March 14, 2023 / Florence Healthcare and IQVIA have entered a multiyear collaboration to ensure research sites participating in IQVIA studies have access to site enablement technology. IQVIA will leverage Florence's Site Enablement Platform, SiteLink\u2122, on studies to reduce clinical trial bottlenecks at sites caused by repetitive, manual document workflows.\nThrough SiteLink, Florence's top-rated electronic Investigator Site File (eISF), eBinders\u2122 can be deployed to research sites. Sites will control their eISF, and, thanks to SiteLink, monitors can instantly review documents in the eISF before transferring them to the electronic Trial Master File (eTMF).\nAs more than 80% of the eTMF originates in the eISF, this direct connection supports higher-quality documents and reduces study close-out turnaround times.\nAccording to Rajneesh Patil, VP of Clinical Operations and Head of Digital Strategy, Technology & Analytics Innovation at IQVIA: \"We're providing a more valuable site management experience while allowing more time and opportunities for site support, compliance reviews and continuous monitoring of patient safety and study quality.\"\nIn the past, remote monitoring solutions have often burdened sites instead of enabling them. Combined with site staffing constraints, this can lead to bottlenecks that prevent new treatments from reaching patients. eBinders has an industry-leading 92% site adoption rate, proving that sites will use the software when sponsors or CROs deploy it to them using SiteLink.\n\"This collaboration with IQVIA reflects our mission to eliminate the fragmented workflows that prevent cures,\" says Ryan Jones, CEO of Florence Healthcare. \"We believe that enabling research sites to do their best work while creating a digital connection between sponsors and sites will accelerate research from bench to bedside.\"\nTo date, Florence and IQVIA already have deployed SiteLink at a number of research sites and this extended collaboration will build on that success. By reducing fragmented workflows between sites, CROs and sponsors, IQVIA and Florence can help clinical researchers spend more of their time on developing life-saving therapies.\nABOUT FLORENCE HEALTHCARE\nFlorence Healthcare is a clinical research technology company bringing sponsors, CROs, and sites together through technology to accelerate clinical trials. The Florence\u2122 Site Enablement Platform is a comprehensive solution for managing document and data workflows across the entire clinical trial lifecycle with more than 12,000 research sites across 45 countries active in the platform, facilitating more than 6 million integrated research workflows every month, and hosting over 100,000 users from research sites, sponsors, and CROs. Florence is headquartered in Atlanta, GA, with offices around the globe.

The girl's name and signature are on the ticket.\nHurley has this advice for other parents, 'Watch your kids in Walmart.'\nChannel 2 Action News checked with Milton Police to see if the officer had any discretion in this situation.\nThey told us the department must issue a criminal trespass warning at the request of a private business or homeowner.\n[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]\nIN OTHER NEWS:",

    "summary": "The Cure is hitting the road for a North American trek that includes three dates each at Los Angeles' Hollywood Bowl and New York's Madison Square Garden. This will be the first time the band plays any North American shows since its 2019 festival appearances and its first tour in the region since 2016.\nFollowing a slate of 2022 European concerts, the Cure's 'Shows of a Lost World' tour will kick off on May 10 in New Orleans and hit 30 stops across the U.S. and Canada with a closing show on July 1 in Miami. The Cure will be supported by Scottish post-punk band the Twilight Sad at all shows. See the full lineup below.\n\n\n\n\nNotably, the announcement pointed out that the Cure has mandated that 'there will be no \u2018platinum' or \u2018dynamically priced' tickets on this tour,' apart from a few Hollywood Bowl charity seats. The move to turn off Ticketmaster's platinum pricing for the tour goes against the ticketing trend that has often seen face value for select tickets skyrocketing soon after they go on sale, most famously in the case of Bruce Springsteen's current tour.\nTickets will be made available via Ticketmaster Verified Fan Sale, which is open for registration now, on March 15.\nThough the band's last studio album was 2008's '4:13 Dream,' frontman Robert Smith\u00a0has regularly teased a new body of work from the band throughout the past few years. Last year, the band reissued 1992's 'Wish,' and Smith most recently remixed Noel Gallagher's 'Pretty Boy' single.\nMay10 NEW ORLEANS, LA Smoothie King Center12 HOUSTON, TX Toyota Center13 DALLAS, TX Dos Equis Pavilion14 AUSTIN, TX Moody Center16 ALBUQUERQUE, NM Isleta Amphitheater18 PHOENIX, AZ Desert Diamond Arena20 SAN DIEGO, CA NICU Amphitheatre23 LOS ANGELES, CA Hollywood Bowl24 LOS ANGELES, CA Hollywood Bowl25 LOS ANGELES, CA Hollywood Bowl27 SAN FRANCISCO, CA Shoreline Amphitheatre\nJune01 SEATTLE, WA Climate Pledge Arena02 VANCOUVER, BC Rogers Arena04 SALT LAKE CITY, UT Vivint Smart Home Arena06 DENVER, CO, Fiddler's Green Amphitheatre08 MINNEAPOLIS ST.

    "excerpt": "The solo acoustic run of shows kicks off on Apr. 30.",
    "summary": "Citizen Cope is hitting the road for a run of East Coast tour dates starting in late April and running through May, the underground singer-songwriter announced Wednesday (Mar. 1).\nDubbed All The Songs You Want To Hear, the tour is leaving many Citizen Cope fans to wonder which of the more than 100 tunes in his catalog he'll be performing. Over the last decade, the singer-songwriter (born Clarence Greenwood) has released seven studio albums, each bearing his unique urban folk style steeped in peculiar earnestness and passionate indulgence. In addition, he's appeared on tracks with Stick Figure, Santana, Sheryl Crow and the Easy Dub Reggae All-Stars (for an impossibly perfect cover of Radiohead\u2018s 'Karma Police'), creating an impressive catalog of work that's still growing. Notably, his 2004 album, The Clarence Greenwood Recordings, is expected to be certified platinum by the RIAA this year despite never spending a week on any Billboard chart.\n\n\n\n\nObvious picks for the 2023 tour include Cope's most streamed tracks, including 'Let the Drummer Kick,' 'Sideways,' 'Pablo Picasso,' 'Bullet and a Target,' 'Son's Gonna Rise,' 'Justice' and 'Scared of Heights.' Possible curveballs include songs like 'More Than It Seems' and 'Brother Lee,' both of which highlight Cope's skill for using tempo and rapid wordplay to layer urgency and tension into his songs.\nIn a press release, Cope says The All the Songs You Want to Hear tour will be a solo acoustic experience 'that will ultimately lift all of our spirits. In a world that can look so divided, it's great to have people gather under one roof, who have different beliefs, opinions, and personal identities to connect and celebrate life through the power of music.'\nTickets are on sale now.

    "summary": "ANDOVER, Mass., Feb. 23, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Transmural Systems the leader in transcatheter electrosurgery for structural interventions announced today successful first-in-human procedure with its TELLTALE electrosurgical guidewire system. The TELLTALE Guidewire System is the first and only dedicated electrosurgical solution to simplify the BASILICA-TAVR procedure for transcatheter traversal and laceration of native and bioprosthetic tissue in patients at risk for coronary obstruction or compromised coronary access.\nThe TAVR market is expected to be $10 billion by 2028 with the expansion into low-risk younger patients. However, Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement (TAVR) may cause life threatening coronary artery obstruction, whether implanted for native aortic stenosis or bioprosthetic valve failure. Coronary obstruction during TAVR is associated with up to 50% mortality. The TELLTALE guidewire may be used to lacerate both native and bioprosthetic valve leaflets to enable safe implantation of the TAVR by preventing coronary obstruction.\nThe first TELLTALE procedure in the United States was performed at St. Francis Hospital & Heart Center, Roslyn NY, by Dr. Jaffar Khan and team. \"TELLTALE is a beautifully elegant and intuitive device that allowed us to successfully treat this patient with severe native aortic stenosis who was at high risk of TAVR-induced coronary obstruction,\" commented Dr. Khan. \"The targeted leaflet was effectively lacerated within just a few minutes, allowing for safe implantation of the TAVR valve.\"\n\"Doctors Babaliaros and Greenbaum, Co-directors of the Structural Heart and Valve Center at Emory University in Atlanta, GA, and pioneers in the field propose that \"Transcatheter electrosurgery-assisted BASILICA is the only 'tried and true' method to guarantee laceration while minimizing unwanted tearing or embolization of often heavily calcified leaflets. The Transmural Systems dedicated TELLTALE guidewire system is the first to accomplish this and promises to be a huge advance for those in need of leaflet modification prior to TAVR.\"\n\"The TELLTALE system will offer a much-needed treatment option for patients with native valves or failing bioprosthetic valves requiring a TAVR,\" said Dr. Toby Rogers, interventional cardiologist, and scientific lead for the MedStar Heart & Vascular Institute Structural Heart Disease program.\n\"We are very pleased with the start of enrollment in the United States allowing us to move forward with our clinical plan said Transmural Systems CEO Nasser Rafiee. We believe TELLTALE will provide the simplicity and reliability physicians have been asking for during BASILICA procedures. We expect to be the first dedicated electrosurgical leaflet laceration device coming to market as early as 2024.\"\nAbout Transmural Systems\nTransmural Systems\u00a0is a medical device company with a platform of innovative electrosurgical therapies and new treatment options for patients suffering from heart failure.

This is an extension of Fresenius Kidney Care's partnership with the national organization to incorporate healthy living and active learning into the Club Experience.\nA new aspect of the partnership this year, Fresenius Kidney Care is supporting Boys & Girls Clubs of America's youth advocacy efforts in Washington, D.C. During its National Advocacy Days event, leaders from Boys & Girls Clubs across the country harness the power of their voice to advocate for positive change and critical support from elected officials. Their advocacy has resulted in substantial funding increases and policy wins that move the needle on issues facing America's youth.\nFresenius Kidney Care has supported Boys & Girls Clubs of America's Healthy Habits by activating \"The Kidney Kid Program\" in 20 local Boys & Girls Clubs. \"The Kidney Kid Program\" is an education module hosted by Fresenius Kidney Care employee volunteers for youth, their families, and caregivers to teach the importance of kidney health. Fresenius Kidney Care volunteers spend time with Club kids to discuss the importance of eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, and recommending other healthy actions to keep their kidneys healthy. Club participants complete challenges in activity books, play games, enjoy healthy snacks, and participate in fun physical activities. The partnership continues through 2023 at select Clubs across the country.\n\"It's fitting that we announce this donation during National Kidney Month,\" said Fresenius Kidney Care President Dennis Kogod. \"This is a time when we try to raise awareness about chronic kidney disease (CKD), one of the world's fastest growing chronic ailments. Educating kids now about the importance of nutrition, exercise, and overall healthy habits means a healthier future for them and our country.\"\nThe partnership between Fresenius Kidney Care and Boys & Girls Clubs of America could have a significant impact as Boys & Girls Clubs provide safe placing, caring mentors, and life-enhancing experiences to more than 3.6 million young people at nearly 5,000 locations across the nation.\n\"We are thrilled to continue our partnership with Fresenius Kidney Care and add their participation to our 2023 National Advocacy Days,\" said Chastity Mitchell, National Vice President, Advocacy & Government Relations at Boys & Girls Clubs of America. \"Their support is enabling a set of our Clubs, several of which have \u00a0participated in The Kidney Kid Program and serve communities suffering from hunger, to advocate for support on critical food security issues facing our youth.\"\nDuring National Kidney Month, Fresenius Kidney Care supports worldwide efforts to raise awareness about kidney health, as 1 in 7 American adults are estimated to have kidney disease, but because symptoms are hard to identify without getting tested, 90% don't know they have it.1 That's why CKD is known as a \"silent disease\" in its early stages, and why throughout March, the company is spreading the word about the importance of getting screened and detecting kidney disease early.

    "summary": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Newly reelected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia is promising to use his first full term to cut deals where possible with Republicans and deliver for his home state. But he's adding a new role: unapologetic supporter of President Joe Biden.\nWarnock, who tried to avoid mention of Biden during his hard-fought campaign last year against Republican Herschel Walker, said he looks forward to supporting Biden if the president runs, as he has indicated he will, for a second term in 2024.\n'I'm not going to get ahead of the president,' Warnock told The Associated Press in a wide-ranging interview Wednesday. 'I think he will announce that he's going to run and ... I intend to support him.'\nWarnock, 53, sidestepped questions about his political ambitions but indicated he was warming to his status as a leading figure among Georgia Democrats. He said he is lobbying Biden and national Democrats to choose Atlanta for the party's 2024 national convention. And he supports a plan by the Democratic National Committee, championed by Biden, to make Georgia an early nominating state in the presidential primary process.\nWarnock has faced voters five times over the past three years in an unusual combination of primaries, special elections, traditional elections and runoffs. Now he can settle into a six-year term.\nAs he did during his last campaign, Warnock plays up the substance of his elected job \u2014 pushing Republicans in Georgia to expand Medicaid, capping insulin costs for diabetics on Medicare, working with Republicans on Capitol Hill to keep Georgia-based military operations open. That's in addition to his service as senior pastor at Atlanta's Ebenezer Baptist Church.\n'I don't want to give them too much credit, but it's just obvious that they ran a very good campaign,' said Chip Lake, a top adviser to Walker's campaign.\nWarnock lamented some of the most searing attacks against him, especially tied to his position at Ebenezer , where Martin Luther King Jr. preached. Republicans hammered him for getting a $7,000-plus monthly housing allowance from the church. It was considerably higher than during his pre-Senate tenure and was a way for Warnock to continue to draw money from his pastor's role while avoiding exceeding the Senate's cap on members' outside wage income.\n'We followed all of the requirements, and we disclosed everything,' he said.\nLake said it's a mistake to dismiss Warnock's abilities simply because of how much Walker, a former football star and first-time candidate, struggled to navigate his troubled past.\nWarnock's winning runoff margin \u2014 just shy of 3 percentage points \u2014 was less than Republican Gov. Brian Kemp's nearly 8-point victory in November over Democrat Stacey Abrams. But the bottom line, Lake said, is that Warnock did the same thing Kemp did: 'He figured out to win his base and the middle.'\nThe senator insists that he always will 'work with anybody,' even the most conservative, Trump-allied Republicans. He declined to offer details about his relationships with Republican senators, saying he does not want to hurt them politically.\n'When we're working together to get things done, sometimes that's not all that sexy to people and all that interesting,' he said.\nWarnock cited his collaboration with Rep. Buddy Carter, R-Ga., and the congressional delegation's work on infrastructure, agriculture and in-state defense facilities. Warnock said there's a group of senators from both parties who are willing to build on his measure that caps Medicare recipients' monthly insulin costs at $35.\n'We ought to be able to get that done for people on private insurance as well,' Warnock said, though he would not identify GOP senators who might help the effort in a chamber where it takes 60 votes to move most legislation.\nYet alongside his talk of bipartisanship, Warnock leveled a withering critique at Kemp and Georgia Republicans who have declined to expand Medicaid under the 2010 Affordable Care Act. The decision means hundreds of thousands of Georgians are not considered poor enough to qualify for existing Medicaid but also are not wealthy enough to use the health law's marketplace.\n'It's obvious that Georgia ought to expand Medicaid. I mean, it's really obvious. And the only thing that gets in the way of that is politics,' Warnock said, noting that many Republican-run states are among the 38 that have expanded Medicaid.\nWarnock said he has talked with Kemp since their respective victories but would not detail their conversations.\nWarnock said he does 'pinch himself' because of his role and status as Georgia's first Black senator. He noted that his office is located in an imposing Washington edifice named for the late Georgia Sen. Richard Russell, who was serving when Warnock was born in 1969.\n'He got a lot of things done for Georgia. He did. But he was also a segregationist,' Warnock said. 'I am inspired when I think about the arc of American history and what's possible. We still have a long ways to go, but we've gotten a lot done.'",

    "summary": "A wise woman once said, 'If at first, you don't succeed, dust yourself off and try again.' And while the late Aaliyah was hinting at an exchange between her and a potential suitor, the same applies when it comes to shooting your shot as an entrepreneur \u2014 just ask the founders of Slim & Husky's Pizza Beeria.\nThe post These Founders Launched A Moving Company With $3K That Turned Into The Popular Slim & Husky's Pizza Beeria appeared first on AfroTech.\nBefore their pizza shop came to fruition, Derek Moore, Clint Gray, and Emmanuel 'EJ' Reid launched a moving company that was community-based with a huge focus on giving back.\n'What's crazy is when we first opened up, it was stemming from the sale of our initial business, which was a moving company,' Gray told Will Lucas during an appearance on Black Tech Green Money podcast. 'And our moving company was community-based. We were hiring our friends that had been incarcerated and we had a big focus on giving back to our people and giving them jobs and providing opportunities.'\nNow, Slim & Husky's \u2014 a fast, casual artisan pizza shop that infuses their love of Hip-Hop and R&B culture \u2014 has soared far beyond its home base of Nashville, TN.\nThe establishment is now available in other Tennessee cities like Antioch, Chattanooga, Memphis, and Murfreesboro. Slim & Husky's is also located in Atlanta, GA, and even Sacramento, CA.\nSlim & Husky's isn't like your average pizza shop though. The ultimate vision has always been to be a place that authentically reflects the culture.\n'We wanted to basically put our story, our culture, everything that, you know, creates the Black experience, on our walls,' Moore explained. 'We felt like there was room for a concept and restaurant brand, not just the pizza, but something that told the story of Black culture in a high-end way.'\nMoore continued: 'The only thing Italian about our concept is the pizza. Everything else is 100 percent African American culture and our way to tell that story to the world.'\nIt has never solely been about the money for the trio.\nEven when they launched their moving company with just $3,000, the sentiment was the same \u2014 provide the community with something that can help them build together.\n'We were 25 when we started our first company and we started that company with $3,000. So, we were naive enough to think that this would work \u2014 and it did,' said Gray. 'We just wanted to solve a problem. We saw a need. It's not like we were passionate about moving furniture, but we had a passion for being entrepreneurs, and we had a passion for solving problems and filling a void and a need.'",

    "summary": "In this article, we discuss 11 high growth utility stocks to buy. If you want to see more stocks in this selection, check out 5 .\nThe US utilities industry in 2023 aims to provide reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy or safe water to customers, but face challenges in balancing the energy equation due to pressure around decarbonization, cleaner energy adoption, electrification, infrastructure needs, and customer-driven disruption.\nThe electric power sector faced both risks and opportunities in 2022. US electricity sales increased by 3.6% in the first eight months compared to the previous year, as the pandemic recovery progressed. However, costs rose significantly due to natural gas prices more than doubling, which was caused by global shortages worsened by Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Extreme weather events such as droughts, hurricanes, heat waves, and wildfires also continued to test the resilience of the regional power grids. To address these challenges, the industry and policymakers worked to increase reserves, deploy energy storage and microgrids, strengthen infrastructure, and enhance flexible load options. In 2023, despite the challenges faced by the US utilities industry, the emergence of new technologies and supportive policies could present opportunities and aid the industry in achieving its objectives.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act of the Biden administration, worth $430 billion, includes funding for tax credits and direct payments to promote the adoption of solar, wind, battery, and other energy sources and facilitate the transition of the electric power industry away from fossil fuels. Large American electric utility firms specializing in renewable power projects will be the biggest beneficiaries from the federal clean energy funding.\nEmily Beagle, research associate at Webber Energy Group at the University of Texas at Austin, noted that the location of utility companies will determine how much they stand to gain from the Inflation Reduction Act. Solar projects in sunnier states of the South and Southwest and wind projects in the Midwest are likely to gain the highest IRA budget, she said.\nSome of the best utility stocks to invest in include NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D). However, in this article we discuss the best high growth utility stocks to buy.\nOur Methodology\nWe used a stock screener and filtered for utility companies with year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of more than 30%. From the resultant dataset, we selected the utility stocks with the highest revenue growth rates as of the end of the third and fourth quarter of 2022, according to the latest data available for each firm. The list is arranged in ascending order of the year-over-year quarterly revenue growth rate.\nPixabay/Public Domain\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 30\nQuarterly Revenue Growth YoY as of September 29, 2022: 32.20%\nEversource Energy (NYSE:ES) is a Massachusetts-based public utility holding company specializing in the energy delivery business. The company operates through Electric Distribution, Electric Transmission, Natural Gas Distribution, and Water Distribution segments. On February 1, Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) declared a $0.675 per share quarterly dividend, a 5.9% increase from its prior dividend of $0.637. The dividend is payable on March 31, to shareholders of record on March 2.\nOn January 24, Evercore ISI analyst Durgesh Chopra upgraded Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) to Outperform from In Line, with a price target of $92, up from $86. The analyst rolled out its 2025 EPS forecasts, while also updating 12-month price targets for the firm's Power & Utilities coverage. The analyst remains bullish on the sector but is now cautious entering 2023, expecting a reversal of last year's outperformance, as the group is considered expensive both absolutely and relatively to bond yields and the S&P 500.\nAccording to Insider Monkey's third quarter database, 30 hedge funds were long Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES), compared to 32 funds in the prior quarter. GLG Partners is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 1.6 million shares worth $130.5 million.\nIn addition to NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE), Duke Energy Corporation (NYSE:DUK), and Dominion Energy, Inc. (NYSE:D), Eversource Energy (NYSE:ES) is one of the top utility stocks to monitor.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 31\nQuarterly Revenue Growth YoY as of September 29, 2022: 34.30%\nThe Southern Company (NYSE:SO) was incorporated in 1945 and is headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia. The company engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. It operates through Gas Distribution Operations, Gas Pipeline Investments, Wholesale Gas Services, and Gas Marketing Services segments. The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is one of the most prominent high growth stocks to invest in. On January 20, the company declared a $0.68 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on March 6, to shareholders of record on February 21.\nOn January 18, Credit Suisse analyst Nicholas Campanella raised The Southern Company (NYSE:SO)'s price target to $70 from $60 as he reviewed investment drivers for the company and provided his 2023 preview, where he expects flat EPS growth YoY compared to 2022. The growth will be impacted by financing costs, a reversal of favorable weather and usage, GP's rate settlement with backend-weighted revenue requirements, and dilution from the 2022 convert. Despite the price target increase, the analyst maintained an Underperform rating on the shares.\nAccording to Insider Monkey's data, 31 hedge funds were bullish on The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) at the end of Q3 2022, compared to 29 funds in the last quarter. Jim Simons' Renaissance Technologies is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 3.06 million shares worth $208.2 million.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 14\nQuarterly Revenue Growth YoY as of September 29, 2022: 36.10%\nNational Grid plc (NYSE:NGG) is a London-based company that transmits and distributes electricity and gas. The company operates through UK Electricity Transmission, UK Electricity Distribution, UK Electricity System Operator, New England, and New York segments. National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG) is one of the top high growth utility stocks to buy, with quarterly year-over-year revenue growth of 36.1% as of September 29, 2022.\nOn February 13, RBC Capital analyst Alexander Wheeler reinstated coverage of National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG) with an Outperform rating and a price target of 1,250 GBp following the completion of the gas transmission sale. The analyst listed National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG)'s \"highly visible\" growth, continued ability to outperform, and attractive valuation as reasons for the positive view. He believes that the market should give more credit to National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG)'s lower-risk growth profile.\nAccording to Insider Monkey's Q3 data, 14 hedge funds were long National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG), compared to 10 funds in the preceding quarter. Israel Englander's Millennium Management is a prominent position holder in the company, with 320,578 shares worth $16.5 million.\nHere is what ClearBridge Investments SMID Cap Growth Strategy has to say about National Grid plc (NYSE:NGG) in its Q4 2021 investor letter:\n'National Grid is one of the world's largest publicly owned utilities, focused on transmission and distribution activities in electricity and gas. National Grid performed strongly during the quarter as the business continued to de-risk following prior regulatory decisions and significant M&A. The company also benefited from falling real rates, a solid set of half-year results and strong Investor Day presentations.'\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 54\nQuarterly Revenue Growth YoY as of September 29, 2022: 37.30%\nConstellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is headquartered in Baltimore, Maryland, and it generates and sells electricity in the United States. The company operates through five segments \u2013 Mid-Atlantic, Midwest, New York, ERCOT, and Other Power Regions. It is one of the best high growth utility stocks to monitor, with year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 37.30% as of September 29, 2022.\nOn January 31, Wells Fargo analyst Neil Kalton raised Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG)'s price target to $115 from $106 and maintained an Overweight rating on the shares. The analyst believes there are multiple paths for value-added cash deployment and expects the Q4 update to provide more insight into the company's approach to capital allocation. Wells Fargo recommends buying the stock on recent weakness.\nAccording to Insider Monkey's data, 54 hedge funds were long Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) at the end of September 2022, compared to 43 funds in the prior quarter. John Smith Clark's Southpoint Capital Advisors is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 3.50 million shares worth $291 million.\nAlger Capital made the following comment about Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n'Constellation Energy Corporation (NASDAQ:CEG) is America's leading clean energy company, based on carbon-free production. The company is the largest supplier of clean energy and sustainable solutions to homes, businesses, governments, community aggregations, and a range of wholesale customers (such as municipalities, cooperatives, and other end markets) across the continental U.S., backed by approximately 32,400 megawatts of generating capacity consisting of nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas and hydroelectric assets. Constellation produces nearly 10% of the nation's carbon-free energy.\nShares outperformed during the third quarter primarily due to the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). Signed into law in august, the bill provides a nuclear production tax credit of approximately $43.75 per megawatt hour of energy generated. This credit favorably impacted earnings, resulting in an increase in Constellation's share price.'\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 30\nQuarterly Revenue Growth YoY as of December 30, 2022: 41.30%\nDTE Energy Company (NYSE:DTE) was founded in 1903 and is headquartered in Detroit, Michigan.

The analyst maintained an Overweight rating on the shares.

Michael Gelband's ExodusPoint Capital is a significant position holder in the company, with 663,246 shares worth $76.3 million.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 28\nQuarterly Revenue Growth YoY as of December 30, 2022: 41.10%\nPPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) is a Pennsylvania-based utility holding company that provides electricity and natural gas in the United States and the United Kingdom.

The analyst has also initiated coverage of the Canadian oil and gas space with a Positive view. He is optimistic on producers who are well-positioned in a volatile environment. In addition, the analyst has a cautious but positive view on midstream names in 2023, as the tailwinds of volume growth should support fee-based EBITDA growth and return of capital initiatives.\nAmong the hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, PPL Corporation (NYSE:PPL) was part of 28 public stock portfolios at the end of Q3 2022, and Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group held the largest stake in the company, with 7.18 million shares worth $182 million.\nIn addition to NextEra Energy, Inc.

    "summary": "The 35-year-old Non-Profit to Increase COVID-19 Vaccinations For Black Children Across the United States\nHARLEM, N.Y., Jan. 30, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Black Health, the Harlem, NY based nonprofit organization\u00a0that champions the promotion of health and prevention of diseases to reduce disparities and achieve equity within the black community launches Get Me Vaxxed, the new campaign for Black History Month.\u00a0The\u00a0campaign is part of a broader endeavor to boost black health at a time when health outcomes for black communities generally continue to be concerning and lag behind those of other groups. The campaign aims to raise COVID-19 vaccinations amongst black children aged 6-months to 5-years old.\nGet Me Vaxxed\u00a0comes on the heels of a November 2022 CDC report\u00a0which concluded that just 8.8 percent of 2- to 4-year-olds had at least one dose of the vaccine, a rate that researchers, pediatricians and others consider to be way too low. Those vaccination rates trail a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis\u00a0alarmingly showing that, in most states collecting the data, far fewer Black 5- to 11-year-olds than white kids in that age group had been vaccinated against COVID-19.\n\"My upper arm bears a mark left by a life-saving vaccine I received back when I was an Alabama schoolgirl. With Get Me Vaxxed, we are centering our overriding determination that Black children will be protected against a disease that now is endemic, just like the flu is,\" said C. Virginia Fields, Black Health's President and\u00a0CEO.\nThe new campaign will launch in six key demographics facing racial disparities in vaccinations and where Black Health has extensive partnerships: Atlanta, GA; Baton Rouge, LA; Columbia, SC; New York City and\u00a0Syracuse, NY; and Tuskegee, AL.\u00a0Black Health will target black families using grassroots outreach as well as traditional and social media channels.\nAbout Black Health:\nBlack Health is a 35-year-old nonprofit organization that started out as the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS \u2014 to improve Black well-being. In addition to our ongoing HIV initiatives, we're addressing Black mental health, breast and prostate cancers, diabetes, heart disease, obesity, sickle cell disease, disparities in health care delivery and resources and the sometimes-troublesome encounters between Black patients and health care providers.\nMs. Fields is available for interviews about the campaign and goals, especially across New York City; please contact: Kim Wilson Marshall, Wilson Marshall PR + Events, 352721@email4pr.com or 646.721.4375\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/black-health-launches-get-me-vaxxed-campaign-for-black-history-month-301732492.html\nSOURCE Black Health",

    "summary": "Ashnikko is creating a magical, post-apocalyptic world for her first project. Along with releasing the single 'Worms,' the blue-haired alt-pop singer announced her debut album Weedkiller, out on June 2, and a tour later this year.\nThe forthcoming LP, co-produced by Slinger and Oscar Scheller, is set to include tracks like 'Worms,' the Ethel Cain-featuring 'Dying Star, and lead single 'You Make Me Sick!' The LP's concept revolves around a civilization 'occupied and destroyed by machines that feed on organic matter.' Ashnikko, a fairy, 'seeks revenge by becoming part-machine.'\n\n\n\n\n'My bioluminescent heart is glowing. My post-apocalyptic fae world is here for you to journey into,' she said in a press release. 'My wings have been ripped out, but I've built them anew using Weedkiller machine parts. I am the one sent here to eliminate you, Weedkiller.'\nThe album concept is set to be a commentary on global warming, the environmental disaster, and the 'rapid evolution of technology.' Through the album, she aims to give a 'thundering voice to the oppressed.'\nOn Instagram, Ashnikko revealed that the project is based on a short story she wrote two years ago.\n'I've been pouring my heartblood into conceptualizing, myth-making, and lore-building with some of my closest friends and collaborators,' she said. 'Thank you for being here to step into my post-apocalyptic dystopian fae world.'\nAlong with performing at Coachella this year, Ashnikko will go on a world tour, making stops in Japan, Australia, the U.S., and Europe. Her U.S. dates will begin in September in Minneapolis before stopping in cities like New York, Charlotte, and Oakland.\nAlthough this is her debut album, Ashnikko released a 10-track mixtape called Demidevil in 2021, which featured 'Deal With It' with Kelis, 'Slumber Party' with Princess Nokia, and 'Daisy.' She also dropped EP Hi, It's Me.\nWeedkiller tracklist:\n1. World Eater2. You Make Me Sick!3. Worms4. Super Soaker (ft. Daniela Lalita)5. Don't Look At It6. Cheerleader7. Moonlight Magic8.

Well now is your chance.\nFor the first time ever, Candy Crush Saga is rewarding its All Stars tournament winners with three championship rings worth $75,000 in total, designed by Atlanta-based jeweler, Icebox. The fierce competition kicks off this Thursday, March 23 when players can compete in-game for an invitation to the live final in London, and a chance to take home a share of the $250,000 prize pot and the championship rings.\nTo kick off the 2023 All Stars tournament, Candy Crush Saga has partnered with GRAMMY-nominated Hip Hop artist and long-time player of the game, Saweetie, to star in a new film that reveals the diamond-encrusted championship rings up for grabs.\nMo, Rafi and Z, the three brothers behind Icebox who have made iconic jewels for Hip Hop legends, as well as championship rings for the biggest names in sport, are the creators of the trio of bling rings. The three handcrafted rings for the First, Second and Third place winners will be iced out to the max with rare gems inspired by the game's iconic candies. Dripping in Amethysts, Yellow and Orange Sapphires, Rubies, Blue Topaz and Brown Tourmaline, set into the 14K Gold Candy Drip for a color-popping sensation.\nThe championship rings are so exclusive, not even 'ICY GRL' herself Saweetie could swipe one. Starring in a new film, the jewelry-obsessed rapper tries to raid the Icebox briefcase; mission not accomplished. The 'ICY GRL' hitmaker, real name Diamont\u00e9, is known for her love of rocks, often decked out in her iconic 'ICY' diamond chain and encrusted grills, but the Candy Crush All Stars ring is one rock she couldn't get her hands on. The only way anyone - even GRAMMY Award Nominated rappers - can get hold of these rings is to Crush their way to a spot in the Final.\nRapper Saweetie\u00a0commented: \"As the original 'ICY GRL', you know I love my ice! Icebox's pieces are so special and amazing. It was a pleasure developing the idea for the short film created in partnership with director Scott Kelley and Candy Crush Saga. I even flexed my best athletic skills inspired by my favorite female spy movie, but I still couldn't get those beautiful rings on my fingers! The Candy Crush championship rings need to be a part of my icy collection, so I'll definitely be tapping into the All Stars tournament! I know das right!\"\nZahir \"Z\" Jooma, Icebox Founder and Jewelry Designer, says: \"When Candy Crush Saga came to us and asked us to create their first ever All Stars championship rings, it was an opportunity we couldn't turn down. We've designed for platinum-selling artists, and next level athletes, and now we're handcrafting a one-of-a-kind piece of ice for the best Crushers out there.\"\nFernanda Romano, Chief Marketing Officer at King, makers of the Candy Crush franchise,\u00a0says: \"The amount of dedication and passion our players put into the tournament is incredible, so it only seems right to reward them like the true champions they are. Candy Crush All Stars is one of the biggest tournaments on the planet, and we want to make sure the rewards for our winners reflect that. So, this year, to mark King's 20th anniversary, we're giving away our biggest prize ever. Taking inspiration from the world's largest sporting events, three finalists can win an epic candified championship ring that has Saweetie's seal of approval alongside the biggest prize pot ever announced for a casual mobile game.\"\nThe free-to-enter Candy Crush All Stars tournament goes live on March 23, open to anyone over 18 years old from select markets who are Level 25 and higher.

    "excerpt": "The train that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 3 was operated by Norfolk Southern, a rail corporation based in Atlanta.",
    "summary": "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine on Wednesday said the company whose train derailed in eastern Ohio and sent up a plume of toxic chemicals needs to stick around to deal with the aftermath of the disaster.\n'They are responsible for this. They are responsible for a very serious train wreck that occurred with some very toxic material,' DeWine said on CNN's 'This Morning.' 'So we're going to hold their feet to the fire, we're going to make sure they pay for everything as we move forward.'\nThe train that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 3 was operated by Norfolk Southern, a rail corporation based in Atlanta. Hazardous chemicals \u2014 including vinyl chloride, a toxic flammable gas \u2014 were released after the crash, causing a massive fire to break out and smoke to billow over the town.\nResidents in the area, including from across the Pennsylvania border just a quarter-mile away, were forced to evacuate from their homes. As fear grew of a possible explosion, crews at the crash site then facilitated a controlled release of the toxic chemicals, releasing them into the air and burning them. The excessive amounts of smoke, fire and toxic chemicals in the air have since buoyed residents' concerns about their health and when it's safe to return home.\nDeWine said Wednesday 'the company should pay for everything.' He added that he talked to the company's CEO on Tuesday, who assured him Norfolk would stay in the area until cleanup efforts are dealt with. The company has said publicly, too, that it will continue to assist with cleanup and fund remediation.\n'I said, \u2018there is concern with some people in East Palestine that you are going to leave before you get the cleanup done, you are going to leave before the problems are dealt with,'' DeWine said. 'He pledged to me, \u2018we're gonna stay.' We're going to hold them to what they said. We are going to hold them accountable.'\nWhen asked for comment on DeWine's statements about the company, a Norfolk Southern spokesperson referred POLITICO to a company press release from Tuesday where President and CEO Alan Shaw announced a new $1 million charitable fund as one component of its planned support of East Palestine.\n\"We are committed to East Palestine today and in the future,\" Shaw said. \"We will be judged by our actions. We are cleaning up the site in an environmentally responsible way, reimbursing residents affected by the derailment, and working with members of the community to identify what is needed to help East Palestine recover and thrive.\"\nDeWine had said last week it was safe for residents to return to their homes, as air quality testing has come back clean. But officials are advising residents who do return home to use bottled water, as the release of the chemicals affected local waterways \u2014 even killing about 3,500 fish.\nThe Republican governor said Wednesday that the 'air has remained good' in the area, and a test of water in the village from late Tuesday also came back fine. The next water test results are expected later Wednesday, he said, which will be made available to the public.\nEPA Administrator Michael Regan said Wednesday the department feels confident in the air quality levels in the area \u2014 as EPA has \"been on the ground since day one\" \u2014 and that it will support the state in their water quality monitoring efforts, as thousands of fish have died and people have reporting instances of eye burning. The EPA also plans to hold Norfolk Southern accountable for the derailment, Regan added.\n'We understand some of the anxiety of the community, but we are with the community,' the EPA administrator said. 'We're going to hold this company accountable, and we're going to be here until this problem is cleaned up.'\nMia McCarthy contributed to this report.",

    "excerpt": "In the Georgia budget adjustment for 2023, property owners due tax payout from surplus and workforce development is being targeted.",
    "summary": "Many Georgians could soon receive a tax refund - even those who have yet to file their 2022 returns.\nThe Georgia Senate is considering an amended 2022-2023 budget that calls for a homestead exemption for property owners. The legislation passed the Georgia House on Feb. 2. Once the $32.6 billion budget passes that chamber, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp can sign it into law.\nRead it: Georgia FY 2023 amended budget proposal:\nState tax collections have exceeded projections since July 2022, pushing the state's surplus to a record $6.6 billion. The amended budget adds nearly $2.4 billion in spending from the fiscal plan passed last spring.\nThe property tax exemptions would result in a $500 payout for property owners, on average. The refunds are a one-time payout and are not likely to be included again in the 2023-2024 budget, which is currently being drafted by the Georgia House.\nHere's what else is in the amended budget:\nGov. Kemp suspended Georgia's gasoline tax for much of 2022 as oil prices skyrocketing following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February. The United States and several other countries responded to Russia's aggression by boycotting that nation's oil exports, which disrupted supply and pushed prices above $4 a gallon for an extended period.\nThe gas tax is a major revenue source for Georgia transportation funding, and the tax's suspension resulted in a $1.1 billion shortfall. The amended budget backfills that gap.\nThe budget passed last April fully funded Georgia's K-12 education system under the quality basic education, or QBE, formula. The amended budget keeps those dollars in place and adds $60,000 school safety grants.\nThe House allocated funds to replace equipment related to voting devices, specifically battery backups for the machines, which have been in place for three years.\nCiting the impact of inflation on retirees, the amended budget calls for one-time bonuses of $250 to $300 for state government pensioners.\n'This region is perfect': A recap of how Hyundai made its way to the Savannah region\nWith rents and home prices reaching record levels across the state, the amended budget takes funds from a rural community economic development program, the OneGeorgia Authority and reallocates it to establish the Rural Workforce Housing Fund. The program's aim is to boost housing stock near recently announced economic development project, such as the Hyundai EV manufacturing facility under construction near Savannah.\nSpeaking of Hyundai, housing isn't the only issue related to the plant the amended budget will look to address. The plan calls for expansion of the Quick Start training center program that provides customized training for new, large-scale employers. Savannah is already home to a Quick Start center and another is planned next door to the Hyundai plant in Bryan County.\nQuick Start will also ramp up its programs to support the planned Rivian EV factory in Newton County outside of Atlanta.\nThese incentives are also aimed at areas near Hyundai and the other economic development projects and would help small businesses meant to support the large employers.\nThe Georgia House added these funds to the budget to upgrade security at these shelters, which predominantly serve battered women and their children.\nThis article originally appeared on Savannah Morning News: Georgia General Assembly: Here is the revised 2023 budget",

    "summary": "They're called 'super speeders,' and a metro area sheriff's official says they're on the rise.\nThese are drivers who go 75 miles per hour on a two-lane road or 85 miles per hour on the highway. The state fines super speeders and extra $200.\nLieutenant Scotty Spriggs of the Forsyth County Sheriff's Office told Channel 2\u2032s Brian Mims he's seeing more of these speeders on the road.\n'We could go out to (Georgia) 400 right now; if I had seven folks, we could all probably stop seven people doing 85 and above,' he said.\n[DOWNLOAD: Free WSB-TV News app for alerts as news breaks]\nWorking traffic along Georgia 400 Monday, he regularly clocked drivers in the 65 mph zone going more than 80 mph.\n'And then you got these folks that are doing 95, 100 miles an hour, and they're zipping in and out of traffic, that's creating a safety issue,' he said.\nHis message comes after a fellow deputy in December clocked a driver doing 70 miles an hour in a 35 mph zone. The driver failed to stop and reached speeds of more than 100 mph on Buford Highway and 144 mph on GA 400. Deputies safely stopped the car and the driver was arrested on several charges, including reckless driving and speeding.\n'Our position is obviously the safety of the general public,' Spriggs said. 'Are we chasing this car because of just the speed itself, or is it the reckless nature that this person has already exhibited \u2013 that he doesn't care about everybody else that's out here on the public roadways.'\nIn the December case, deputies used stop sticks and a precision immobilization technique also known as a PIT maneuver to stop the car.\nSpriggs said aside from high fines and criminal charges, excessive speeds can cause catastrophic crashes.\n'There is just no way that anything positive is going to come out of it,' he said. 'It's bad enough to have an accident, but the more speed you include in that collision, the body just cannot absorb that percussion,' he said. 'Cars can be replaced, people can't.'\nTRENDING STORIES:\nPolice: 17-year-old girl sprays classmates, staff with pepper spray after fight in hallway\n\u2018An amazing father, brother, friend & most importantly husband': Club co-owner dead after shooting\nPolice, construction crews moving into site of proposed APD training facility\nHe said the pandemic has likely played a role in higher numbers of super speeders. In the early days of the pandemic, traffic and enforcement were light.\n'With the roadways being pretty vacant, everybody was wide open,' he said. 'And it seems like that lull in enforcement activities has carried over to now.'\nSpriggs knows there are habitual speeders out there. He said modern cars are quieter and smoother, making it easier to speed.\n'But when you're knocking up to 100 miles an hour, and you're passing cars like a picket fence, it's one of those things where you got to stop and think just a second about checking your speed,' he said. 'All it requires is a little bit of paying attention and slowing down yourself, being cognizant of your surroundings.'\n[SIGN UP: WSB-TV Daily Headlines Newsletter]\nIN OTHER NEWS:",

    "summary": "Stonebranch was recognized by Gartner for the third time in a row for its Universal Automation Center (UAC)\nService orchestration and automation platforms (SOAPs)\nALPHARETTA, Ga., Jan. 31, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \u00a0Stonebranch, a leading provider of service orchestration and automation solutions, announced today that it has been named a Representative Vendor in the 2023 Gartner Market Guide for Service Orchestration and Automation Platforms (SOAP).*\n'Our recognition by Gartner in all three years of the SOAP Market Guide is truly an honor,' said Guiseppe Damiani, CEO at Stonebranch. 'I'm proud to say that our end-users and partners have worked side by side with Stonebranch to drive true innovation. They haven't just adopted the cloud. They have fine-tuned their operations with a fully orchestrated mix of on-premises and cloud environments. Not only are they automating in real-time, but they've developed new methods to automate IT Ops, DataOps, DevOps, CloudOps, and business processes.'\nThe SOAP category, which was born in 2020 as an evolution from traditional on-premises workload automation, represents the market's shift toward hybrid IT environments. According to the Gartner report, 'Existing workload automation strategies are unable to cope with the expansion in complexity of workload types, volumes, and locations driven by evolving business demands.' Gartner predicts that 'By year-end 2025, 80% of organizations currently delivering workload automation will be using SOAPs to orchestrate workloads across IT and business domains.'\nThe Stonebranch Universal Automation Center (UAC) is a modern, real-time IT automation and orchestration platform. By centrally automating tasks, managing workflows, and orchestrating IT processes across different platforms and business applications, UAC helps organizations achieve better business outcomes. Cloud migrations, self-service infrastructure provisioning, jobs-as-code for DevOps, data pipeline management, and more, are all possible with UAC's future-proof approach.\nRead the 2023 Gartner Market Guide for Service Orchestration and Automation Platforms report, courtesy of Stonebranch.\n* 'Gartner, Market Guide for Service Orchestration and Automation Platforms,' Chris Saunderson, Daniel Betts, Hassan Ennaciri, January 23, 2023.\nGartner Disclaimer\nGARTNER is a registered trademark and service mark of Gartner, Inc. and/or its affiliates in the U.S. and internationally and is used herein with permission.

    "summary": "The post FLO Honor the Original 'Fly Girl,' with a Little Help from Missy Elliott Herself: Stream appeared first on Consequence.\nIf you didn't believe us when we said British R&B trio FLO are a rising act to watch, maybe you'll take Missy Elliott's word for it. The iconic rapper-singer guests on the group's new song 'Fly Girl,' inspired by the Supa Dupa Fly artist herself.\nDespite its name, 'Fly Girl' actually references (and samples) another Elliott song, 2002's 'Work It.' 'If you a fly girl, get your nails done, get a pedicure, get your hair did,' FLO sing, before adding their own original flair: 'You're telling me I'm pretty but it's obvious/ I don't need a man to tell me where the party is.' Blending old school hip-hop production with R&B vocals, the song instantly becomes an empowering girls night anthem \u2014 and that's before Missy lays down a verse of her own.\n'\u2018Fly Girl' is all about confidence, good vibes and feeling your best,' FLO said in a statement. 'It's a lively, feel-good song that still incorporates clever lyrics and fire vocals, if we do say so ourselves. It's quite literally a perfect fusion of old-school meets modern-day R&B, with a nod to and feature from the original fly girl Missy Elliott herself. We love it and are so happy to be putting out a song that can hopefully make whoever plays it feel confident and most importantly, FLY.'\nFLO members Jorja Douglas, Stella Quaresma, and Ren\u00e9e Downer broke out last year with the single 'Cardboard Box,' and their rising fame quickly caught the attention of Elliott. 'I remember a few of their fans sent me clips of their performances, and I immediately felt the authentic '90s vibe,' the artist recalled. 'I loved the fact they all sang lead so well \u2014 great vocal control \u2014 so when I was asked to be a part of the \u2018Fly Girl' record, it was a no brainer.' Watch the singers team up in the track's Tajana Tokyo-directed music video below.\nSince coming up with 'Cardboard Box,' FLO have shared the EP The Lead.\u00a0The group has tour dates coming up across North America, Europe, and Asia.

    "excerpt": "Leon and other counties previously in the Central Time Zone would be an hour behind those with whom they now shared the Eastern zone.",
    "summary": "On Tuesday, March 19, 1918, in the middle of World War I, President Woodrow Wilson signed into law Daylight Saving Time which took effect on March 31.\nReferred to as 'fast time' or 'war time,' Daylight Saving Time (DST) required households to set their clocks forward one hour on the last Sunday in March and then turn them back one hour on the last Sunday in October.\nThe primary reasons for the bill were to make better use of natural light to increase the length of the working day; save on 'illuminants' like oil and gas; conserve coal, especially during the winter months; and improve training conditions for America's fighting forces.\n\nDining with a view:16 of our favorite waterfront restaurants around the Panhandle and Forgotten Coast\nThis year, Daylight Saving Time begins Sunday, March 12.\nPromoters of DST touted that the additional hour of daylight would give people more time outdoors for gardening or recreational purposes, which would be a boon to national health.\nAccording to news reports, the time change would not cause 'the slightest disorganization or impairment of existing conditions' in daily life. On Saturday night, March 30, every household would simply set its clock 'forward one hour, go to sleep,' and forget about Daylight Saving Time until the last Saturday in October.\nApparently, folks in Tallahassee and Leon County offered few or no complaints; at least, none were reported in the Daily Democrat.\nAt the time the bill became law, the line separating the Eastern and Central Time Zones followed Longitude 83 through Detroit, Live Oak, Florida, and south through the Gulf of Mexico just west of Tampa. This placed Leon County in the Central Time Zone.\nHowever, the boundaries complicated the schedules of transcontinental railroads, so, at the recommendation of the Inter-State Commerce Commission, they were redrawn and moved slightly westward.\nThe new line between the two zones would run through Franklin, North Carolina; Atlanta, Macon, Americus, Albany, and Thomasville, Georgia; and in Florida, through River Junction (Chattahoochee) and down the Apalachicola River to the Gulf. This meant that all Florida counties, including Leon, east of the Apalachicola River, would belocated in the Eastern Time Zone.\nMeanwhile, it also meant that Leon and other counties previously in the Central Time Zone would be an hour behind those with whom they now shared the Eastern zone.\nWise heads proffered that the situation could be rectified if folks in that part of Florida did not turn their clocks back an hour in October 1918, but did move them ahead one hour on March 31, 1919.\nThe new boundaries went into effect on Jan. 1, 1919, but even after March 31 some in Tallahassee, including the City Council, still remained on Central Time. Mayor Guyte B. McCord declared the situation had the town in a state of utter confusion. Some businesses, offices, and the trains passing through Tallahassee, 'used one time,' andother residents and businesses used another.\nEven the 'city time piece' appeared to be confused; on April 2, the Democrat reported that the town clock struck seven when it was only two in the afternoon.\nOn April 12, McCord and the City Council concluded that the only way to solve the dilemma was for everyone in Tallahassee to observe only 'one time.'\nOn April 14, 1919, the mayor issued a Proclamation declaring that Tallahassee was officially in the Eastern Time Zone, and from 'twelve o'clock noon' that day the city would recognize only 'Eastern Time Zone Day Light Saving Time' as the 'official time' in Tallahassee.\nMary Cathrin May is a former teacher and Tallahassee historian.\nThis article originally appeared on Tallahassee Democrat: Tallahassee got off to confusing Daylight Saving Time start in 1918",

    "summary": "Following the release of their new single '(You) On My Arm' last Friday, rising Winnipeg singer, songwriter, and artist Leith Ross reveals their spring 2023 headline tour dates across North America, UK, and Europe.\nThe tour kicks off in Bristol on April 11 and makes stops at London's Lafayette on April 17, Los Angeles' Lodge Room on May 23, Brooklyn's Music Hall of Williamsburg on June 6, Toronto's The Danforth Music Hall on June 10 and more. Tickets will go on sale via pre-sale beginning tomorrow at 10am local time and via general on-sale on Friday, February 17 at 10am local time. Tickets will be available through the artist's official website.\nOn the meaning behind their latest release '(You) On My Arm,' Leith declares, 'This song is about having a massive crush on someone. It happens, fortunately and unfortunately. I hope it can help with any yearning you may feel the need to do. That's what it has done for me. I love being gay.'\n'(You) On My Arm' is Leith's first release of 2023 and follows their previous viral singles 'We'll Never Have Sex' and 'Orlando.' The breakout 'We'll Never Have Sex' has amassed over 37 million Spotify streams and 1 million video views to date.

Recorded live, they made their debut with the independent 'Motherwell' EP in 2020. Beyond prominent editorial playlisting, it incited widespread critical applause across US and Canada. Leith maintained this momentum in 2021 with the 'I'd Have To Think About It,' EP the title track has notably amassed nearly 12 million Spotify streams to date.

    "excerpt": "Over 100 years after a campaign of racial terror drove Black people from Forsyth County, Ga., the county is making strides toward becoming a more diverse community. But some residents believe that in\u2026",
    "summary": "CUMMING, Ga. \u2014 Driving through present-day Forsyth County is like navigating an American landscape haunted by its history. Centuries-old churches and storied cemeteries carry remnants of past lives, of a Black community vanquished by racial terror. Atop several acres of land sit 20th-century-built homes, housing generations of Forsythians.\nThe county, located 30 miles north of Atlanta and home to about 235,000 residents, presents itself as an ideal place to live and raise a family. The affluent suburb champions its high-performing public schools, growing diverse community and promise of a better life.\nBut beneath the surface of this vibrant community is a deep and complex history rooted in hate.\nWhile 1 in 3 residents in Forsyth County are people of color, only about 4.9% of the population is Black, a figure that's been stagnant for four decades. This is due in large part to a massive racial cleansing that rocked the county in 1912, followed by 75 years when Black people were banned from moving back in.\nNow the county is grappling with its failure to fully confront that dark past \u2014 a potential impediment to its progress. It's a failure that extends from Forsyth's schools, where there is no established core curriculum on the events of 1912, to its residents, some of whom are content with how the county is moving forward and others who are hoping for a real reckoning.\n'Forsyth County is right on the borderline between Atlanta's influence and rural Georgia,' poet, author and former county resident Patrick Phillips told Yahoo News. 'It's also on the border between everything we hope will change about the way the country remembers the past and then another group of people who don't want to talk about any of that.'\nFollowing Reconstruction, the 12 years after the Civil War, Forsyth County was home to about 12,000 residents, including a relatively small but growing population of Black people, dozens of whom were landowners. Newly freed Black Americans were just beginning to confront a world where opportunity and hope were possible.\nBut in September 1912, everything changed when an 18-year-old white woman named Mae Crow was found beaten, bloodied and unconscious in the Georgia woods under mysterious circumstances. She later died from her injuries, and three young Black men \u2014 the only Black people in that part of the county at the time \u2014 were accused of raping and murdering her, with little evidence other than a coerced confession from one of them.\nAs a result, 24-year-old Rob Edwards was arrested and jailed for the crime, and soon afterward was dragged from his cell by a mob of angry white residents. His body was riddled with bullets and beaten with crowbars, then allegedly hitched onto the back of a wagon with a noose around his neck and eventually hanged in the Cumming town square.\nPeople took turns stoning and shooting more bullets at his limp corpse as hundreds of onlookers rejoiced. Two Black teens, Ernest Knox, 16, and Oscar Daniel, 18, were later hanged after expedient one-day trials that led to an onslaught of racial violence and terror toward the county's Black residents.\nBy the year's end, all of the county's 1,098 Black residents \u2014 or 10% of the population \u2014 were violently forced out as Black churches were set ablaze, threatening fliers made by white vigilantes were circulated and night riders made life torture for anyone in the community who was not white, particularly its Black sharecroppers and business owners.\nMany Black residents who owned homes were unable to sell their properties in enough time, devastating entire families. And in many ways, Black life in the county has never fully recovered.\n'I cannot imagine what it must have felt like to have night riders coming through these Black neighborhoods and burning people's houses and forcing them out,' 71-year-old Elon Osby told Yahoo News. Osby, whose grandparents William and Ida Bagley owned over 60 acres of land in Forsyth in 1912 before having to leave it all behind, added: 'The fear is unimaginable. But then to leave your land with no opportunity to be compensated for it, that's the next unimaginable thing.'\nToday, Osby says, several half-million-dollar subdivision homes sit on the land her grandparents once owned. The family never received anything for it.\nA newspaper headline in the Atlanta Constitution around that time read: 'Negroes Flee From Forsyth: Enraged White People Are Driving Blacks From County.'\nThe county remained all white for more than seven decades after the 1912 expulsion, with comprehensive details about the systematic removal of Black residents buried in old articles and history books for decades.\n'The white community in Forsyth had successfully kind of buried a lot of this, and there was some knowledge of it as kind of mythic, but they had largely buried their heads in the sand,' said Phillips, who wrote the 2016 book 'Blood at the Root: A Racial Cleansing in America.' The book documents the white supremacist uprising in Forsyth County and how, despite thousands of witnesses of the lynchings of the three men, no one was ever held accountable for their deaths.\nBut depending on who you talk to now, the specifics of what led to Black residents fleeing vary, as some people seemingly contort their version of the truth into something more savory. Some white residents, whose families go back at least several generations in the county, say the mass exile was partly voluntary.\n'There were probably many different scenarios as to why people left,' George Pirkle, a historian with the Historical Society of Cumming/Forsyth County, told Yahoo News. Pirkle's family in the county dates back to at least the 1830s. He was born there in 1947 and says his first 'meaningful' interaction with a Black person didn't come until he went to college at the University of Georgia nearly two decades later.\n'For this exodus that happened, it's hard to think it was anyone local that was involved in the terrorism, because you wouldn't want to mess with the economy,' he said. Regardless, he added that 'one lynching is a thousand too many.'\nA plaque and jar of soil to commemorate the lynching of Edwards sit in the historical society's library.\nMartha McConnell, the society's co-founder, added that 'Forsyth County was the least likely county where you would think there would be a racial incident.'\nIt wasn't until 1987, the 75th anniversary of 1912, that news of the racial cleansing in the community spread across the U.S. That's when activists, led by Atlanta Councilman Hosea Williams, marched to the city of Cumming to bring awareness to Forsyth's racist history.\nBut even then, less than 40 years ago, the activists were met with a bevy of white residents chanting the N-word, throwing rocks and waving signs that read \"Keep Forsyth white.\" Eventually, the activists were forced to board their buses and return to Atlanta.\nMcConnell contends that most of the agitators were outsiders from as far away as Indiana who came into town looking to start trouble. 'We couldn't recognize anyone in those pictures,' she said, noting that members of the historical society went out and wrote down numbers of vehicle licenses that weren't registered in the county.\nPhillips says the hatred among the local white population, both in 1912 and 1987, was widespread.\nAs a curious high school junior in 1987, Phillips says, he went to the Cumming town square to see what the large crowd forming was all about and soon found himself in the middle of a Ku Klux Klan rally.\n'It was kind of like a horror movie,' he said. 'I had always known there were some racists in the county, but suddenly they were parading around with nooses on the town square where I had gotten school supplies every September. \u2026 So I wanted to get away from there, because I was pretty shocked.'\nToday, in a show of progress, the county has made significant steps to grapple with its past. A historical marker now sits in the same town square where Edwards's body was once hanged. A new elementary school, named New Hope, opened in August to honor the former African American schools in the region. And in recent years, members of the community have held various panels about the 1912 lynching.\nBut where some have embraced the county's past evils in attempts to chart a better path forward, others have tried to ignore the history altogether.\n'It's like two different trains on two different tracks,' Phillips said. 'Progress is happening in one area, and at the same time things are going in reverse in another, all in the same place. And that's Forsyth County.'\nBefore Phillips's book was published in 2016, residents say few people in and around Forsyth knew exactly why it wasn't a welcome place for Black people. There was a kind of unspoken agreement, especially for Black Georgians, that the county remained for whites only because of tensions from the 1987 march, but there was nothing concrete until the book put everything in perspective. Even so, a large portion of the population doesn't know about the county's history.\n'A lot of people know something bad happened in 1912, but they don't know exactly what it was,' longtime Forsyth resident Durwood Snead, a former pastor, told Yahoo News. 'I think the average person doesn't know it all.'\nNow groups like Leadership Forsyth, made up of volunteers from the community who promote diversity through educational experiences, have made headway in distilling the previous harm in the county by carrying out various projects like cleaning public parks, renovating community rooms and creating a mobile food pantry. One of the group's most visible projects, completed in 2022, was the restoration of the Tolbert Street Cemetery, a former African American cemetery first used as a family burial ground in the mid-1800s before the site housed the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church until 1912. It remains unclear whether the church that was once built on the property was burned down.\nA dedicated group of six pastors, including Snead, also began a scholarship last year for the descendants of Black Forsythians who were forced from their homes. In getting buy-in from the community, because the four-year $10,000 annual scholarships are entirely donation-based, Snead made it clear that it's 'not a handout, it's love.' In its first year the scholarship already had nine recipients, including Osby's grandson.\n'The truth sets everyone free,' Snead, co-founder of the African American Descendants of Forsyth County Scholarship, said. 'We need to learn about the past so we can do something different for the future.'\nHe recalls having to tell skeptical residents, 'This is not reparations. If we can show an act of love to give people hope and show others to do the same, then it's great.'\nSnead, who moved to Forsyth in 1989, says it has seen growth. He recalls only 14 Black people living in the county of 42,000 people back then. More than three decades later, the county has ballooned to nearly a quarter of a million. Its evolution in that time, Snead says, is in part due to the fact that in the 1980s just 10% 'outsiders,' or those without generations in the area, lived in Forsyth, compared with 90% 'outsiders' today.\n'When we moved here in 1989, it was the country \u2014 a rural area of Atlanta,' he said. 'It's grown like crazy with everything, and diversity along with it. \u2026 It's changed in every way.'\nBut for many residents the progress has been moderate at best. In the Cumming town center, merely 30 feet away from the placards acknowledging the 1912 lynching, sits a harrowing statue of Hiram Parks Bell, a Confederate leader, slave owner and, as Phillips wrote, 'unrepentant white supremacist.' And in recent years, stories of local middle school students sharing lynching references and racial epithets, and a Black mom mysteriously found dead after a party with white women, summon up feelings of an old Forsyth divided by race.\n'There are a lot of markers that remind people historically of what this county is,' Daniel Blackman, a leader in the Black community of Forsyth, told Yahoo News, adding that the county's challenges mainly stem from a failure to uniformly address the past.\nThe land the county sits on today was inhabited by Cherokee Indians until its founding in 1832, when it was named after John Forsyth, a 19th century politician and slave owner.\nBlackman in 2016 was the first Black person to run for office in Forsyth. He lost his bid for the Georgia state Senate, but he says he was encouraged by moments of solace while campaigning. Like when a Donald Trump supporter from the community thanked him for merely knocking on his door, saying that no one else had ever taken the time to show they cared about his vote. Eventually, Blackman's sign was affixed on the man's lawn next to a Trump sign.\nIn April 2022, Blackman was appointed by President Biden as EPA administrator for the Southeast.\nUnderstanding the challenges of the community, Blackman moved to Forsyth in 2013 in hopes of being a big part of the change.\n'I came intentionally because I had three Black boys at the time. Now I have a daughter,' he said, noting that he made his presence known with several countywide organizations.\n'I knew the history of 1987. I knew the history of 1912. \u2026 I moved because I felt like if we're going to be a transformative community, we needed to be present and we needed to open doors that, quite frankly, weren't being opened, and have conversations that might make people uncomfortable.'\nHe acknowledges that the small number of Black residents in the county have come for varying reasons.\n'Some Black folks are up here because they can afford it,' he said. 'Some Black folks are up here because of the school district. And then other Black folks moved here because they are blending in, and for whatever personal reasons they have. \u2026 The challenge I've had from the time I've been in Forsyth County as it relates to the history is that 90% of people think that if you stop talking about it, it'll go away.\n'At the end of the day, there has to be something said about how things come together and unfold over time and how you choose to deal with it,' he said.\nBlackman believes that if it were not for his own teachings within the home, his children would not be as knowledgeable of the Black history that has taken place in their own backyard \u2014 something critics, including students, have raised concerns about in the past.\nDamian Galvan, a politically active high school student in Forsyth County, wrote a guest column for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution in 2021 imploring the district to teach more about the county's racist past instead of trying to ignore it.\n'Forsyth County has been notorious for its historic racism,' he wrote. 'Many people suggest times have changed since then, but the consequences of not teaching the impact of the past on the present say otherwise.' He pointed to an incident in 2020 in which a student drove by a crowd protesting police brutality and yelled racially insensitive rhetoric.\n'Change does not roll in on the wheels of inevitability; rather, it moves in the chambers of our county's Board of Education, channels through crowds that engage in peaceful protest,' Galvan wrote.\nThe county's education centers enroll about 51,000 students across 47 public schools, including the elementary school whose name pays tribute to African American schools that were in Forsyth before its Black residents were expelled. Just over 52% of students are white, and 48% are students of color. The county expects students of color to be the majority in the next year or so.\nIn schools, K-12 students across Georgia learn about history, or social studies, through the Georgia Standards of Excellence, which, according to Forsyth's education website, pr",

    "excerpt": "While discussing Michael B. Jordan playfully confronting a reporter he went to school with, Budden said, 'That was corny, though. See that's the problem, it's not enough n**gas keeping it real in\u2026",
    "summary": "On the latest episode of 'Drink Champs,' N.O.R.E. and DJ EFN sat down with the multitalented Joe Budden to discuss rumors regarding him beefing with JAY-Z, firing Rory and Mal, calling Michael B. Jordan corny, and Slaughterhouse, among other topics.\nBorn in Harlem, New York, Budden became a prominent name in the hip hop community, initially earning recognition as a rapper before transitioning into a successful media personality. Budden began his music career in the early 2000s, releasing several mixtapes that garnered attention. His eponymous debut album\u00a0was released in 2003 under Def Jam Recordings, featuring the hit single 'Pump It Up,' which peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and received a Grammy nomination for Best Male Rap Solo Performance.\nThroughout his rap career, Budden released multiple solo projects, including his Mood Muzik mixtape series and the No Love Lost album. He also became a founding member of the hip hop supergroup Slaughterhouse, alongside Royce da 5'9\u2033, Joell Ortiz, and KXNG Crooked. The group released two studio albums, 2009's Slaughterhouse and 2012's Welcome to: Our House, before disbanding in 2018.\nAs he transitioned into media, Budden launched 'The Joe Budden Podcast' in 2015. Initially named 'I'll Name This Podcast Later,' the show quickly gained popularity, discussing music, culture, and current events with co-hosts Rory and Mal. In 2018, 'The Joe Budden Podcast' signed an exclusive deal with Spotify, helping to solidify its place as a leading platform in the hip hop and entertainment space. Since then, Budden has gone completely independent and picked up two new co-hosts, Lamar 'Ice' Burney and Antwan 'Ish' Marby.\nTo give fans a comprehensive look at Budden's career and accomplishments, REVOLT compiled a list of eight facts we learned from his 'Drink Champs' interview. Keep scrolling to discover more about his rise to fame and impact on the culture, and remember to watch the full episode here.\nBudden has claimed that after his first hit 'Pump It Up' broke into the mainstream charts in 2003, he wanted JAY-Z to be a part of the remix. According to Budden, Hov's rate for a verse was $250,000 at the time, which he couldn't afford as a new artist. In the end, JAY released a freestyle over the song, which many saw as a dig at Budden.\n'At the time, I'm not ranting nowhere. I don't even know how to receive that, I just know that I don't have $250,000. I think Webb put the battery in my back to do that,' Budden shared. He jokingly added, 'I just seen this n**ga last week, why we talking about 20 years ago? And you know what else I be hating on? That [N.O.R.E.] get to talk about JAY-Z like that. You get to say, \u2018Hov is petty.' I try not to talk about none of them n**gas like that \u2018cause I don't want that call.'\nWhile speaking on the podcast host, Charlamagne Tha God commented that Budden 'knows his worth, but doesn't know how to properly negotiate it' after his Spotify exclusivity deal came to an end. Afterward, Budden responded, saying, '[Charlamagne] appeared to go out of his way to devalue me.' As a result, the two haven't been on good terms, trading shots at one another over the past year. 'Nothing, we just hate each other. It's fake, it's not a real hate,' Budden joked.\nBudden has had a long and varied career in podcasting, which began with his first program, 'I'll Name This Podcast Later,' co-hosted with Marisa Mendez. It quickly gained a following, thanks to Budden's frank discussions about the music industry, his personal life, and current events. Then, the entertainer launched 'The Joe Budden Podcast,' which has since become a mainstay in the social commentary space.\n'If we're going back to the early days of content, I started at HOT 97 in \u201804 I want to say. In 2010, I had my own solo show that I was just uploading to iTunes called \u2018It's My F**king Show.' Joe Budden TV, I started that in 2007 or 2006, and that went as long as it went,' Budden stated. 'You had to be down with a gang to get monetization\u2026 Once you find out that there's coin to be had, and you start to make calls and you see how protective people are over certain avenues. When I started my podcast, there was nothing to be presented because what was anybody doing?'\nPodcasts have been popular for a while now but as time goes on, more and more musicians, like Budden, Noreaga, and Yung Miami, are starting their own shows. Given that radio hosts and personalities dominated the audio space years prior, it makes sense that several already-established names would take advantage of new talent coming up. According to Budden, Peter Rosenberg tried to produce his podcast before it took off.\nBudden stated, 'He was trying to produce me, but I'm difficult to produce. I'm a producer. I'm watching to see what you produce and if you're not producing, then I can produce that.' He continued, 'Rosenberg saw a talent and acted on an idea. He clearly was right.'\nSince 'The Joe Budden Podcast' had a brief pause in 2021, Budden's relationship with Rory and Mal has been tense, to say the least. After being fired on air for wanting ownership of the show, the two personalities signed with SiriusXM's Stitcher to start a new weekly podcast later that summer. They have continued their feud since then, even resorting to subtle jabs at one another. 'Once we're not associated anymore, everybody is free to do whatever they want to do,' Budden shared.\n'The version that went to the public is I was stealing. They thought I was stealing,' he stated. 'I have nothing negative to say about anybody. I like that everybody is where they want to be, doing what they want to do with the people that they want to do it with. I support that for everybody.'\nBudden continued, 'You gotta remember, this happened two years ago. I've done the interviews, they've done the interviews. It's been hearsay. There's been he say, she say. You bump into people at parties, you bump into people at clubs, and there's been mutuals. There is nothing to say about those gentlemen today. I hope they're doing what they want to do and I hope they're doing it well.'\nAfter hosting 'The Breakfast Club' on Power 105.1 for 12 years, Angela Yee left the show in 2022 and started her own. Having experience with business breakups, whether it be his own podcast or The Joe Budden Network, N.O.R.E. asked Budden what his take on the situation was. 'I wish her the greatest. I f**k with Angela. I hope the show wins,' he shared.\n'I did the \u2018F**k you' part of the Joe Budden experience already. I said f**k you to everybody that was outside that you could possibly say f**k you to. My 40s and 50s, I don't want to live that way,' Budden added.\nBudden, Joell Ortiz, KXNG Crooked, and Royce Da 5'9\u2033 came together in 2008 to create Slaughterhouse, which has released two albums to date. The group's self-titled debut was released in 2009, then three years later, they dropped\u00a0Welcome To: Our House. Unfortunately, they dissolved with Crooked claiming that Budden was the reason for their next album being delayed due to him being signed to another label at the time.\n'Come on, give me the blame, I'll take it. I ruined everything. Everything that you loved, I ruined that s**t,' Budden stated. He also explained, 'I wish I could tell you how much goes into making an album. All of the blood, sweat, tears, equity, lonely nights, hungry nights, and sleepless nights that go into an album. I'm saying if I do it again, it's certainly not going to be because of the fans. Like my son asked me for a verse. I thought that was fly, I didn't do it.'\nAt the Atlanta screening of Creed III, Michael B. Jordan confronted media personality Lore'l, a former classmate who he claimed called him 'corny' during their high school days. After the clip went viral online, Budden addressed the moment on his podcast and said, 'You doing that to a girl is some corny n**ga s**t.' As expected, the rapper received plenty of backlash with peers and users alike bringing up some of his controversial moments in the past.\n'I do not have beef with Michael B. Jordan,' Budden told N.O.R.E. and EFN.\u00a0'If it did come off that way, wouldn't that just be good podcasting? I walked the s**t back, too, like damn, that n**ga seems too invested. That was corny, though. See that's the problem, it's not enough n**gas keeping it real in entertainment because it's entertainment,' he doubled down. 'If any one of us doubled back to diss the chick from seventh grade while we up, they're going to call us corny. It's not deep.'",

    "excerpt": "Historic amounts of household goods and online impulse buys flooded U.S. ports in 2021, as the pandemic drove a surge in e-commerce sales and spurred more home-improvement projects.",
    "summary": "Historic amounts of household goods and online impulse buys flooded U.S. ports in 2021, as the pandemic drove a surge in e-commerce sales and spurred more home-improvement projects. Millions of metal containers full of furniture, power tools, cotton sweatpants and weighted blankets sailed to America's shores on the decks of large container ships \u2014 all of which burned fossil fuels as they plied oceans and harbors.\nA new report aims to quantify the environmental toll of transporting all of those products by sea. The analysis, released on Wednesday by the Ship It Zero coalition, tracks goods imported by 18 major retailers and consumer brands during that frenzied year. It then estimates the planet-warming emissions and air pollutants associated with each container.\nResearchers found that, in 2021, importing 4.7 million containers on more than 1,650 ships generated 3.5 million metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. That's roughly equivalent to carbon dioxide emissions from 754,000 typical gas-powered cars in a year. At the same time, ships spewed enough smog-forming nitrogen oxide to equal the annual emissions of seven coal-fired power plants.\nWalmart, Target and Home Depot \u2014 purveyors of practically everything that fills a home \u2014 accounted for the bulk of emissions analyzed in the study. The companies represented the first, second and third largest shares, respectively, of both climate-harming emissions and air pollution from maritime imports.\nMany of those goods moved through just a handful of hubs: the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach in California, the Port of Houston in Texas and the Port of Savannah in Georgia.\n\"You had this skyrocketing e-commerce demand and, because of that, port communities experienced this enormous wave of pollution,' Madeline Rose, climate campaign director at Pacific Environment and the report's lead author, told Canary Media. 'This report is the first of its kind that conducts a deep-dive analysis on retail pollution in specific U.S. ports.'\nShe said the campaign urges 'all companies that continue to rely on fossil-fueled ocean freight services to abandon dirty ships now and compete to put their goods on the world's first zero-emissions vessels.' Such ships could feature marine batteries, fuel cells and wind-harnessing devices \u2014 technologies that exist at small scales today \u2014 to meet some of their energy needs, while potentially also relying on emerging 'green' fuels like methanol, hydrogen or ammonia from renewable electricity.\nShip It Zero, of which Pacific Environment is a founding member, commissioned the report's research from Stand.earth Research Group. The organization provided data including records on individual vessel movements and detailed shipment lists. University Maritime Advisory Services (UMAS), a prominent research consultancy in London, estimated the fuel consumption and emissions for each vessel contained in the study and linked those numbers to specific retailers.\nWednesday's study was initially envisioned as a follow-up to an earlier analysis of 2019 data, which was itself a first-of-its-kind effort to trace retailers' shipping-related emissions. However, last summer UMAS researchers realized that a coding mistake had incorrectly inflated the first study's results. As a result of fixing the code, the emissions numbers in the new analysis are significantly lower by comparison.\nJames Stewart, a consultant for UMAS, said the error reflects the difficulties of culling data sets from many disparate companies and countries, in varying formats and units, and aligning the numbers to make apples-to-apples comparisons. Because retail giants and cargo carriers don't report such detailed emissions figures, researchers are left piecing the puzzle together.\n'We do want [companies] to take responsibility for these emissions calculations themselves,' Stewart said.\n'It's really useful to see the scale of the emissions of all these different retailers,' he added. 'It's clearly having impacts on local populations, in terms of health, and on climate change globally.'\nInternational shipping accounts for roughly 3 percent of greenhouse gas emissions every year, though experts say it could rise to 17 percent by 2050 if more diesel-burning ships make more voyages, and as other sectors reduce their fossil fuel consumption over time. Vessels are also major sources of air pollution, which tends to concentrate in waterfront communities, threatening people's health.\nWalmart, the world's largest retail company, represented more than one-fifth of the carbon dioxide emissions generated across the 18 companies in 2021, according to Ship It Zero.\nThe Bentonville, Arkansas\u2013based retailer, which earned over $611 billion in total revenue last fiscal year, was responsible for 788,000 metric tons of CO2, as well as 14.9 metric tons of the potent greenhouse gas methane. Much of its import-related air pollution accumulated in the Port of Houston, which operates terminals along the Houston Ship Channel \u2014 and is already one of the country's busiest and most polluted waterways.\nWalmart says it is working to reduce or avoid 1 billion metric tons of greenhouse gas emissions in the global value chain by 2030. 'Reducing emissions from ocean carriers is a priority for Walmart, and we work closely with logistics partners, NGOs and suppliers across the retail industry to scale up more sustainable approaches to transporting products,' a representative said by email.Other retailers have set more specific targets for addressing shipping emissions. Target has pledged to move its products off of fossil-burning ocean freighters by 2040. In late September, the Minneapolis-based company joined Cargo Owners for Zero Emission Vessels, an initiative of the Aspen Institute that includes other giant companies such as Amazon, Ikea, Unilever and Michelin.\nThe retailer produced an estimated 544,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions and 10 metric tons of ultra-warming methane from its U.S. imports in 2021, the report states.\nTarget made its clean-shipping commitment just weeks after the Minneapolis City Council unanimously passed a Ship It Zero resolution, which urges retailers to make all imports on '100% zero-emission ships' by 2030, and to disclose their maritime greenhouse gas emissions in public annual reports. The cities of Los Angeles and Long Beach, home to the nation's largest port complex, also adopted the resolution.\nOf all the retailers surveyed, Target imported the most goods through the Southern California hub, which itself represented the largest share \u2014 some 35 percent \u2014 of the total carbon emissions in 2021. That same year, the region also saw a dramatic spike in nitrogen oxide emissions and carcinogenic particulate matter from ships idling their engines as they waited to enter crowded ports.\n'Our big takeaway is that Los Angeles\u2013Long Beach, which is still managing the lion's share of these imports, has the responsibility to move fastest and set the course for a zero-emission future for U.S. ports,' Rose said. For their part, the ports are working on converting cargo-handling equipment to zero-emissions technologies by 2030 while also partnering with authorities in Shanghai and Singapore to establish green-fuel hubs.\nThe No. 3 polluter on Ship It Zero's list, Home Depot, was responsible for nearly 420,000 metric tons of carbon emissions and 8 metric tons of methane in 2021. The Atlanta-based retailer's preferred port, in Savannah, is also one of the nation's fastest-growing hubs, with plans to expand its container-handling capacity by 60 percent in the next few years.\nA spokesperson for Home Depot said the home-improvement giant works with its strategic partners 'to identify opportunities and encourage sustainable shipping solutions as they're available. For example, one of our largest carriers, Maersk, recently announced a commitment to net-zero emissions by 2040.'\nAs environmental groups push major retail importers and ship operators to ditch fossil fuels, it's not entirely clear which fuels and technologies the companies will use instead.\nNearly two dozen vessels now use sails, kites, suction wings and other forms of wind-assisted propulsion, a number that's expected to reach 50 ships by the end of 2023. Hundreds of ships now use batteries to power onboard equipment or drive electric motors. A handful of vessels, including a ferry coming soon to the San Francisco Bay, are powered by hydrogen fuel cells.\nBut those technologies aren't expected to fully replace the massive diesel engines that power today's enormous oceangoing vessels. Experts say ammonia \u2014 a pungent, carbonless compound \u2014 could become the leading fuel source for the world's giant cargo ships by 2050. However, engineers are still developing the engines and fuel cells that will be able to use ammonia, and only tiny amounts of the fuel are produced today using renewable electricity.\nIn the near term, more ships may come to burn methanol. While not entirely carbon-free, the chemical can be made using electricity (e-methanol) or be produced from plant biomass (bio-methanol). Crucially, it can work as a 'drop-in' replacement for oil-based fuels with relatively minor adjustments to a ship's engine and fuel system.\nMaersk, one of the world's largest container carriers, has ordered 19 vessels with engines capable of running on methanol. The Danish shipping giant also signed agreements with six fuel producers with the goal of sourcing at least 730,000 metric tons of 'green' methanol per year by the end of 2025. Other shipping companies have ordered a couple dozen more vessels, though, as is the case with green ammonia, demand for renewably produced methanol currently far outpaces the actual supply.\n'The methanol engine is there; the ammonia engine is being developed but is not there,' Johan Byskov Svendsen, program manager for the Maersk McKinney M\u00f8ller Center for Zero Carbon Shipping, said in a January webinar. 'If someone is decarbonizing and has a very, very short timeframe\u2026they will have to choose methanol.'\nRose, of Pacific Environment, said Maersk's methanol push shows how major companies, including U.S. retailers, can use their clout to help transform the global shipping industry. 'There's no excuse for them not to make these [clean-shipping] commitments and begin to extend their climate commitments to the seas,' she said.",

    "excerpt": "Twenty states have enacted laws restricting rights to peaceful protest, as environmentalists are increasingly criminalized",
    "summary": "The shooting of Manuel Esteban Paez Ter\u00e1n, believed to be the first environmental defender killed in the US, is the culmination of a dangerous escalation in the criminalization and repression of those who seek to protect natural resources in America, campaigners have warned.\nThe death of the 26-year-old, who was also known as 'Tortuguita' or 'Little Turtle,' in a forest on the fringes of Atlanta was the sort of deadly act 'people who have been paying attention to this issue assumed would happen soon, with no sense of joy', according to Marla Marcum, founder of the Climate Disobedience Center, which supports climate protesters.\n'The police and the state have a callousness towards the lives of those on the frontline of environmental causes and I hope this is a wake-up call to those who didn't know that,' she said. 'I hope people take the time to notice what's going on, because if this trajectory of criminalization continues, no one is going to be safe.'\nTer\u00e1n was shot and killed by police as officers from an assortment of forces swept through the small camp of a loose-knit activist group defending the urban forest on 18 January. Police say Ter\u00e1n shot and injured a Georgia state trooper with a handgun first, but the Georgia bureau of investigation has said the shooting was not recorded on body cameras, prompting calls for an independent investigation.\nState and local authorities have reacted aggressively to protesters trying to stop 85 acres of the forest being torn down to build a sprawling, state-of-the-art, $90m police training complex \u2013 dubbed 'Cop City' by opponents as it will feature a mock city for 'tactical' exercises.\nNineteen forest defenders have been charged with felonies under Georgia's domestic terrorism laws since December. Authorities have detailed the alleged acts of so-called terror by nine of those facing charges, which include trespassing, constructing a campsite and sitting in the trees of the woodland, a 300-acre wedge of land that once contained a prison farm but is now one of the largest urban forests in the US.\nBrian Kemp, the Georgia governor who declared a state of emergency and mobilized 1,000 members of the national guard over the protests, has blamed 'out-of-state rioters' and a 'network of militant activists who have committed similar acts of domestic terrorism across the country' for the troubles.\nGeorgia's response to the protests follows an alarming pattern of environmental and land rights defenders across the US being threatened, arrested and charged with increasingly drastic crimes, including terrorism, for opposing oil and gas pipelines or the destruction of forests or waterways, advocates claim.\nRelated: \u2018Assassinated in cold blood': activist killed protesting Georgia's \u2018Cop City'\n'This was meant as a chilling deterrent, to show that the state can kill and jail environmental defenders with impunity. It reflects a trend towards escalation and violence to distract from the real issue of advancing corporate interests over lands,' said Nick Estes, author of Our History Is the Future: Standing Rock Versus the Dakota Access Pipeline, and the Long Tradition of Indigenous Resistance.\nThe current crackdown on environmental and land rights defenders can be traced back to the aftermath of 9/11 and the expansion of the definition of terrorism which sparked a wave of arrests known as the 'green scare' targeting so-called eco- terrorists.\nThis then spurred the subsequent proliferation of state legislation criminalizing \u2013 or at least attempting to criminalize \u2013 all kinds of civil disobedience including Black Lives Matter protests and opposition to fossil fuel projects like gas pipelines, defined as critical infrastructure, essentially to protect business interests over environmental and Indigenous sovereignty concerns.\n'The criminalization of land and water protectors and Indigenous nations using critical infrastructure security laws can be traced back to the Patriot Act. This has contributed to the current escalation as it allows the definition of terrorism to be more vague and expansive, which is intended to have a chilling effect on peaceful protesters,' said Kai Bosworth, author of Pipeline Populism and assistant professor of geography at Virginia Commonwealth University.\nThe 2016-17 uprising against the Dakota Access oil pipeline (DAPL), which cut through the Standing Rock reservation in North and South Dakota and threatened tribal lands, burial sites and water sources, sparked a brutal response by authorities that can be seen as a before and after in how environmental defenders are policed.\nLaw enforcement used automatic rifles, sound cannons, concussion grenades and police dogs against protesters, leading to hundreds of injuries as personnel and equipment poured in from over 75 agencies across the country. Indigenous leaders and journalists were among hundreds of arrests \u2013 including 142 on a single day in October 2016 \u2013 with scores facing felony charges and hefty fines.\nSince then, a total of 20 states have enacted laws that impose harsh penalties for impeding 'critical infrastructure', such as making trespass a felony offense, or have brought in vaguely defined domestic terrorism laws that have been used to target environmentalists and Indigenous communities. Overall, 45 states have considered legislation restricting peaceful protests, and seven currently have laws pending.\nThese laws have 'been successful in really tamping down dissent and sowing fear among people', said Marcum. Much of this fear has been fueled by the labeling of protestors as 'terrorists' by senior elected figures such as Kemp, according to Elly Page, senior legal advisor at the International Center for Not-for-Profit Law, which has tracked the anti-protest bills.\n'We see autocrats around the world use rhetoric like that to clamp down on dissent,' Page said. 'The widespread demonization of protestors we've seen from politicians who call them terrorists or a mob is incredibly harmful. I think that creates an environment where violence against protestors is not unlikely and that more of these tragedies will take place.'\nRelated: This lawyer should be world-famous for his battle with Chevron \u2013 but he's in jail | Erin Brockovich\nMany of the states' legislation shares language drafted by the American Legislative Exchange Council (Alec), a rightwing group backed by fossil fuel companies.\nIn Florida, South Dakota and Oklahoma, for example, a 'riot' is considered to be any unauthorized action by three or more people, while in Florida, Oklahoma and Iowa drivers who injure protestors blocking traffic, a common tactic used by environmental activists, are given legal immunity.\nIn Arkansas, an 'act of terrorism' is considered to be anything that causes 'substantial damage' to a public 'monument', which could include graffiti. Across 17 Republican-controlled states, protesters face up to 10 years in prison and million-dollar fines for offences.\nThe broad application of these laws, as well as accompanying legislation that criminalize people and organizations that support allegedly dangerous protestors, 'chill activism and make it riskier for people to be involved in their right to protest', said Page.\n'Many of the laws have language so broad it makes constitutionally-protected speech illegal,' she said. 'It gives authorities discretion to apply the law to an activity they don't like \u2026 We know fossil fuel interests are promoting these sorts of laws.'\nAs the criminalization of peaceful protesters has spread, so has the rollout of new fossil fuel projects projects under both Democrat and Republican administrations \u2013 despite the escalation of costly and destructive extreme weather events caused by the climate breakdown.\n'There have been no effective federal efforts to help protesters or defend against criminalization,' said Charmaine Chua, assistant professor of global studies at the University of California. 'If you've been paying attention at the way cops indiscriminately kill people and the virulent antipathy towards protest movements trying to solve climate change, it's hard to be surprised at Manuel's death but still it does feel unprecedented.'\nRelated: Indigenous tribes tried to block a car battery mine. But the courts stood in the way\nSabine von Mering, one of around 900 protestors who were arrested for opposing the Line 3 pipeline that moves oil through Minnesota, said she was 'deeply shocked' to hear of Ter\u00e1n's killing but that she hoped it will galvanize more people to get involved in climate activism. 'Any criminalization of protest is an attack on our democracy,' said von Mering, an academic at Brandeis University.\n'At Line 3 there were several cases of police being extremely aggressive and violent, it was traumatizing to witness it and I'm an old white lady \u2013 I didn't experience the worst of it. The charges were used to intimidate and quell protest.'\nTo critics of the fossil fuel industry, the Line 3 protests are a prime example of its ability to shape the law enforcement that is increasingly cracking down on its opponents. In 2021 it emerged that Enbridge, the Canadian company behind the pipeline, reimbursed US police $2.4m for arresting and surveilling hundreds of Line 3 demonstrators. The payments covered officer training, police surveillance, wages, overtime, meals, hotels and equipment.\nSteven Donziger, an attorney who was embroiled in a long-running legal battle with Chevron on behalf of Indigenous people in Ecuador, said the payments are part of a 'dangerous trend' of fossil fuel influence over the functions of government and the law.\n'As we get closer to tipping point of no return on climate change, the effort to silence advocacy to have clean energy transition is intensifying,' Donziger said. 'To attack young people who are trying to preserve a forest with a military-style assault is totally inappropriate but is unfortunately a sad reflection of where the country has gone.\n'For weeks these people were called terrorists, which is a complete misuse of the word. The police have been conditioned to believe these people are terrorists and what do you do with terrorists? In the US you kill them. It becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.'",

    "excerpt": "Here's the 3 Bulldogs tabbed to go in the first round by PFF",
    "summary": "Pro Football Focus (PFF) released its latest first round 2023 NFL mock draft on Monday featuring three Georgia Bulldogs.\nFirst up is defensive lineman Jalen Carter, who is picked at No. 2 overall by the Chicago Bears after a trade down with the Houston Texans.\nJan 9, 2023; Inglewood, CA, USA; Georgia Bulldogs defensive lineman Jalen Carter (88) chases TCU Horned Frogs quarterback Max Duggan (15) during the third quarter of the CFP national championship game at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n'When Bears general manager Ryan Poles addressed his team's draft approach in his post-season press conference, he emphasized three areas: pass rusher, offense and cornerback \u2014 'premium positions.' Pass rusher doesn't just mean edge rusher, either, and a three-technique defensive tackle is paramount to Matt Eberflus' defensive scheme. In a trade-down, the Bears can recoup the early second-rounder they lost in the Chase Claypool\u00a0trade while still having their choice of any non-quarterback.\nFollowing some hints and connecting a few dots leads me to believe the Bears will have Georgia's Jalen Carter, who earned pass-rushing grades of 88.9 and 90.0 the past two seasons, at the top of their board.'\nNext up is offensive lineman Broderick Jones, who is selected by the Tennessee Titans with the 11th overall pick.\nJan 9, 2023; Inglewood, CA, USA; Georgia Bulldogs offensive lineman Broderick Jones (59) in the tunnel before warmups before the CFP national championship game against the TCU Horned Frogsat SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\n'Things have fallen off hard in Tennessee, and the best way to get back on track is through the trenches. Jones is still raw as a prospect, as this past season was just his first as a starting left tackle. But he has the size at 6-foot-4 and 310 pounds, and he moves like a real athlete along the line of scrimmage. For as physically imposing as he looks, it was his pass protection that stood out this past year. He earned an 84.2 pass-blocking grade with zero sacks and only nine pressures allowed on 449 pass-blocking snaps.'\nLastly is tight end Darnell Washington, who is projected to the Cincinnati Bengals with the 29th overall pick.\nDec 3, 2022; Atlanta, GA, USA; Georgia Bulldogs tight end Darnell Washington (0) reacts after his touchdown reception against the LSU Tigers during the second quarter at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports\n'Washington feels too unique of a talent to not be a first-rounder. No, he's likely not going to be a 1,000-yard receiver in the NFL, but at 6-foot-7 and 275 pounds, he blocks like an offensive lineman. He earned an 81.3 run-blocking grade and a 78.4 pass-blocking grade in 2022, and he's also a stellar weight-adjusted athlete who put up an 83.2 receiving grade, 475 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns this past season. His presence brings so much versatility to an offense's personnel choices.'\nThe draft will be held on April 27-29 in Kansas City and will air on NFL Network.\nStory originally appeared on UGA Wire",

    "summary": "KENNESAW, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Kennesaw State is officially accepting bandwagon fans as the latest NCAA Tournament Cinderella team.\n'I support it,' junior guard Brandon Stroud said Wednesday. 'Let's go. Jump on now!'\nFew teams have landed in March Madness with more compelling rags-to-riches credentials.\nThe Owls finished 1-28 overall and 0-16 in the ASUN Conference in coach Amir Abdur-Rahim's first season in 2019-20. Having left Division II in 2005, Kennesaw State never had a winning Division I record before this season, when they improved to 26-8 by beating Liberty 67-66 in Sunday's conference tournament championship.\nThe Owls are suddenly drawing a media crowd \u2014 including three Atlanta TV crews before their practice Wednesday \u2014 and the spotlight will grow brighter Sunday, when the public will be invited to an selection show viewing party at the KSU Convocation Center.\n'This is really cool from when we started four years ago and maybe had only one student reporter here,' Abdur-Rahim said.\nJunior Chris Youngblood was part of Abdur-Rahim's first full recruiting class following the one-win season. Youngblood said Abdur-Rahim 'most definitely' talked about the team's potential to reach March Madness as part of his recruiting pitch.\n'I probably wouldn't have come here if he didn't believe in that,' said Youngblood, who leads the Owls averaging 14.7 points per game.\nAbdur-Rahim said he began to believe the dream could be realized this season by the way his players, especially point guard Terrell Burden, responded to an ugly 88-54 loss at San Diego State on Dec. 12.\n'Normally, you get beat like that, it can shake you a little bit, make you question what you're doing,' Abdur-Rahim said.\nBurden, who had been mostly quiet early in his career, set the pace for the team at the next practice after a teammate failed to dive for a loose ball.\n'Terrell jumps him,' Abdur-Rahim said. 'I was like OK. That was the moment for me.'\nThe 5-foot-10 Burden, second on the team with 13.5 points per game, is one of four guards in the starting lineup. The Owls are likely to face a size disadvantage in their first NCAA Tournament game \u2014 no matter the matchup.\nThat only adds to the underdog outlook that Burden and his teammates are eager to embrace.\n'No matter who we play, we're going to give them a fight,' Burden said. '... I love being the underdog. I've been the underdog my whole life.'\nAbdur-Rahim is the younger brother of Shareef Abdur-Rahim, who played 13 years in the NBA and now is the NBA G League president. Shareef's son, Jabri, is a guard at Georgia, where Amir was an assistant on Tom Crean's staff before taking the Kennesaw State job.\nAt Georgia, Amir Abdur-Rahim landed star recruit Anthony Edwards, the No. 1 overall pick by Minnesota in the 2020 NBA draft.\nThe Owls' roster doesn't have top-rated NBA prospects, but Abdur-Rahim believes his team deserves to be respected as more than a 16 seed.\n'I'm hoping for a 14. If they love us enough, maybe a 13,\" Abdur-Rahim said, adding that the Owls are \"going to play a great team next week. ... It's all about draw in the tournament. I'm not here to politic for a seed.'\nHe has told his players to 'put the headphones on, and put that noise cancellation up to 10' when preparing for the NCAA Tournament.\nBut with a compelling story like theirs, Youngblood said: \"It's tough to keep the headphones on in times like this.'\n___\nAP college basketball: https://apnews.com/hub/college-basketball and https://apnews.com/hub/ap-top-25-college-basketball-poll and https://twitter.com/AP_Top25",

    "summary": "Successful \u2018Stronger Together' pilot improved outcomes for high-risk youth\n\nAtlanta, GA, March 10, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- CareSource, a mission driven Medicaid plan serving more than 500,000 Georgians, today announced the launch of CareSource Stronger Together\u2122, a program that identifies, treats and fully supports children diagnosed with significant mental health conditions to improve family preservation and reunification outcomes. Following a successful pilot, CareSource officially launched the program for families in Atlanta, with plans to increase presence in other communities throughout Georgia.\nStronger Together's data-centric approach identifies children with a significant mental health condition and develops individual care plans to meet their specific needs. The program supports children and families with an intensive, in-the-community case management focus that connects CareSource members with counseling, medication management, peer support, planned respite care and other traditional and non-traditional support services.\n'In Georgia, many of our most vulnerable children are falling through cracks in the system,' said Jason Bearden, CareSource Georgia president. 'Children diagnosed with mental or behavioral health conditions who do not have the proper resources often make multiple visits to the ER, which can potentially lead to long-term adverse health outcomes. We developed Stronger Together to not only identify these children, but to also provide a proactive solution that coordinates their care and provides full, wraparound support to keep children safe, healthy and at home with their families.'\nThe CareSource Stronger Together pilot used advanced analytics and predictive modeling, for the young Georgians who participated in the program. The pilot included 173 children with significant mental health conditions, with a majority reporting suicide ideation. Through the program, CareSource was able to lower acute patient admits by 59%, ER visits by 19%, and overall costs per member per month by 42%. Other outcomes included:\nClosed care gaps, including dental\u00a0and well\u00a0checks.\nInitiated referrals to specialty services, such as alternative or nontraditional therapies\nSupported caregivers in their efforts to safely maintain children in their home\nProvided education to clinical staff surrounding at-risk\u00a0populations\u200b\nImplemented in-the-community support by meeting families where they are\nOur partnership programs included in-community case management, art and theater therapy, behavioral health services and preventative care. Specific services provided to children and families included:\nIntensive wraparound care through Hillside\nArt/theatre therapy through Sewn-Arts\nPlanned respite through Twin Cedars\nBehavioral health services (counseling,\u00a0medication management, including peer and parent support, and care coordination)\nHousing support\nMedical and dental preventative care\nCase management specialized training\nTogether, these services and programs have significantly strengthened family preservation and reunification outcomes across the state.\nAlthough services for families increased during the pilot, cost of care decreased. The Stronger Together program will continue to support members enrolled in the pilot. CareSource will now use its predictive analytics capabilities to identify additional children and families among its membership who would likely benefit from the program. CareSource is also identifying additional unique community-based services and programs, such as Camp Twin Lakes, to be able to provide Stronger Together participants.\nCareSource believes its predictive analytics capabilities can also be used across other populations to identify those most at risk of negative outcomes and poor health and to design programs to better engage them and meet their needs.\nABOUT CARESOURCE\nCareSource is a nonprofit, nationally recognized managed care organization with over 2.3 million members. Headquartered in Dayton, Ohio since its founding in 1989, CareSource administers one of the largest Medicaid managed care plans in the U.S. The organization offers health insurance, including Medicaid, Health Insurance Marketplace and Medicare products. As a mission-driven organization, CareSource is transforming health care with innovative programs that address the social determinants of health, health equity, prevention and access to care.\nFor more, visit\u00a0www.caresource.com, follow\u00a0@caresource on Twitter, or like\u00a0CareSource on Facebook.\n###\nAttachment",

He said he would ask Congress and federal regulators to tighten banking rules to make it less likely that a major failure happens again.\nSilicon Valley Bank's failure is the second largest since the 2008 financial crisis and came after struggling tech companies\u00a0made a run on\u00a0the bank, withdrawing cash at a rapid pace and forcing the bank into a position where it had to sell bonds at a loss to cover the withdrawals.\n\nBiden seeks to increase gun background checks\u00a0in an executive order he'll sign in California Tuesday.\nA Nor'easter is bringing winter weather to\u00a0portions of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and New England.\nMoscow wants to renew\u00a0a Ukraine grain deal for a shorter term.\nNorfolk Southern's new safety measures\u00a0are ''not robust enough,'' top safety officials say.\nOn today's\u00a05 Things podcast,\u00a0USA TODAY Health Reporter Karen Weintraub looks at a possible link between face blindness and Long COVID.

    "summary": "By Howard Schneider\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - At the worst of the pandemic labor crunch, convenience store chain Sprint Mart struggled to staff its shops across the southern U.S. as available workers drifted to the higher wages Amazon.com Inc offered at its fulfillment centers or opted for flexible gig economy jobs.\nIt took two years, sequential wage hikes totaling 20%-30%, and new pick-your-own-schedule software, but Sprint Mart human resources chief Chris McKinney said the Mississippi-based firm has rounded the corner, with headcount stable at around 1,400 and enough applications in the pipeline to account for turnover.\n\"We started gaining traction six to nine months back, returning to where we felt we need to be,\" after staffing dipped as low as 1,100, he said. \"We are getting the applications, and we are in a mode right now that we aren't chasing a never-ending increase in hourly wages.\"\nIn the Federal Reserve's quest to tame inflation and find a stopping point for interest rate increases, few dynamics will be as important as what played out in Sprint Mart's drive to coax workers back to the sort of front-line service jobs hit hardest by the pandemic.\nGraphic: Wages gains slow https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/EMPLOYMENT/xmvjknjngpr/chart.png\nFed officials, chief among them Chair Jerome Powell, have singled out hiring and wage trends in the broad service sector as central to their outlook for inflation and, therefore, monetary policy. While there is disagreement about the degree to which wage increases directly influence price hikes, Powell in particular has said the recent pace of wage growth - anywhere from 4.4% to over 6% annually according to two common measures - is inconsistent with the Fed's inflation mandate.\nThat target is defined as a 2% annual increase in the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, which as of January was rising at a 5.4% annual rate.\nPowell this week will deliver his semiannual report to Congress on monetary policy and the economy, testifying before the Senate Banking Committee on Tuesday and House Financial Services Committee on Wednesday.\nIf Sprint Mart's experience is any indication, the situation may be slowly improving in the Fed's favor as companies bit-by-bit finish the wage, benefit and working-condition adjustments needed to stay competitive in the post-pandemic economy and, as McKinney put it, \"ease off the gas.\"\nBusinesses \"are looking to have more workers than fewer. That is a general proposition,\" Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic told reporters last week. Yet they also \"expect to ratchet down the pace of wage increases and eventually expect it to normalize...We are hearing a great consensus that this is still in catch-up mode and that it will attenuate.\"\nGraphic: Jobs boom, population bust https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/EMPLOYMENT/lgpdkoxnbvo/chart.png\n'TENTATIVE SIGNS'\nWhile the job market overall remains tight, with millions more workers needed than are available, Atlanta Fed Vice President and Senior Economist Jon Willis said recent data and surveys show good reasons to think wage growth will keep slowing.\nAfter pandemic-era adjustments, companies \"are very much aware that they do not want to get wages too much out of alignment with long-term plans,\" he said. Data like a recent jump in those choosing part-time work suggests firms are using flexibility on hours and other incentives short of higher wages to attract employees.\nUpcoming data will tell the tale more fully, including the latest federal survey on job openings and layoffs released Wednesday, followed Friday by an employment report for February that will include an update on wage growth.\nLike Willis, private economists and analysts at payroll firms and staffing companies also see a labor market that is stressed but adjusting.\nA recent Goldman Sachs study concluded wage growth should continue slowing even with the current low unemployment rate of 3.4%. Once pandemic-related changes are completed, companies won't have to perpetually ratchet worker incentives beyond the new baseline, Goldman Sachs economist Manuel Abecasis wrote. Between lower inflation, a slow but steady drop in job openings, and a wrapping up of pandemic adjustments, wage growth should fall by the end of next year to the 3.5% annual rate considered more consistent with the Fed's inflation goals.\nFed officials at their Jan. 31-Feb. 1 meeting appeared to generally agree there were \"tentative signs\" hiring was getting easier and growth in employment costs was slowing, meeting minutes showed.\nA blowout 517,000 new jobs added in January raised some concerns that the economy remained too hot. But even that came with slowing wage growth, and the gain was amplified by seasonal adjustments used to factor out expected swings in hiring during holidays and summer. Firms apparently retained more holiday staff than usual, which may mute future seasonal hiring and bring the labor market closer to balance.\nGraphic: Quits rate comes off the boil https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-FED/EMPLOYMENT/jnvwyalalvw/chart.png\nPICKING UP THE SLACK\nAn index of job openings from hiring firm Indeed remains above pre-pandemic levels, but has been trending down. The closely watched \"quits\" rate, considered a proxy for the overall strength of the labor market, has been falling for about a year even as it remains above pre-pandemic levels.\nThere also have been high-profile layoffs. But while rounds of firing at companies like Alphabet Inc's Google and Facebook-parent Meta Platforms have roiled the tech industry, other firms are picking up the slack.\n\"It's not a big surprise that larger companies are the ones doing layoffs. They overachieved\" during the pandemic, said Dave Gilbertson, vice president of payroll provider UKG. The company's analysis showed time clock punches at firms of more than 5,000 dropped 3% in January.\nBy contrast firms in the 50 to 250 employee range, often strong contributors to U.S. job growth, accounted for more than half of average net hiring over the three months ending in December, the largest share since the start of the pandemic, according to federal job openings and hiring data.\nNela Richardson, chief economist at payroll processor ADP, said even as economy-wide hiring remains strong, the tech layoffs may be helping mute overall wage growth.\nADP information shows the median tech sector salary is in decline, with layoffs adding to the available worker pool. A drop she has seen in overall job turnover rates likely also means less worker bargaining power than earlier in the pandemic.\n\"If that is a trend...we would expect there would be less drive for wage growth,\" she said.\n(Reporting by Howard Schneider; Editing by Dan Burns and Andrea Ricci)",

    "summary": "Elliott and Fresenius Kidney Care aim to raise kidney disease awareness through National Kidney Month in March\nWALTHAM, Mass., March 1, 2023 /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0Fresenius Kidney Care, the nation's leader in kidney care services, is once again teaming up with former National Basketball Association (NBA) All-Star Sean Elliott during National Kidney Month to raise awareness of kidney disease and emphasize the importance of early detection. Elliott, the NBA's first player to return to play after receiving an organ transplant, has thrived while battling kidney disease.\nMore than 20 years after he played in the NBA, Elliott speaks publicly about the importance of kidney health awareness, chronic kidney disease (CKD) education, and getting tested.\n\"While living with kidney disease, I was able to return to the game I love and be there for my family,\" Elliott said. \"I want to empower more people to learn about their kidney health, test for the disease early, and focus on thriving, even with the diagnosis of a kidney condition.\"\nElliott was first diagnosed with a kidney disease called focal segmental glomerular sclerosis during the 1992-93 NBA season. The two-time All-Star received a kidney transplant six years later from his brother, Noel Elliott.\nAfter a healthy recovery, Elliott stepped back on the court in March 2000 as the first NBA player to return after a transplant. Elliott continued to play for the Spurs until his retirement in 2001 capping a career as an NBA champion and two-time All-Star. Elliott's No. 32 jersey was retired by the Spurs and the University of Arizona, where Elliott won the John R. Wooden Award as the outstanding player in college basketball in 1989. Elliott is now part of the Spurs' local broadcast team.\n\"Sean's story \u2013 his diagnosis of kidney disease, his successful transplant, his return to the basketball court, and his active life since retiring from playing \u2013 shows that living a full life with kidney disease can be done,\" said Bill Valle, CEO of the Care Delivery segment of Fresenius Medical Care. \"Our teams of nurses, technicians, dietitians, social workers, and other care providers strive to help our patients manage kidney disease and, like Sean, live their lives to the fullest.\"\nFresenius Kidney Care supports nationwide efforts to raise awareness about kidney health, as 1 in 7 people \u2013 approximately 37 million American adults \u2013 are estimated to have kidney disease. Chronic kidney disease is known as a silent disease with as many as 9 in 10 adults not knowing they even have it.1\nThat's why it's crucial to detect the disease early and act. Fresenius Kidney Care aims to spread the word with employees and partners such as Elliott to educate family and friends about the importance of early detection and CKD screening.

    "excerpt": "Any indictment would come as Trump is ramping up a run to regain the White House in 2024 while simultaneously battling legal problems on multiple fronts.",
    "summary": "NEW YORK \u2014 Former President Donald Trump has been invited to testify before a New York grand jury that has been investigating hush money payments made on his behalf during his 2016 presidential campaign, according to one of his lawyers.\nTrump attorney Joseph Tacopina confirmed Thursday that the Manhattan district attorney's office has invited the former president to testify next week as prosecutors near a decision on whether to proceed with what could be the first criminal case ever brought against a former U.S. president.\n'To me, it's much ado about nothing,' Tacopina told the Associated Press, adding he didn't think prosecutors had committed 'one way or another' on a decision on whether to charge Trump. He said there was no legal basis for a case.\n'It's just another example of them weaponizing the justice system against him. And it's sort of unfair,' he said.\nThe office of Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat, declined to comment. Such an invitation to testify before a grand jury often indicates a decision on indictments is near.\nThe invitation to testify was first reported by The New York Times.\nAny indictment would come as Trump is ramping up a run to regain the White House in 2024 while simultaneously battling legal problems on multiple fronts.\nTrump, in a lengthy statement posted on his social media network, blasted the investigation as a 'political Witch-Hunt trying to take down the leading candidate, by far, in the Republican Party' and what he called a 'corrupt, depraved, and weaponized justice system.'\n'I did absolutely nothing wrong,' he said.\nMeanwhile, the district attorney in Atlanta, Ga., has said decisions are 'imminent' in a two-year investigation into possible illegal meddling in the 2020 election by Trump and his allies. A U.S. Justice Department special counsel is also investigating efforts by Trump and his allies to undo the election as well as the handling of classified documents at his Florida estate.\nThe New York grand jury has been probing Trump's involvement in a $130,000 payment made in 2016 to the porn star Stormy Daniels to keep her from going public about a sexual encounter she said she had with the Republican years earlier.\nThe money was paid out of the personal funds of Trump's now-estranged lawyer, Michael Cohen, who then said he was reimbursed by the Trump Organization and also paid extra bonuses for a total that eventually rose to $420,000.\nCohen pleaded guilty to federal charges in 2018 that the payment, and another he helped arrange to the model Karen McDougal through the parent company of the National Enquirer tabloid, amounted to an illegal campaign contribution.\nFederal prosecutors at the time decided not to bring charges against Trump, who by then was president. The Manhattan district attorneyvs office then launched its own investigation, which lingered for several years but has been gathering momentum in recent weeks.\nSeveral figures close to Trump have been spotted in recent days entering Bragg's office for meetings with prosecutors, including his former political adviser Kellyanne Conway and former spokesperson Hope Hicks.\nCohen has also met several times with prosecutors, saying after a recent visit that he thought the investigation was nearing a conclusion.\nUnder New York law, people who appear before a grand jury are given immunity from prosecution for things they say during their testimony, so potential targets of criminal investigations are generally invited to testify only if they waive that immunity. Lawyers generally advise clients not to do so if there is a potential for a criminal case.\nIt isn't clear what charges prosecutors might be exploring.\nLegal experts have said one potential crime could be the way the payments to Cohen were structured and falsely classified internally as being for a legal retainer. New York has a law against falsifying business records, but it is a misdemeanor unless the records fudging is done in conjunction with a more serious felony crime.\nTacopina said there was no crime.\n'There's no precedent for this. There's no established case law on this campaign finance stuff. It's ridiculous. And there's no underlying crime,' he said.\nSeparately, the district attorney's office has also spent years investigating whether Trump and his company inflated the value of some its assets in dealings with lenders and potential business partners. Those allegations are the subject of a civil lawsuit, filed by the state's attorney general.",

    "summary": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.\nJerome Powell calmed the horses, a bit.\nIn attempting to parse last week's blockbuster January jobs report, the Federal Reserve Chair on Tuesday reprised his take from last Wednesday's policy meeting - essentially that another couple of Fed rate hikes were probably needed to get across inflation fully, but that it was anyone's guess after that.\nAny fear of a radical Fed rethink on the back of the jobs numbers seemed wide of the mark.\nAfter doubting Fed guidance all year, financial markets have taken one look at the strength of the labour market last month and stopped fighting the central bank. They now agree that two more quarter point hikes to just above 5% are in the pipeline by July - jarring stock and bond markets for a couple of days, but not much more.\nDespite some high-octane hawkishness from his colleagues - several more of whom are speaking on Wednesday - Powell seemed to reassure investors with some basic honesty about the peculiarity of this business cycle - and the dangers of extrapolating too much from a few data points or overcommitting on future policy moves.\n\"This cycle is different from other cycles...it has just confounded all sorts of attempts to predict,\" Powell admitted.\nThere's little doubt that second-guessing recession probabilities over recent months or staying wedded too long fixed assumptions has been less than rewarding. And many think last week's jobs report should similarly be treated with care.\n\"We believe the data last week does not accurately reflect the U.S. economy. It isn't booming, although it clearly isn't on the verge of recession either,\" Columbia Threadneedle Investments economist Steven Bell wrote on Wednesday.\nThe upshot is markets are back in wait-and-see mode. Wall St futures have given back a little of Tuesday's surge. Two and 10-year Treasury yields and the dollar edged back lower.\nThe VIX gauge of U.S. stock volatility remains unusually low, below 19 and below its average of the past 30 years.\nElsewhere, investors digested President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech, in which he challenged Republicans to lift the U.S. debt ceiling and support tax policies that were friendlier to middle class Americans.\nBiden hammered corporations for profiteering from the pandemic and ran through a wish list of economic proposals, many of which are unlikely to be passed by Congress. They included a minimum tax for billionaires and a quadrupling of the tax on corporate stock buybacks.\nBut the U.S. president was especially critical of oil companies' profits on the back of Ukraine's invasion. \"I think it's outrageous,\" Biden said.\nAnd the scale of 'Big Oil's' windfall last year was in evidence around the world yet again on Wednesday.\nNorway's Equinor posted a record $74.9 billion adjusted operating profit for 2022, more than double its previous high, as gas prices soared - boosting its share price by 7%. French oil major TotalEnergies posted record net profits of $36.2 billion, also double the previous year.\nIn tech, Microsoft Corp said it was revamping its Bing search engine and Edge Web browser with artificial intelligence, signaling its ambition to retake the lead in consumer technology markets where it has fallen behind.\nAnd in global central banking, Fed hawks weren't alone. The Reserve Bank of India hiked its key repo rate by a quarter percentage point and surprised markets by leaving the door open to more tightening, saying core inflation remained high. Key developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday: * U.S. December wholesale trade sales * New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook, Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari * U.S. Treasury auctions 10-year notes * U.S. corp earnings: Disney, CVS, Fox Corp, Uber, CME, Brookfield AM, Emerson Electric, Dominion Energy, MGM resorts, Everest Re, Equifax, Yum! Brands, Eaton Corp, etc\n(By Mike Dolan, Editing by Raissa Kasolowsky mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com. Twitter: @reutersMikeD)",

    "excerpt": "President Carter added protections to more than 157 million acres of public land and created 39 total national park units",
    "summary": "This article originally appeared on Outside\nPresident Jimmy Carter--who entered hospice care at his home in Georgia this week--has been a tireless advocate for global human rights and world peace. But perhaps his most important legacy is his massive expansion of protections for our nation's public lands.\nAll told, President Carter added protections to more than 157 million acres of public land, altogether making up one-third more acreage than the state of California. He protected more than almost any president, bested only by the 230 million acres under Theodore Roosevelt.\nWhile much of that acreage is in Alaska--where two-thirds of the total state is public land--Carter also created national parks and protected public lands throughout the lower 48, including Theodore Roosevelt National Park in North Dakota, the Chattahoochee River National Recreation Area in Georgia, and the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area in California.\nA proponent of celebrating civil rights victories and leaders through the founding of urban parks, Carter established the Martin Luther King Junior National Historic Site in Atlanta, the Women's Rights National Historic Park in Seneca Falls, the Kaloko-Honokahau National Historic Park in Hawaii, and the Boston African American National Historic Site. In total, Carter created 39 national park units.\nHis work to protect large swaths of public land in Alaska first came to fruition in 1978, when Carter used the Antiquities Act to establish 13 national monuments in the state. Totaling 56 million acres, that designation more than doubled the acreage protected under National Park Service management. Two years later, Carter signed the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act (ANICLA) into law, shortly after losing his re-election bid to Ronald Reagan. ANICLA protected an additional 104 million acres of land in the state and changed the designation of some of Carter's national monuments to national parks. The law founded ten national parks and preserves, two national monuments, nine national wildlife refuges, two national conservation areas, and 25 wild and scenic rivers. It also changed the name of Mount McKinley National Park to Denali National Park, the area's Indigenous name. Altogether, 57 million acres were set aside as wilderness area, the highest level of protection available for public lands.\n\"Among the treasures to be preserved are the nation's largest pristine river valley, the place where man may first have come into the New World, a glacier as large as Rhode Island, and the largest group of peaks over 15,000 feet in North America,\" said President Carter when he signed ANICLA. \"We are setting aside for conservation an area of land larger than the State of California. By designating more than 97 million acres for new parks and refuges, we are doubling the size of our National Park and Wildlife Refuge System. By protecting 25 free-flowing Alaskan rivers in their natural state, we are almost doubling the size of our Wild and Scenic Rivers System. By classifying 56 million acres of some of the most magnificent land in our Federal estate as wilderness, we are tripling the size of our Wilderness System.'\nPresident Carter's actions were so controversial in Alaskan communities at the time that effigies of him were burned in the streets. An op-ed in The Anchorage Daily News read that \"every elected official condemned what the president had done,\" and the state's Congressperson and Senator claimed the federal government had declared war on Alaska.\nDiscussing their biographies of the president in a 2021 article in Washington Monthly, authors Jonathan Alter and Kai Bird relate an anecdote of how hard Carter himself worked on ANICLA:\n\"We never would have had the Alaska lands bill, which doubled the size of the National Park Service. Carter was down on his hands and knees with the maps on the floor of the Oval Office, and when Ted Stevens, the senator from Alaska, came in and tried to buffalo him and tell him, 'I'll vote for the bill if you exclude these areas,' Carter said, 'No, those are the headwaters of this, and there's habitat there.' In a limo on the way back to Capitol Hill, Stevens said to an aide, 'That son of a bitch knows as much about my state as I do.' If he hadn't done that, that bill would have been gutted and the developers would have gotten their way.\"\nDecades later, Carter's monument designations and ANICLA enjoy a very different image in the state. According to Trustees for Alaska, a conservation advocacy group, outdoor recreation is now responsible for $9.5 billion dollars of spending in the state, supports 92,000 jobs there, and provides $711 million in state and local tax revenue. Much of that economic activity is driven by hunting and fishing, two sectors Carter was careful to protect while creating ANICLA.\nIn 2000, The New York Times wrote about a visit Carter paid to Alaska, stating, \"[President Carter's] legacy is larger than that of anyone since the man who bought Alaska from Russia for 2 cents an acre.\" And described a welcome exactly opposite to the effigies that were burned 20 years earlier.\nCarter made that visit to protect his legacy by urging President Clinton to forever ban oil and gas development in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Carter has continued his advocacy for conservation efforts in Alaska from the time he left office. As recently as May 2022, the former president participated in various legal defenses of ANICLA and other conservation efforts. Last May, he was working to defend wildlife refuges in the state from Biden administration efforts to expand oil and gas leasing.\nIn 2016, the National Park Service recognized President Carter's contributions to protecting our nation's public lands by awarding him the title of Honorary National Park Ranger, NPS's highest civilian honor. Speaking at the ceremony, then NPS Director Jonathan B. Jarvis said, \"President Carter embodies the spirit and principals of the National Park Service and it is a great honor for me to present him with this award.\"\nWriting in his 1988 memoir, \"An Outdoor Journal: Adventures and Reflections,\" President Carter remarked on his relationship with nature, saying, \"I have never been happier, more exhilarated, at peace, rested, inspired, and aware of the grandeur of the universe and the greatness of God than when I find myself in a natural setting not much changed from the way He made it.\"\nFor exclusive access to all of our fitness, gear, adventure, and travel stories, plus discounts on trips, events, and gear, sign up for Outside+ today.",

    "summary": "If you live in the U.S. Midwest, buckle up for an intense allergy season . . . for the rest of your life.\nAllergy season is becoming more intense across the country, lasting longer and with more pollen in the air. That's bad news for the more than 60 million people in the United States who suffer from allergy-related sneezing, congestion and watery eyes. And just like brands of tissues, not all pollen-induced sneeze-fests are equal. Some places have it especially bad.\n\nA report released Wednesday by the nonprofit Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America revealed last year's U.S. \"allergy capitals.\" These were the most challenging places to live for those with pollen allergies. The rankings were based on pollen counts and took into account use of over-the-counter medication and the number of allergy physicians in the area.\nThe most difficult spot to live with allergies last year was Wichita, according to the report, followed by Dallas, Scranton, Pa., Oklahoma City and Tulsa to round out the Top 5 locations. Seven cities in the Top 20 were in Florida.\nSome of the least challenging places to live with allergies last year, according to the report, were Buffalo, Seattle, Cleveland, Austin, Akron, Ohio, and Washington, D.C. While those locations may have had relatively less pollen than other parts of the country, they also had good access to medicine and specialists, according to the report.\n\"We're seeing a lot more (pollen) in the South, which is what we are expecting because the southern cities have warmer winters. The plants grow and produce pollen for longer periods of time,\" said Sanaz Eftekhari, the foundation's vice president of research and an author of the report. Some cities in the Northeast, such as Scranton, rank high because of their lack of over-the-counter medication use and number of allergists.\nThis year's results largely fit in with regional trends seen around the past decade in the foundation's pollen data, which is collected from various pollen sensors in the Top 100 most populated U.S. metropolitan areas. In data shared with The Washington Post, the cities that have consistently ranked in the past decade as having the highest pollen rankings in the country include: McAllen, Tex.; Oklahoma City; Richmond; San Antonio; and this year's champ, Wichita.\n\"Wichita and Pennsylvania are some areas that have some extremely high levels,\" said Landon Bunderson, a pollen researcher and CEO of Pollen Sense, a company that provided pollen data for this year's Allergy Cities report. While many ground stations capture pollen grains and require someone to count them by hand (like Bunderson had to do for his Ph.D. research), these devices automatically count grains each hour.\nWhile they were not part of the report, Bunderson said, the company's ground sensors have also observed \"megaevents\" - an hour that experiences above 15,000 pollen grains per cubic meter. He said those typically occur as a microburst on the front end of a storm.\n\"They're happening when we have a big day for ripening and then we get an extreme wind event,\" Bunderson said. As pollen is released, our bodies can mistakenly identify the harmless substance as dangerous and produce chemicals to fight it, causing sneezing, wheezing, watery eyes and congestion.\n\"For someone who suffers from asthma, those [megaevents] are life-threatening,\" he said.\nThis year's allergy season is coming in early and in full force. Parts of the South and Northeast experienced record warmth in January and February. As a result, spring leaves appeared up to 20 days early in the eastern half of the country. The South experienced its earliest arrival of spring in four decades.\nHigh pollen counts followed suit, according to Pollen Sense sensors. Atlanta saw \"extremely high\" pollen counts in March, according to Atlanta Allergy & Asthma's pollen counting station. In Washington, D.C., tree pollen count reached a record high in February.\n\"Because we had a milder winter overall, we've been seeing an earlier pollen bloom,\" said Anjeni Keswani, the physician and director of George Washington University's Allergy, Asthma & Sinus Center in Washington, D.C. \"Also, because of the milder winter, our mold spores did not significantly frost or freeze over, so we're having a slightly earlier mold season as well.\"\nKeswani said she typically starts seeing pollen cases around March, but tree pollen levels increased as early as January and February. People started coming in around Valentine's Day to treat their symptoms.\nShe added that bustling cities, with a lot of traffic exhaust particles that mix in with the pollen, can spell even more bad news for people.\n\"If we breathe in sort of the air pollution of the particulate matter at the same time as the pollen, it actually can stimulate the immune system even more and create more symptoms,\" Keswani said.\nIt's not particularly simple to forecast pollen plumes, and thus allergy intensity, far out - the plumes often depend on weather and wind conditions, which can worsen and spread pollen. At the moment, Pollen Sense can forecast three days into the future.\nRight now, Keswani said, she's just trying to prevent and treat pollen allergies in people with immunization shots and medication.\n\"Pollen and pollen allergies are here to stay. With climate change, they're actually potentially going to get worse,\" she said.\nAllergy sufferers know how this goes: Spring starts calling, and pollen begins falling. Blooms keep rolling, and our noses became swollen.\nBut recently, people are experiencing a more intense allergy season - and climate change is the reason.\nClimate change affects allergy season in multiple ways. Many trees and plants require a certain amount of sustained warmth to trigger budding. Warmer winter temperatures allow them to accumulate the required amount of heat faster, causing them to start blooming earlier and for longer periods of time. The average temperature of winter, the fastest-warming season, has increased by more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit in the eastern United States since 1970.\nIncreased levels of carbon dioxide could also help supercharge photosynthesis, so trees and plants produce more pollen.\nEcologists, physicians and atmospheric scientists have already documented changes. Across North America, pollen season has lengthened by 20 days since 1990. Pollen concentrations have also increased by 21 percent over the past three decades. Data showed the largest changes in the Midwest and Texas.\nClimate models show pollen season could worsen by the end of the century with high greenhouse gas emissions. The northern United States will experience more changes than the south due to larger changes in temperature, but it also depends on the tree species in each area.\nThe northeast could experience more pollen production, as the blooming of some trees may move up. As a result, multiple tree species bloom all at once. The southeast will likely experience the highest increase in pollen production because of prolific pollen-producing oak and cypress tree species, which are dominant in the region.\n\"On a larger scale, we really do support any efforts to mitigate climate change because, in the long term, that's what's leading to this increased concentration of pollen in the air,\" Eftekhari said.",

    "excerpt": "For my first mountain bike race ever, I chose The Gobbler 6/3, hosted by Chainbuster Racing near my home in Atlanta, GA. The course was majority singletrack, twisting through the woods along the\u2026",
    "summary": "This article originally appeared on Velo News\nIn her second column for VeloNews, pro road and gravel cyclist Lauren De Crescenzo reflects on her journey to becoming a mountain biker ahead of the Life Time Grand Prix series.\nI've been putting significant work into my skills over the off-season, with a mountain bike camp in Colorado and dedicated skills work almost every day. I needed a checkpoint to measure my progress against my real deadline: The Sea Otter Classic, the first race in the Life Time Grand Prix.\nFor my first mountain bike race ever, I chose The Gobbler 6/3, hosted by Chainbuster Racing near my home in Atlanta, GA.\nRelated: Lauren De Crescenzo: 'Changing my line'\nI chose the three hour option, where we raced to complete as many laps as we could in three hours on the approximately nine mile course with 800 feet of elevation gain. The course was majority singletrack, twisting through the woods along the Georgia International Horse Park, using many of the same trails as the first Olympic mountain bike race in 1996.\nBeing majority singletrack, we knew I wouldn't be able to disguise my lack of mountain bike skills with my legs, and the race would be a good indicator of my progress.\nWhen I clicked \"confirm\" on my computer screen to register, my stomach dropped. These past couple of years of racing and winning in gravel have felt surreal in a lot of ways. I know and trust my capabilities on the bike, but some days doubt creeps in and I still feel a sense of imposter syndrome. Signing up for this race was my version of giving the middle finger to self-doubt.\nBelow are the biggest takeaways from my first mountain bike race and the latest installment of my journey of transforming from a pro roadie to a competitive mountain biker.\nThe entire drive to the race, I could feel the nerves. But when the gun went off, something inside my brain flipped a switch and the bike racer in me kicked in.\nMy coach has been assigning me sprinting drills to prepare for mountain bike starts. In the drills, I'll go from an unclipped stop to a full sprint for 15-30 seconds, a certain number of times, depending on the day. As a road cyclist, I never practiced my race starts, as my competitors typically do not attack off the start line except in the rare criterium I enter.\nSo, at the start of the Gobbler, with my right foot at the 1:00 position, I lunged forward and clipped in as fast as I could. I sprinted and made it to the singletrack first, getting the \"hole shot.\" The singletrack was narrow and tree-lined, with twisty downhills, all features that once scared the sh*t out of me!\nThen, I went into my mental notebook, focusing on the skills we've been working on.\nIn my previous life, we used to joke that I was allergic to corners. But you can't be a good mountain biker without being good at cornering. Now I'm embracing corners and starting to use them to my advantage. I've previously struggled with backing down going into a corner. At the race, however, I got in there first, held my own line, and then accelerated out of the next corner to get a gap and build speed.\nCornering on a road bike typically follows the same formula: go wide, hit the apex, and accelerate out. In mountain biking, the formula constantly changes.\nYou can never lose focus because you can never see more than 10-20 seconds up the trail. You always need to be planning the best line, well in advance. Unlike road, every corner is different with different obstacles from rocks to roots to mud. Mountain biking, I'm learning to be constantly adaptable and use the knobby tires to my advantage.\nOn the first lap, I picked the wrong line, ascending a rocky uphill. I fell forward on the bike, and hit my knee on a rock. In the past, I've had a massive complex with falling, but this time, I picked myself up and didn't lose more than two seconds.\nI like the simplicity of tactics in a mountain bike race. The general plan is to get to the front, get into the zone, and start your technical time trial.\nIn road and gravel, there is drafting, teams are working together, and the strongest rider doesn't always win. I've fallen victim to breakaway mates sitting on my wheel for miles and then outsprinting me at the line. You can't get away with that on the mountain bike. Drafting is minimal and you must match the technical skills of the racer in front of you.\nIn road/gravel races, it's generally more advantageous to be steady on the bike. In mountain biking, you're constantly changing your effort and taking every opportunity to pedal.\nTowards the end of the lap, there was a long straightaway section where I averaged 20 mph and had the fastest time for both men and women for the day (according to Strava) In this section, I was able to solidify my lead, get into the zone, go into time trial mode and was able to complete four laps in 2:59:58!\nIan Boswell (who also raced the Gobbler) and I talked a lot about how much intense mental focus mountain biking requires. He came to Georgia for the race after I mentioned it when we were hosting a virtual SBT GRVL training ride on Wahoo RGT. Ian said he would be at the Wahoo HQ in late January in Atlanta, so he signed up for the six hour solo option as preparation for the upcoming Cape Epic.\nThe two of us have a lot in common beyond our respective wins at Unbound 2021. We both suffered traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) in our professional road careers that eventually led us to switch to gravel. Ian is also taking on mountain biking as a new discipline.\nAfter the race, we agreed that the mental focus required at these mountain bike races is very challenging, and even more so given our TBIs.\nMy ride at the Gobbler was especially meaningful to me. It represents the hard work my team and I have put in over the last several months, as well as my overcoming fear and anxiety and learning something new at a later stage in my career. Just the idea of mountain biking is something that used to make me nervous, but it's now becoming exciting.\nI am not under any illusions that a win in a local mountain bike race is an indication of a result at a big race like Sea Otter, but my performance at the Gobbler 6/3 is a positive reference point in my progression. Most importantly, we know the techniques and processes are working.\nThe mindset of improving 0.1 percent a day is working, and we'll continue down this road as far as it takes us. I hope my story inspires others to try something new and scary, embrace the fear, put in the work, and do something they never thought possible!\nFor exclusive access to all of our fitness, gear, adventure, and travel stories, plus discounts on trips, events, and gear, sign up for Outside+ today.",

    "summary": "EXCLUSIVE: Former Republican Senate candidate Herschel Walker's campaign shelled out hundreds of thousands of dollars last year to a defunct car wash owned by a donor.\nBetween March 18 and Dec. 5, amid a heated race to unseat incumbent Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., Walker's campaign arm Team Herschel wired 11 payments worth $595,606 to Jetts, according to Federal Election Commission records. Other Walker-linked committees added nearly $270,000 in payments to the company during the midterm elections. Walker's unsuccessful campaign spent more on private jet travel than any other campaign during the 2022 elections, a Fox News Digital review found.\nJetts, which received the Walker campaign cash, is Jetts Car Wash, LLC, a former Kennesaw, Georgia, business initially formed in 2015, state filings reviewed by Fox News Digital show. The business' address was switched a year later to a residential address in Powder Springs, Georgia, and registered to an individual named Thomas Huff. Property records show the new address belongs to Huff, who, along with three relatives, gave maximum donations to Walker's campaign.\nThe car wash was ultimately dissolved in October after it failed to file the required registration information with state officials. However, Walker's campaign continued paying the business hundreds of thousands of dollars for \"air charter\" through December.\n\nHuff told Fox News Digital that Walker's campaign had a \"lease\" but didn't elaborate on the details of such an arrangement and didn't comment on the payments to his dissolved car wash.\n\n\"I don't have any comment. You're just trying to stir something up and hurt someone that's a really good person,\" Huff said in a phone call before abruptly hanging up.\n\nHuff had maxed out his donations to Walker's campaign months before the private jet payments to his car wash company began. On Oct. 18, 2021, he sent the maximum $2,900 contribution for the general election and $1,900 for the primary election, adding to the $1,000 he had given in September for the primary and bringing his total to $5,800. He also gave Walker's campaign $1,000 for \"runoff\" cash on Oct. 18.\nAnd on the same day that Huff moved a bulk of his donations to Walker's campaign, Oct. 18, 2021, Huff's father, mother, and wife each sent maximum contributions of $2,900 for both the general and primary elections, totaling $17,400 between the relatives.\nMallory Blount, a spokesperson for Walker's campaign, referred Fox News Digital to campaign treasurer Salvatore Purpura. And in a brief phone interview, Purpura confirmed he was familiar with Jetts Car Wash and \"definitely\" knew Huff but declined to comment further. Earlier this month, the FEC warned Purpura in a letter that it had identified irregularities related to the Walker campaign's finances.\nA series of other business entities \u2014 some active and many dissolved like Jetts Car Wash \u2014 have been registered to Huff's residential address in Powder Springs. Among those entities is a charter company named Aviation Development Group. Within the Walker donations, Huff lists his occupation as president of Aviation Development Group, while each of his relatives reports their occupation as 'business owner' of the company. All but one of the donations from Huff and his relatives (Huff's initial $1,000 primary donation from September 2021) contains a memo stating: \"Attribution of contribution from eligible funds at Aviation Development Group, LLC.\"\n\nAviation Development Group operates a single Gulfstream IV aircraft, according to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) documents. The Gulfstream jet was formerly registered under a firm named JEGE, LLC, which had been owned by convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein before Huff purchased the firm and jet from Epstein in 2019.\nHuff then sued Epstein's estate in 2021, demanding that the purchase be canceled because the jet and company had been \"tainted\" by Epstein's crimes, but the case was tossed by a federal judge in March. The Gulfstream wasn't the infamous \"Lolita Express,\" a discontinued Boeing 727 that Epstein allegedly used to transport underage girls and high-profile celebrities to his properties.\nFAA documents also show that the jet, which Fox News Digital confirmed was the same plane Huff purchased from Epstein and sued over, is technically operated by an Aviation Development Group based in Montana and registered by All Day $49 Montana Registered Agent, a company that specializes in registering companies for individuals \"ensuring your personal information stays off public record.\"\nFlight tracking data compiled by ADS-B Exchange shows the plane made frequent trips in and around Georgia throughout 2022.\nThe plane's trips also seemingly line up with some of the payments made by Team Herschel. For example, the campaign paid Jetts $118,795 for \"Air Charter 9-7\" in September. On Sept. 7, the Gulfstream flew from Panama City, Florida, to Atlanta. The typical hourly rate for a mid-size jet is $3,000-4,000, according to U.S. charter firm Prive Jets.\n\nTeam Herschel's final payment to Jetts was $195,890 on Dec. 5 and earmarked for \"Air Charter 11-9 Thru 12-8,\" filings show. Between Nov. 9 and Dec. 8, the plane made multiple trips from Atlanta including one to the Bahamas just days before Walker's runoff election. While the plane was abroad, Walker was campaigning in Georgia, according to media reports.\nOther Walker-linked committees also paid hundreds of thousands for private jet travel to Huff's car wash company. Team Herschel's People's Champion Committee, a joint fundraiser between his campaign and leadership PAC, the People's Champion PAC, disbursed $243,316 to Jetts between April 12, 2022, and September 9, 2022, filings show.\nAnother committee named 34N22, Inc. \u2014 which records show is not affiliated with any other committee but appears to be a play on his former football number, 34, and the election year, 2022 (34 in 22) \u2014 spent $25,474.87 on air travel with Jetts on Sept. 15. 34N22's filings show that it poured $6.8 million into independent expenditures during the midterm elections, including TV and digital advertisements, direct mail, and text messages, all of which benefited Walker.\nThe only other aircraft directly associated with Huff is a Dassault Falcon 10 registered under the firm DWTS, LLC which is based at his residential address. Flight records indicate the plane didn't make a single trip last year, though it is possible to request permission from federal authorities to block tracking data from public view.\nThere is also a Cessna Citation III jet registered under the company Avex Holdings Heli, Inc. in Delaware that appears to be linked to Huff. The plane makes frequent trips in and around Georgia. However, Fox News Digital couldn't confirm the plane belongs to Huff.\nOn Dec. 6, Walker was handily defeated in the runoff by Warnock, making him the sole Republican to lose a statewide election in Georgia last year. The defeat also handed Democrats a 51-49 majority in the Senate.\n\nOverall, Walker's campaign spent by far the most money on private jet travel compared to every other campaign during the 2022 midterm election, according to election filings. The next highest spender was former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's, D-Calif., campaign which paid nearly $350,000 chartering flights.\nWarnock, by comparison, paid $70,339 for private jet travel during the campaign.",

    "summary": "PLAINS, Georgia (AP) \u2014 When Jimmy Carter stepped onto the national stage, he brought along those closest to him, introducing Americans to a colorful Georgia family that helped shape the 39th president's public life and now, generations later, is rallying around him for the private final chapter of his 98 years.\n'Family has always been important to Uncle Jimmy,' said Kim Fuller, whose father, Billy Carter, was the former president's youngest brother and a favorite subject of national political reporters drawn to this family of Washington outsiders.\nCarter has long outlived his nuclear family, including his mother, Lillian, and Billy, both of whom featured prominently in his political life \u2013 bringing charm, occasional scandal and even a forgotten brand of cheap brew: 'Billy Beer.' The former president's most constant political partner, wife Rosalynn, remains by his side as he receives end-of-life care at their home in Plains, Georgia, the tiny town where both were born.\nMarried since 1946 \u2013 longer than any other first couple \u2013 the Carters have four children and more than 20 grandchildren and great-grandchildren. Along with nieces, nephews and inlaws, it's a sprawling extended family that has given Jimmy Carter a near-constant stream of visitors since he announced Feb. 18 that he would forgo further medical interventions and shift to hospice care at home.\n'This is what I've known my entire life, what most of us have known,' said Fuller, who was school-aged when Carter was elected governor in 1970, then president in 1976. 'I remember taking the train up to Atlanta to see them at the Governor's Mansion.'\nThe Carters are not an establishment dynasty like the Republican Bushes or the Democratic Kennedys \u2013 whose scion Ted Kennedy was a Carter rival. But the family is critical to understanding the former president, from his methodical style to his outspoken Baptist faith.\nWhen he launched his national campaign in 1974, it consisted mostly of the 'Georgia mafia' \u2013 the name Washington would give his home-state advisers who came to the capital as outsiders \u2013 and his relatives. The peanut farmer-turned-politician added other Georgia supporters who traveled across the country campaigning.\nTogether they were 'the Peanut Brigade,' and they set a new standard in presidential politics for retail campaigning in early primary states.\n'Family members would disperse to different states and then they would all come back on Friday, go back through the questions they had gotten,' Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar explained to the Associated Press in 2020, after she visited Carter as she sought the Democratic nomination.\nAs the candidate, Carter 'would talk about how he would answer' voters so his stand-ins would be prepared for their next trips, Klobuchar said.\nThe Carters' older sons were part of the crew. Their daughter, Amy, was seven when the campaign began; she remained mostly shielded other than being visible at public events with her parents. It was Carter's mother and 'baby brother,' 13 years his junior, who garnered headlines.\nLillian was a widow \u2013 Carter's father, 'Mr. Earl,' died in 1953 \u2013 who had turned over management of the family farm and peanut warehouse to Jimmy and Rosalynn. In her late 60s, Lillian applied for the Peace Corps and spent several years in India as her son made his climb to the Governor's Mansion. After her return, Carter told her he planned to run for president.\n'President of what?' she replied.\n'She ran the family,' Fuller said. 'Daddy and Uncle Jimmy may have acted like they did, but we all knew.'\nThat didn't necessarily extend to Carter's campaigns, of course. Whether candidate or executive, Carter was a famed micro-manager. Fuller mused, though, that he got it from his parents, exacting figures who had demanded much of Carter on the family farm.\nUnlike Earl Carter, Lillian was a relative progressive even when Carter was a child. She 'was impervious to criticism because of her independent spirit,' Carter wrote around his 90th birthday.\nTabbed 'the most liberal woman in Georgia' by some journalists, she preferred topics other than politics. She declared White House life 'boring' and flouted images of Baptist teetotaling.\n'I know folks have a tizzy about it, but I like a little bourbon,' she said. 'I'm a Christian, but that doesn't mean I'm a long-faced square.'\"\nBilly Carter never seemed to find a comfortable place in his brother's political operation.\n'Daddy was perfectly happy at the gas station,' Kim Fuller said, gesturing across the street from her 'Friends of Jimmy Carter' office festooned with 1976 posters and memorabilia.\nInitially, that meant flaunting his 'redneck power pick-up' to out-of-town reporters.\nAmber Roessner, a University of Tennessee professor and expert on Carter's campaigns, said some national media looked down on the Carters as rural Americans unworthy of the White House. Some reporters indulged their snobbery by covering Billy Carter while avoiding direct attacks on his brother, a Naval Academy graduate and engineer by training.\nThe younger Carter capitalized on his image with a deal for 'Billy Beer.' News sources at the time reported that he got a $50,000 annual licensing fee from one brewer. That would be about $240,000 today, measured by consumer price index inflation. The president's annual salary at the time was $200,000.\nA beer deal, though, was mostly an eccentricity, like Lillian Carter's quips.\nMore serious was the presidential sibling getting a $220,000 loan from the Libyan government, prompting one of several IRS and government inquiries of Carter's activities as an apparent intermediary between American and Libyan oil interests. A Senate committee found that Billy Carter never influenced any American policy, effectively absolving the president of any wrongdoing. But the drama was another damaging blow ahead of Carter's 1980 defeat.\nAfter their return to Georgia, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter built The Carter Center in Atlanta, staffed not by 'the Peanut Brigade' but policy experts who advanced their international diplomatic and public health missions. In Plains, they became the marquee members of Maranatha Baptist Church, teaching Sunday School to overflow crowds until recent health problems and the COVID-19 pandemic.\nLillian Carter died in 1983, less than three years after her son left the presidency. Billy Carter died in 1988.\nWhile they've avoided dynastic trends, Jimmy Carter has passed down some of the family business. Eldest son Jack ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate in Nevada in 2006. Grandson Jason served in the Georgia state Senate, as his grandfather did, and lost the 2014 governor's race.\nJason Carter now chairs The Carter Center board \u2013 but only after his grandparents finally retired well into their 90s.\n'He wanted to be able to see and experience the transition for The Carter Center to go on without him,' the younger Carter said in September, adding that he 'would be shocked if I ever ran for office again.'\nBilly's daughter, meanwhile, inherited the church rostrum. She taught again Sunday, at one point emphasizing her uncle's individual faith journey.\n'Every breath he takes, he's supposed to. Every step he takes, he's supposed to,' she said. 'And one day . . . he's going to meet Christ, and he knows it. He knows it. And our hearts are heavy. But his isn't. His heart's not heavy.'",

    "summary": "PLAINS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Jimmy Carter's path to the presidency is an oft-told story, especially by aspiring presidents trying to be the next politician to defy Washington expectations.\nAs a little-known Georgia governor, Carter announced in late 1974 that he'd seek the presidency. Atlanta's largest newspaper answered with a mocking headline: 'Jimmy Who?' National media mostly yawned.\nUndeterred, the peanut farmer took his family and friends to Iowa and New Hampshire, where 'the Peanut Brigade' set the modern standard for a retail campaign and helped elect Carter as the 39th president.\nBut the long odds weren't just about 1976 for Carter, who is 98 and now receiving end-of-life care at his home in Plains, Georgia. Carter's early life and career were replete with dominoes that could have blocked his White House road before he knew he was on it.\nHere are some 'What Ifs?' that, had they played out differently, may have made it impossible for Americans ever to answer that mocking question from Atlanta newspaper editors.\nTHE ARCHERY FARM\nCarter and his wife, Rosalynn, now 95, were born in Plains. But Carter's parents, Lillian and Earl Carter, moved their family in 1927 to a farm in the mostly Black community of Archery, just outside Plains. Thus began Carter's exposure to divisions of race and class in the segregated, Depression-era South.\nYoung Jimmy had Black playmates with whom he hunted, fished and fashioned homemade toys. Like their neighbors, the Carters had 'no running water, electricity or insulation' and depended on open fireplaces for heat. 'We relieved ourselves in slop jars during the night,' Carter wrote in a memoir.\nYet despite the lack of luxury, the future president was still secure in relative privilege, because he was the child of the white, land-owning family at the center of a community where many impoverished Black residents worked for his parents.\nOne of his earliest influencers was 'Miss Rachel' Clark, a Black neighbor and caregiver who was married to the unofficial foreman of the Carter farm. Carter, who spent considerable time at the Clarks' home, would later say he 'knew Rachel Clark in many ways better than my mother.'\nThose experiences \u2014 seeing the humanity of his Black friends but still living under the white supremacist order of the era \u2014 undergirded his public life as a Southern Democrat. He learned early how to navigate an evolving country and party that was stacked with segregationists in Carter's formative political years before coming to embrace civil rights. Carter did not fight for civil rights legislation in the 1950s and 1960s. He campaigned carefully for Georgia governor in 1970, avoiding explicit mentions of race. He won with a small-town, rural coalition of Black voters and white conservatives \u2013 then used it to govern more progressively on race than he had campaigned. It was a political tightrope he may never have managed if he'd grown up in the heart of Plains rather than Archery.\n\u2018MR. EARL'\nJimmy and Rosalynn Carter married in 1946 and left Plains to launch his promising career with the U.S. Navy \u2013 with no notions of returning except as visitors. But Carter's father, who had become a prominent merchant and state lawmaker, died in 1953. Carter made the decision, without consulting Rosalynn, to move the young family back home, where the pair built the family farm operations into an impressive peanut agribusiness. Carter joined the local school board and within a decade would run for the Georgia Assembly, further replicating his father's path. If 'Mr. Earl' had lived longer, his namesake might have become an admiral in some far-flung naval post, but never commander in chief.\nELECTION FRAUD\nCarter sought elected office for the first time in 1962, 'somewhat quixotically,' he recalled. His Democratic opponent in the state Senate primary was a peanut buyer named Homer Moore. But, the real barrier was Joe Hurst, a neighboring county's political boss. On Election Day, Carter and his allies caught Hurst pressuring voters and discarding ballots cast for Carter. Quitman County results showed Moore with more votes than registration rolls recorded altogether. Carter challenged the results with the party. After court tussles, Carter ended up on the general election ballot and prevailed. It took a subsequent Senate floor dispute before he was finally sworn in.\nTHE 1966 CHOICE\nCarter wasn't much for the legislature's back-slapping ways. By 1966, he decided to run for Congress against a heavyweight incumbent, Bo Callaway. Then Ernest Vandiver, a former Georgia governor, dropped out of the governor's race, allowing Callaway to step into his place against arch-segregationist Lester Maddox. With Callaway's switch, Carter was on his way to Washington. But the young state senator was bothered by Georgians having to choose between Callaway and Maddox. (In this era, the Democratic nominee was virtually assured a November victory.) Carter tried to recruit a moderate Democrat to run against them but was unsuccessful. So, he recalled, 'I decided to relinquish my assured seat in the U.S. Congress and run for governor.'\nHe lost to Maddox. But the decision was the start of a four-year campaign that resulted in his 1970 gubernatorial win.\nNO GRAND PLANS\nHistory often reveals happenstance in the lives of every president. Carter even chose 'Turning Point' as the title of his book about the 1962 state Senate election that changed his career trajectory. Lyndon Baines Johnson won a disputed early congressional race. Bill Clinton lost his first reelection bid as a young Arkansas governor and required a rehabilitation follow-up victory before he reached the national stage a decade later in 1992. George W. Bush narrowly won the Texas governor's race in 1994, the same night his brother Jeb lost the Florida governor's race as a favorite. The Texan would be president six years later. Floridian Jeb, once thought of as the political darling in that generation of the Bush dynasty, likely will never be.\nYet the Bushes were a blue-blooded political family already anchored in the national establishment. Johnson and Clinton had no political birthrights but set out from young ages to reach the nation's highest office. As a young congressman, Johnson even dubbed himself 'LBJ,' patterned after Franklin Delano Roosevelt's moniker, 'FDR.'\nFor Carter, ambition was a driving force generally. But it was not singularly focused.\nCarter would serve just one term. His struggles to corral inflation, ease energy shortages and quickly free American hostages in Iran overshadowed achievements at home and abroad. He signed notable legislation on the environment, education and mental health care, and started deregulation of key industries, including airlines. Abroad, he struck a peace deal between Egypt and Israel, normalized relations with China and negotiated treaties turning over control of the Panama Canal.\nCarter would say later that he never focused on winning a second term \u2014 to his political peril \u2014 just as he had no grand design to win his first.\nThose four years in the White House 'were the pinnacle of my political life,' he recalled around his 90th birthday, but 'there was never an orderly or planned path to get there during my early life.'",

    "summary": "Cloud automation, self-service, and service orchestration are trending, according to year-over-year benchmarks from IT Ops, DevOps, CloudOps, and DataOps teams.\n\nALPHARETTA, Ga., March 16, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Stonebranch, a leading provider of service orchestration and automation solutions, today published the Stonebranch 2023 Global State of IT Automation Report: IT Automation and Orchestration Benchmarks for IT Ops, DevOps, CloudOps, and DataOps Teams, its annual benchmark study on the automation priorities, expectations, and challenges of IT professionals worldwide.\n\"We're proud to release the Stonebranch 2023 Global State of IT Automation Report,\" said Giuseppe Damiani, CEO at Stonebranch. \"Our research provides essential insights for IT Ops, DevOps, CloudOps, and DataOps professionals worldwide who use automation to help connect workflows and drive efficiencies. We're committed to contributing to the growth and innovation of the IT industry and helping our clients achieve their automation goals.\"\nKey Findings\nThe Stonebranch 2023 Global State of IT Automation report is based on a January 2023 survey of IT automation professionals and executives. Its insights include:\nCloud is a top priority in 2023. Cloud automation tops the list of planned automation tool investments this year. Infrastructure automation, also focused on the cloud, comes in second place.\nCloud automation gains permanence. Compared to 2022, more enterprises are running permanent product jobs than ad-hoc development or test jobs. When asked which types of jobs respondents will run in the cloud in 2023, permanent production jobs moved to first place. Meanwhile, year-over-year, ad-hoc jobs fell from first place to third place.\nSelf-service automation is booming. 92% empower end-users from data, cloud, development, and line-of-business teams to execute their own workflows and processes. The most dramatic year-over-year growth is from data teams experiencing 2x growth and developers seeing a 4x increase.\nCentralized automation teams drive best-practice adoption throughout the enterprise. 77% have a centralized IT automation team that cascades preferred tools and best practices throughout the organization.\nData pipeline automation remains fractured. Data teams use a relatively equivalent mix of job schedulers, scripts, enterprise workload automation, and open-source schedulers to automate their data pipelines. No data team uses only one tool. Rather, most data teams employ all the different automation methods \u2014 indicating an opportunity to implement an orchestration layer for centralized management and observability.\nMulti-cloud data transfers are on the rise. 82% of those surveyed automate data transfers between cloud service providers.\nAutomation has evolved into orchestration. 81% plan to grow their automation program, and 86% plan to replace or add a new platform to support orchestration.\nSOAPs have grown in popularity. Nearly a third of respondents said they plan to invest in service orchestration and automation platforms (SOAPs) to centrally orchestrate cloud alongside on-premises tools within a hybrid IT environment.\n'Our research shows that organizations are evolving their use of IT automation and orchestration technologies, particularly in response to the unique challenges posed by cloud environments,' said Peter Baljet, CTO at Stonebranch. 'Today's hybrid IT landscapes are becoming more complex, and automation is increasingly seen as essential to optimize performance, ensure security, and control costs.'\nTo fully explore the research results:\nDownload the full report \u2014 Stonebranch 2023 Global State of IT Automation: IT Automation and Orchestration Benchmarks for IT Ops, DevOps, CloudOps, and DataOps Teams.\nWatch the research results webinar, which highlights key trends and insights from the report, as well as Stonebranch's recommendations for success.\n\nReport Methodology\nThe findings in the Stonebranch 2023 Global State of IT Automation report are based on a comprehensive online survey carried out globally in January 2023, and participants were selected through a stringent, multi-step screening process to ensure that only relevant respondents were included. The survey participants held positions in IT Operations, Data Operations, Cloud Operations, Platform Operations, IT Service Management, and Application Development, and worked for organizations with over 1,000 employees.\nAbout Stonebranch\nStonebranch builds IT orchestration and automation solutions that transform business IT environments from simple IT task automation into sophisticated, real-time business service automation.

    "excerpt": "OLDWICK, N.J., March 10, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of \"a\" (Excellent) of\u2026",
    "summary": "OLDWICK, N.J., March 10, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--AM Best has affirmed the Financial Strength Rating (FSR) of A (Excellent) and the Long-Term Issuer Credit Ratings (Long-Term ICR) of \"a\" (Excellent) of American Southern Insurance Company (Topeka, KS) and its wholly owned and 100% reinsured subsidiary, American Safety Insurance Company (collectively referred to as American Southern Group). Additionally, AM Best has affirmed the FSR of A- (Excellent) and the Long-Term ICRs of \"a-\" (Excellent) of Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Company and its wholly owned and 100% reinsured subsidiary, Bankers Fidelity Assurance Company (collectively referred to as Bankers Fidelity Life Insurance Group [BFLIG]). Concurrently, AM Best has affirmed the Long-Term ICR of \"bbb-\" (Good) of the parent company, Atlantic American Corporation (Atlantic American) [NASDAQ: AAME]. The outlook of these Credit Ratings (ratings) is stable. All companies are domiciled Atlanta, GA, unless otherwise specified.\nThe ratings of American Southern Group reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its adequate operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate enterprise risk management (ERM).\nThe ratings also reflect American Southern Group's strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by Best's Capital Adequacy Ratio (BCAR), historically profitable operating results, management's disciplined underwriting approach and local market expertise. These positive rating factors are partially offset by the group's substantial annual stockholder dividend payments to the parent, which Atlantic American uses to service its debt.\nThe ratings also consider the financial leverage and interest coverage at Atlantic American, with an adjusted debt-to-capital ratio of 20.8% at Sept. 30, 2022. The interest coverage ratios benefit from the trend of underwriting and operating earnings in the insurance operating companies.\nThe ratings of BFLIG reflect its balance sheet strength, which AM Best assesses as very strong, as well as its marginal operating performance, neutral business profile and appropriate ERM.\nBFLIG has the strongest level of risk-adjusted capitalization, as measured by BCAR, which supports its insurance and investment risks. This group's capital and surplus has benefited from explicit capital support provided by its parent company, Atlantic American, which has helped to maintain capital strength and offset strain of new business growth. AM Best expects Atlantic American to continue to provide capital support to BFLIG as needed. BFLIG generated favorable earnings in 2022 after a modest net loss in 2021. Results have improved in recent years after the organization implemented various measures to improve underwriting experience in its Medicare supplement business, including rate increases, enhanced data and analytics, and underwriting practice changes. BFLIG's neutral business profile assessment reflects the continued diversification of its business mix through expansion of its supplemental accident and health and life products.\nThis press release relates to Credit Ratings that have been published on AM Best's website.

    "excerpt": "Trump's attorneys want Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis's office to be recused from any further investigation or prosecution of the matter involving Trump.",
    "summary": "Washington \u2014 Lawyers for former President Donald Trump on Monday asked a Georgia court to suppress the report of a special purpose grand jury that investigated alleged efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election.\nIn a nearly 500-page filing submitted to a state court in Fulton County, Ga., Trump's attorneys criticized the process of the special purpose grand jury, calling it \"confusing, flawed, and at-times, blatantly unconstitutional.\"\nIn addition to asking the court to quash the grand jury's December report, expunge it from the record, and prevent any prosecuting body from using evidence derived from the grand jury, Trump's lawyers also want Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis' office to be recused from any further investigation or prosecution of the matter involving Trump.\n\"Given the scrutiny and the gravity of the investigation and those individuals involved \u2013 namely, the movant President Donald J. Trump, this process should have been handled correctly, fairly, and with deference to the law and the highest ethical standards,\" lawyers Jennifer Little and Drew Findling wrote.\nTrump's attorneys claimed the special purpose grand jury involved a \"constant lack of clarity as to the law, inconsistent applications of basic constitutional protections for individuals brought before it, and a prosecutor's office that was found to have an actual conflict yet continued to pursue the investigation.\"\nThe grand jury was empaneled in early May 2022 following a request by Willis and served as an investigatory body that could recommend charges, but not issue indictments. Consisting of 26 Fulton County residents, three of whom were alternates, the grand jury was created to investigate circumstances related to possible attempts to disrupt the administration of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia.\nOver the course of its roughly six-month probe, the grand jury heard testimony from 75 witnesses, including top Georgia officials and several people close to Trump.\nPortions of the grand jury's report were released last month after a judge ordered Willis's office to make public three sections \u2014 the introduction, conclusion and a section stating that a majority of the grand jury \"believes that perjury may have been committed by one or more witnesses testifying before it.\"\nThe report, submitted in December, further stated that the grand jury found \"by a unanimous vote that no widespread fraud took place in the Georgia 2020 presidential election that could result in overturning that election.\"\nThe remaining sealed sections could include recommendations for indictments, but they will not be released until after Willis' office decides whether to pursue charges. Willis has not yet decided how to proceed, but has said a decision is \"imminent.\" The special purpose grand jury was dissolved in January.\nIn their filing in the Fulton County superior court, Trump's lawyers argued the statutes governing the special purpose grand jury are \"unconstitutionally vague,\" and the judge supervising the panel applied the statutes \"in a way that violated the due process rights\" of the people involved when he held the special purpose grand jury was a criminal grand jury.\nLittle and Findling also criticized comments made by the grand jury's forewoman, Emily Kohrs, in interviews to numerous media outlets, which they claim \"violate notions of fundamental fairness and due process and taint any future grand jury pool.\" Five other jurors spoke with the Atlanta Journal-Constitution about their time on the special purpose grand jury.\n\"Accordingly, President Donald J. Trump hereby moves to quash the SPGJ's report and preclude the use of any evidence derived therefrom, as it was conducted under an unconstitutional statute, through an illegal and unconstitutional process, and by a disqualified district attorney's office who violated prosecutorial standards and acted with disregard for the gravity of the circumstances and the constitutional right of those involved,\" Trump's lawyers wrote.\nWillis could not question a Republican lawmaker, state Sen. Burt Jones, after the judge found she had a conflict of interest because she hosted a fundraiser for Jones' Democratic opponent in the race for Georgia lieutenant governor.\nLittle and Findling requested a hearing to press their arguments. Willis' office declined to comment on the filing.\nThe investigation by the Fulton County district attorney is one of several Trump is facing, and his filing comes days after the former president claimed he expects to be arrested Tuesday as part of a probe by the Manhattan district attorney involving payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels before the 2016 presidential election and the alleged falsification of related business records to hide campaign finance violations.\nA special counsel at the Justice Department is also examining Trump's handling of government records discovered at his South Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago and efforts to stop the transfer of presidential power after the 2020 presidential election.",

    "summary": "There are lots of crosscurrents in our economy. It complicates coming up with candidates for the captioned article to choose which ones stand out for this article.\u00a0That said, the following are my choices for the month of February.\nThe Good.\u00a0Retail sales grew a robust 3% in the month of January as the American consumer kicked off the new year with a bang. The increase offset two consecutive down months in the final two months of last year which is unusual since the holidays typically boost year end spending.\u00a0 The 3% growth was the largest in almost two years, since March of 2021.\u00a0 In fact, the Atlanta Fed, which does GDP growth forecasts, increased its first-quarter GDP growth from 2.2% to 2.4%.\u00a0 Interestingly, the consumer spent more modestly on consumer staples such as food and gasoline and spent more lavishly on big-ticket discretionary items.\u00a0 Retail sales grew in almost every category including restaurants, car dealerships, department stores, furniture sellers, and appliance outlets.\u00a0 Conversely, grocery store sales were up slightly while gasoline sales were flat.\u00a0 Some of the possible reasons for the increase were people using gift cards received during the holidays (gift card sales are booked when they are spent, not when they are purchased), high-income earners could have spent on luxury items from their ample savings and the new year brought those on Social Security a raise of 8.7%, the largest adjustment in decades.\nThe Bad. Inflation continues to outpace wage gains reducing everyone's standard of living.\u00a0 In the U. S. nominal wage growth which means adjusted for inflation, has slowed sharply since the middle of last year. Average hourly earnings for private-sector non-farm workers rose 4.4% for the 12-month period through January this year.\u00a0 The rate of growth for the same timeframe last year was 5.6%.\u00a0 Further, the rate of inflation for the 12 months through January of this year was 6.6% accounting for a 2% decline in real wages.\u00a0 Why do wages never seem to catch up with inflation?\u00a0 One of the reasons is that wages move more slowly and sluggishly on typically an annual basis.\u00a0 Prices can jump quickly with gasoline being a good example.\u00a0 The price of gas can vary with the supply, which can be affected by production snags like the weather. They can be affected by geopolitical issues like the Ukraine War and sanctions against Russia.\u00a0 Gasoline prices have been all over the place as we transition to renewable energy.\u00a0 Getting back to wages, companies are loathed to raise wages rapidly as they want to avoid having to cut them later at a greater cost to their employee's morale. Consumers today have probably been a bit more tolerant of slower wage increases because many of them received stimulus payments during the pandemic. The bottom line is we have gone through a period that has reduced our standard of living and inflation continues outpacing wage growth.\u00a0 Until the government gets the inflation rate at or below its 2% goal, the reduction of our standard of living will continue and it will affect those at the lower and middle-income levels the most.\nThe Ugly.\u00a0The latest 10-year projection for the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is a train wreck for our deficit and resulting national debt.\u00a0 The CBO regularly publishes reports presenting the baseline projections of what the federal budget and the economy would look like in the current year and over the next ten years if current laws governing taxes and spending generally remained unchanged.\u00a0 This was the latest report issued in February.\u00a0 In its projections, the federal deficit totals $1.4 trillion in 2023 and averages $2.0 trillion per year from 2024 to 2033.\u00a0 Real GDP growth comes to a halt in 2023 and rebounds averaging 2.3% from 2024 to 2033.\u00a0 The deficits start at $1.4 trillion as previously mentioned and balloon to $2.7 trillion in 2033.\u00a0 The gross public debt which will end this year at $34.5 trillion ends the 2033 year at $52 trillion.\u00a0 Assuming an average interest rate of approximately 3%, annual debt service goes from a projected $640 billion this year to $1.429 trillion in 2033, accounting for over half of the deficit that year.\u00a0 Other interesting numbers in the study, Social Security payments go from a projected $1,336 billion this year to a projected $2,355 billion in 2033.\u00a0 Medicare goes from a projected $998 billion this year to $2 trillion in 2033.\u00a0 Medicaid goes from a projected $589 billion this year to a projected $879 billion in 2033.\u00a0 We are reaching a point where we cannot afford and yet no one seems to care or recognize the problem.\u00a0 The foregoing numbers are egregious and unsustainable.\nIn summary, retail sales driven by the consumer indicate a fairly strong economy, inflation is eroding our standard of living and our fiscal house is in disorder.\nThis article originally appeared on Columbia Daily Tribune: MacLellan: The Good, The Bad, The Ugly \u2013 February 2023",

    "summary": "Black Americans are the third-largest racial or ethnic group in the U.S., making up just over 12% of the population. But less than 3% of all businesses are Black-owned. Some places outperform others, however, when it comes to the prevalence, success, and financial health of Black-owned companies and business owners.\nIn celebration and recognition of Black History Month, SmartAsset analyzed the best places for Black entrepreneurs. We considered 39 of the largest metro areas across three categories and a total of nine metrics on topics such as the prevalence of Black-owned businesses, new business success, and income and job security. For more information on our data or how we put together our findings, read our Data and Methodology section below.\nSmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\nNote: Our rankings are based solely on business and employment data and do not take into account the social climate or other factors that may contribute to racial inequality in a place.\nThis is SmartAsset's second study on the best places for Black entrepreneurs. Check out the previous edition\u00a0here.\nKey Findings\nThe number of Black-owned businesses grew by more than 100% in some areas. The Toledo, Ohio, metro area, which ranks No. 33 on our list, has the highest percent change between 2018 and 2020 (107.76%). Toledo is followed by the No. 1 ranking Austin, Texas, metro area (88.27%) and the No. 25 ranking Providence, Rhode Island, metro area (65.46%).\nThe proportion of Black-owned businesses is more than double the national average in six areas. The Atlanta, Georgia, metro area has the highest percentage (7.42%). It is followed by the District of Columbia (7.01%); Virginia Beach, Virginia (6.83%); Memphis, Tennessee (6.42%); Richmond, Virginia (5.88%) and Charlotte, North Carolina (4.94%). An additional 14 metro areas exceed the national average of 2.44%.\nThe Seattle, Washington, metro area is the only Western metro area to crack the top 10. Six California and Oregon metro areas also made it into our list, but none rank higher than No. 18. All three Western states, however, can offer Black entrepreneurs potential opportunities to start a new business, with a startup early survival rate above 78%.\n1.\u00a0Austin-Round Rock-Georgetown, TX\nThe fourth-largest metro area in Texas has seen an 88.27% increase in the number of Black-owned businesses between 2018 and 2020 (ranking second-highest for this metric). In that fast-growing environment, more than a third of total businesses are younger than three years in the Austin metro area (ranking No. 1 for this metric). Additionally, the area does well for Black American job security, offering the lowest Black unemployment rate study-wide (6.6%).\n2.\u00a0Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia, NC-SC\nThe Charlotte, North Carolina, metro area has an above-average presence of Black-owned businesses (the sixth-highest percentage). Black entrepreneurs may also find a welcoming climate for new businesses, which make up 27.59% of all businesses here (10th-highest). Additionally, the startup early survival rate in the state as a whole is just over 82% (ranking No. 5 across the country).\n3.\u00a0Atlanta-Sandy Springs-Alpharetta, GA\nThe Atlanta, Georgia, metro area has the highest percentage of Black-owned businesses (7.42%, or 8,663 in total). And this number of Black-owned businesses has gone up by almost 17% between 2018 and 2020. For Black residents in the area, both the median Black household income ($60,966) and the Black unemployment rate (7.9%) rank in the top 10.\n4.\u00a0Boston-Cambridge-Newton, MA-NH\nWhile the Boston, Massachusetts, metro area doesn't have the highest percentage of Black-owned businesses, the area has seen major growth over the past two years. Between 2018 and 2020, the number of Black-owned businesses has increased by more than 36% (fifth-highest increase). Additionally, close to 70% of all businesses in the area report sales and receipts exceeding $250,000 (11th-highest).\n5.\u00a0Washington-Arlington-Alexandria, DC-VA-MD-WV\nThe District of Columbia metro area, which offers destinations highlighting the contributions of Black Americans (such as the Smithsonian's museum of African American history), also ranks near the top for Black entrepreneurship. The prevalence of Black-owned businesses ranks in the top five - both as a percent (7.01%) and as a gross figure (7,933). For additional context, this figure is up 11.04% between 2018 and 2020.\n6.\u00a0Indianapolis-Carmel-Anderson, IN\nHome to the Landmark of Peace memorial, the Indianapolis, Indiana, metro area also offers an environment conducive to Black entrepreneurs. Approximately 3.25% of businesses are Black-owned, which has gone up 32.50% between 2018 and 2020 (sixth-highest increase). And with nearly 14% of all businesses being younger than three years in this metro area, it's reassuring that Indiana as a whole has a startup early survival rate of 83.59% - third-highest in the nation.\n7.\u00a0Miami-Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach, FL\nThe epicenter of South Florida has a solid presence of Black entrepreneurs. Recent data shows there are roughly 7,072 Black-owned businesses in the area, which make up close to 4% of all businesses. This is an increase of more than 16% over the two-year time period between 2018 and 2020. The Miami, Florida, metro area also offers a business environment that is welcoming for new business owners: 30.35% of all businesses are younger than three years.\n8.\u00a0Huntsville, AL\nThere are roughly 295 Black-owned businesses in the Huntsville, Alabama, metro area, which is the lowest number in the top 10. However, relative to the total number of businesses in the area, Huntsville is on par with larger metro areas: roughly 3.7% are Black-owned (12th-highest). Over the two-year period between 2018 and 2020, the number of Black-owned businesses in the area has increased by 37.21% (fourth-highest). Additionally, Huntsville has the second-lowest Black unemployment rate study-wide (7.1%).\n9.\u00a0Raleigh-Cary, NC\nThe Raleigh-Cary, North Carolina, metro area is located in a state with the fifth-highest startup early survival rate (82.74%). As can be expected, new businesses within the metro area have a noteworthy presence - more than 1 in 4 businesses is younger than three years (11th-highest). Black-owned businesses also make up 3.52% of all businesses (or in gross figures, just under 1,000 businesses) in the Raleigh-Cary area.\n10.\u00a0Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue, WA\nThe Seattle, Washington, metro area ranks No. 17 for both its total number of Black-owned businesses (1,269) and the two-year growth between 2018 and 2020 for the aforementioned figure (18.05%). Additionally, Black workers in the area earn the sixth-highest median household income study-wide ($63,155). As a whole, Washington state offers a startup climate that can benefit early survival - more than 89% of new businesses are still active after one year of operation (ranking No. 1).\nData and Methodology\nTo find the best places for Black entrepreneurs, SmartAsset looked at the 200 largest metro areas in the U.S. Only 39 of those areas had complete data available, and we compared them across three categories that include nine individual metrics:\nPrevalence of Black-owned businesses. For our Black-owned business success score, we analyzed the number of Black-owned businesses, two-year change in number of Black-owned businesses and percentage of Black-owned businesses. Data comes from the Census Bureau's Annual Business Surveys and is for the years 2018 and 2020.\nNew business success. This category includes the percentage of new businesses, startup survival rate and percentage of businesses with sales exceeding $250,000. Data comes from the Census Bureau's Annual Business Survey (2020) and the Kaufmann Indicators of Entrepreneurship report (2021). Note: The metric startup survival rate is reported at the state level.\nIncome and job security. To create this score, we looked at the median Black household income, 2021 Black unemployment rate and November 2022 unemployment rate. Data comes from the Census Bureau's 2021 1-year American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Local Area Unemployment Statistics program.\nFirst, we ranked each metro area in each metric, assigning equal weight to every metric. Then we averaged the rankings across the three categories listed above. For each category, the metro area with the highest average ranking received a score of 100. The metro area with the lowest average ranking received a score of 0. We created our final ranking by calculating each metro area's average score for all three categories.\nFinancial Tips for Black Entrepreneurs\nUnderstand the tax benefits and implications for business owners.

    "summary": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan.\nJerome Powell calmed the horses, a bit.\nIn attempting to parse last week's blockbuster January jobs report, the Federal Reserve Chair on Tuesday reprised his take from last Wednesday's policy meeting - essentially that another couple of Fed rate hikes were probably needed to get across inflation fully, but that it was anyone's guess after that.\nAny fear of a radical Fed rethink on the back of the jobs numbers seemed wide of the mark.\nAfter doubting Fed guidance all year, financial markets have taken one look at the strength of the labour market last month and stopped fighting the central bank. They now agree that two more quarter point hikes to just above 5% are in the pipeline by July - jarring stock and bond markets for a couple of days, but not much more.\nDespite some high-octane hawkishness from his colleagues - several more of whom are speaking on Wednesday - Powell seemed to reassure investors with some basic honesty about the peculiarity of this business cycle - and the dangers of extrapolating too much from a few data points or overcommitting on future policy moves.\n\"This cycle is different from other cycles...it has just confounded all sorts of attempts to predict,\" Powell admitted.\nThere's little doubt that second-guessing recession probabilities over recent months or staying wedded too long fixed assumptions has been less than rewarding. And many think last week's jobs report should similarly be treated with care.\n\"We believe the data last week does not accurately reflect the U.S. economy. It isn't booming, although it clearly isn't on the verge of recession either,\" Columbia Threadneedle Investments economist Steven Bell wrote on Wednesday.\nThe upshot is markets are back in wait-and-see mode. Wall St futures have given back a little of Tuesday's surge. Two and 10-year Treasury yields and the dollar edged back lower.\nThe VIX gauge of U.S. stock volatility remains unusually low, below 19 and below its average of the past 30 years.\nElsewhere, investors digested President Joe Biden's State of the Union speech, in which he challenged Republicans to lift the U.S. debt ceiling and support tax policies that were friendlier to middle class Americans.\nBiden hammered corporations for profiteering from the pandemic and ran through a wish list of economic proposals, many of which are unlikely to be passed by Congress. They included a minimum tax for billionaires and a quadrupling of the tax on corporate stock buybacks.\nBut the U.S. president was especially critical of oil companies' profits on the back of Ukraine's invasion. \"I think it's outrageous,\" Biden said.\nAnd the scale of 'Big Oil's' windfall last year was in evidence around the world yet again on Wednesday.\nNorway's Equinor posted a record $74.9 billion adjusted operating profit for 2022, more than double its previous high, as gas prices soared - boosting its share price by 7%. French oil major TotalEnergies posted record net profits of $36.2 billion, also double the previous year.\nIn tech, Microsoft Corp said it was revamping its Bing search engine and Edge Web browser with artificial intelligence, signaling its ambition to retake the lead in consumer technology markets where it has fallen behind.\nAnd in global central banking, Fed hawks weren't alone. The Reserve Bank of India hiked its key repo rate by a quarter percentage point and surprised markets by leaving the door open to more tightening, saying core inflation remained high.\nKey developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Wednesday:\n* U.S. December wholesale trade sales\n* New York Federal Reserve President John Williams, Fed Board Governor Lisa Cook, Fed Board Governor Christopher Waller, Fed Vice Chair for Supervision Michael Barr, Atlanta Fed chief Raphael Bostic, Minneapolis Fed chief Neel Kashkari\n* U.S. Treasury auctions 10-year notes\n* U.S. corp earnings: Disney, CVS, Fox Corp, Uber, CME, Brookfield AM, Emerson Electric, Dominion Energy, MGM resorts, Everest Re, Equifax, Yum!

    "summary": "Feb. 25\u2014100 Years Ago\nFeb. 25, 1923\nThis date was a Sunday. The Frederick News-Post did not publish a Sunday edition at this time.\n40 Years Ago\nFeb. 25, 1983\nFive rabid raccoons were found in the southeastern part of Frederick County in the past two days, Dr. Martha T. Schipper, the county health officer, said Thursday. \"There's no question this is an epidemic,\" she said. \"So far this year, we've had nine cases and this brings it to 14.\" A researcher at the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta said Thursday the rabies epidemic in the mid-Atlantic states is the worst in the nation in two decades.\nThe proposed 1984 Frederick Community College budget asks the county for than the 5 percent funding \"cap\" encouraged by the county commissioners. \"It does exceed the county mark,\" FCC President Jack B. Kussmaul acknowledged, \"but it's the first time in three years.\"\n(Editor's Note: The News-Post does not have access to archives from 50 years ago for August 1972 through March 1973. The \"50 Years Ago\" summary will return April 1, 2023.)\n20 Years Ago\nFeb. 25, 2003\nThe Frederick County Commissioners emerged from a short, closed session on Monday and appointed Donna Crook to fill the vacant seat on the Frederick County Board of Education. Ms. Crook's appointment had the support of all five commissioners.\nAs the City of Frederick takes on the task of rewriting its taxicab ordinance, questions remain about the extent of the city's future involvement regulating the industry as well as solutions for the city's lack of available drivers. The city's taxicab commission met Monday, its first meeting since the summer of 2000, to discuss a 1999 draft of the ordinance as well as possible incentives to increase the number of drivers and, perhaps, the number of permits issued for taxicabs.\n100 Years Ago\nFeb. 26, 1923\nThe entire town of Emmitsburg was alarmed when a motorcycle caught fire in front of the Emmitsburg Motor Company Sunday. The machine, driven by Clarence Shaffer, York, Pa., was being filled with gas in front of the garage when it suddenly caught fire. The tank on the machine exploded and it was feared that the flames would spread to the large tank in front of the garage. An explosion of this tank would have endangered the entire town. The Emmitsburg Fire Company was summoned and the flames extinguished without causing much damage to property in Emmitsburg.\nThe cold snap of the past week seemingly has given way to a spell of warm spring weather. Saturday was a pleasant contrast to the preceding days and Sunday was just like a day of early spring. All day southerly winds blew over the hills and valleys of Frederick county causing the snow and ice to melt and giving the entire atmosphere the tinge of spring.\n40 Years Ago\nFeb. 26, 1983\nFrederick City Historic District Commission (HDC) members Friday found several areas of concern with the city's proposed plans for the Court Street parking garage, and voted to continue discussion on the matter until new architectural drawings are made. HDC members expressed disapproval of the \"horizontal lines\" in the building's architecture, planters on each level and a concrete block facing West Patrick Street.\nSeveral radio stations in Western Maryland will not broadcast regional or state high school basketball games because of the Maryland Public Secondary Schools Athletic Association decision to charge fees to broadcasters. \"One again, the state of Maryland has notified broadcasters at the last minute of what we feel is an exorbitant fee for regional and state basketball playoffs,\" said Tom O'Rourke, sports director of WCDC in Cumberland. \"This is an attempt to penalize rural broadcasters,\" he said. \"The stations in the big city markets don't cover high school games.\"\n(Editor's Note: The News-Post does not have access to archives from 50 years ago for August 1972 through March 1973. The \"50 Years Ago\" summary will return April 1, 2023.)\n20 Years Ago\nFeb. 26, 2003\nThe Frederick County Commissioners were advised Tuesday to delay funding for nearly every Frederick County school construction and renovation project, trashing the county's approved six-year budget outline and the Board of Education's subsequent spending strategy.\nAlmost two yeas after a 90-day building moratorium was imposed by then-Mayor Jim Grimes because of strained water supplies, Frederick is still under a construction ban and is likely to stay there for several weeks longer. Last year's drought is over and the all remaining water restrictions were lifted last week, but city officials say that won't solve Frederick's problems. Mayor Jennifer Dougherty said the ban will be lifted only when the city finds another source of water, probably in late April when it gets a permanent permit for Well No. 4, hastily drilled last summer in the midst of the drought.",

Designed in collaboration with Bill Nicholson, MD, Director of Interventional Cardiology at Emory Healthcare, Atlanta, GA, the Triumph\u2122 Catheter features a unique design with six wire exit ports for precise wire advancement and clear visualization.\u00a0\u00a0 'In complex cases, the ability to better navigate tortuous anatomy has long been a challenge,' said Dr. Nicholson. 'The Triumph\u2122 Catheter's nitinol ports and cage bring navigation and control to a new level, and I am excited that Teleflex will enable interventional cardiologists to readily access this important technology.'\nThe GuideLiner\u00ae Coast\u2122 Catheter adds a hydrophilic option to Teleflex's market-leading guide extension portfolio\u2014anchored by the flagship GuideLiner\u00ae V3 Catheter\u2014enabling physicians to select the level of deliverability and backup support needed for specific cases.1 Earlier this year, the GuideLiner\u00ae Coast\u2122 Catheter was first used in a clinical procedure at the UW Medicine Heart Institute in Seattle, Washington.\n'Teleflex is committed to providing more options in the cath lab to help interventionalists address the specific needs of their patients,' said Scott Holstine, President and General Manager of Teleflex's Interventional business unit. 'The Triumph\u2122 Catheter and the GuideLiner\u00ae Coast\u2122 Catheter reflect our focus on providing physicians with new choices and technologies engineered to address unmet clinical needs, personal preference and technique, and the challenges of complex anatomy.'\nThe GuideLiner\u00ae Coast\u2122 Catheter is currently in a limited market release phase, with full market release anticipated later this year.

    "summary": "A look at the day ahead in U.S. and global markets from Mike Dolan\nFor markets increasingly wary of the inflation and interest rate implications of re-accelerating world growth, the positive of a new burst of economic confidence in the tech sector adds some cheer at least.\nThe new year craze in artificial intelligence and chatbots seems to have electrified chip designer Nvidia, whose stock surged more than 8% before the bell after it forecast first-quarter revenue above Wall St estimates late Wednesday.\nIts CEO Jensen Huang said use of its chips to power AI had \"gone through the roof in the last 60 days.\"\nThe world's largest supplier of chips used in data centers for training AI has become a key hardware supplier for large tech companies such as Microsoft Corp that are building services like chat-powered search engines.\nChip stocks rose around the world on Thursday in the slipstream of Nvidia's earnings report. S&P500 stock futures jumped about 0.5% and back above 4,000 points ahead of the open.\nIf the AI boom is one vignette in a world economy that appears to be skirting widely-forecast recession and regenerating some momentum, then the interest rate implications are considerable - not just in how high they go, but how long they stay up there.\nThe Federal Reserve at least seems keen on the higher-for-longer message that's shaken world stock and bond markets this week.\nWhile most Fed policymakers rallied behind a decision to further slow the pace of interest rate hikes at its last policy meeting - suggesting some still saw another half-point rate rise as warranted - minutes from the meeting showed they all saw curbing unacceptably high inflation as the \"key factor\".\nBond yields rose following the release of the minutes and the U.S. dollar also advanced.\nAnd as the minutes pre-date red-hot jobs and retail data for January, the message from Fed officials is probably even sterner now. New York Federal Reserve Bank President John Williams on Wednesday said the Fed is \"absolutely\" committed to bringing inflation back down to its 2% target over the next few years, by bringing demand down in line with constrained supply.\nThe signals from other central banks were similar. Bank of England interest rate-setter Catherine Mann said on Thursday that it was too soon to sound the all clear on inflation and the BoE should continue to raise borrowing costs.\nInvestors seem to be taking all that on board. A Reuters poll of equity analysts showed global stock markets are expected to correct in the next three months.\nThe Feb. 10-22 poll of more than 150 strategists, analysts and fund mangers covering 17 global stock indices, found that 56% were expecting their local market to fall in the next three months. A total of 48 out of 86 respondents said the chances of a correction were either high or very high.\nBut well chosen recovery stocks continue to do well. British engineering firm Rolls-Royce surged 18.1% on Thursday after the company's CEO forecast more profit growth in 2023 after last year's beat. A key factor was optimism around civil aerospace, the firm's biggest division, as travel recovers from the pandemic.\nKey developments that may provide direction to U.S. markets later on Thursday:\n* US Q4 GDP revision and corporate profits estimate; weekly jobless claims; Kansas City Fed Feb business index; Chicago Fed Jan business index\n* San Francisco Federal Reserve President Mary Daly, Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic speak; Bank of Spain Governor Pablo Hernandez de Cos speaks\n* G20 finance ministers and central bankers meet in Bengaluru in southern India; Japan chairs separate G7 finance chiefs meeting\n* U.S. Treasury sells 7-year notes\n* U.S. corp earnings: Intuit, Edison, Booking, Moderna, Alliant Energy, Autodesk, Teleflex, Newmont, Warner Bros Discovery, PG&E, Domino's, American Tower, American Electric Power, Keurig Dr Pepper, CBRE, Evergy etc\nGRAPHICS:U.S. natural gas prices drop lowest since Sept. 2020 https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-NATGAS/zjvqjykmxpx/chart.png\nUS mortgage demand growth https://www.reuters.com/graphics/USA-STOCKS/zdvxdxobdvx/mba.png\n2022 was worst year for chip stocks since 2008 crisis https://www.reuters.com/graphics/TEXASINSTRUMENT-RESULTS/jnvwywdxqvw/chart.png\nBanking on value https://www.reuters.com/graphics/GLOBAL-MARKETS/znpnbxewzpl/chart.png\n(By Mike Dolan, editing by Christina Fincher mike.dolan@thomsonreuters.com.

    "summary": "Showcasing a Sophisticated Design for a Flexible, Modern Way of Working\nNEW YORK, Feb. 27, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Peter Gaslow, President and CEO of Empire Office, Inc. (www.empireoffice.com), announces the launch of Empire's new headquarters in New York City, located at 654 Madison Avenue. On the 14th floor, the space was designed with the architecture and design teams at VMAD and inspired by industry trends and the new way of working. With an emphasis on touch-down (versus dedicated) spaces and hosting client and team meetings in an open, flexible and amenity-filled space, the newly launched HQ is also home to Empire's executive leadership team.\n\"During the pandemic, we found ourselves where most companies did \u2013 working remotely,\" stated Gaslow. \"For a company specializing in furniture for office spaces, this could not be farther from what we expected to see looking into our future. Like the clients we support, we knew we belonged back in the office, so we began searching for a new space to support us now and into the future.\"\nThe search led to 654 Madison Avenue, just 30 blocks north of the company's previous location and conveniently situated near Central Park, the Queensboro bridge, and a short distance from most trains and transit.\n\"The building's mid-century design and boutique nature nestled within a luxe shopping district, not to mention a few blocks from the Steelcase showroom, made it the perfect choice for us,\" said Jocelyn Corrigan, Chief Strategy Officer.\nTogether with the team at VMAD, Empire got to work creating an executive hub with eight private offices, including a CEO suite; reservable workstations; a variety of conference room sizes and open collaboration spaces; custom work pods; a phone nook; a mother's retreat; and an inspirational workroom housing the Creative Studio and Marketing teams.\n\"Our goal was to build a more purposeful and targeted space that mirrors our brand and showcases how the workplace is evolving,\" added Corrigan. \"We took the time to examine our needs, wants, and desires for our next HQ space in both location and amenities. Flexibility, employee well-being, and collaboration emerged as the key driving factors.\"\nThe style of the space is Scandinavian-modern, reflected in impressive marble stone slabs, arched doorways, rich velvets, wood slats, brass accents, and a sophisticated color palette with over a dozen brands represented, including Steelcase, Coalesse, Stylex, Watson, Allermuir, Andreu World, Hem, Menu, Viccarbe, Nucraft, Spacestor, Heartwork, Minotti, Tuohy, West Elm Work, and many more.\nEmpire's custom millwork division, Fabricate, crafted one-of-a-kind furniture and built-in solutions that blend with the furniture selections for a unique but uniform look and feel. Fabricate's engineers developed shop drawings based on the conceptual renderings from the VMAD team and sourced multiple material samples to match the furniture in the space. Signature pieces include large-scale sliding entry doors, a custom stone reception desk, upholstered benches and banquettes, custom velvet-wrapped work pods, built-in pantry cabinetry and stone tops, and a curved wooden portal.\nThe result is a welcoming environment that promotes socialization and draws in employees, partners, clients, and visitors.\n\"Today's workplaces demand flexibility with a balance of open and private spaces, fostering collaborative and individual work needs that can change at a moment's notice, and our space is no different,\" said Gaslow. \"Our teams are very pleased with the outcome and the opportunity to see and collaborate with colleagues again in person. It's a great time to be back in the office.\"\nIn December, Empire Office celebrated one-year post-acquisition of DeKalb Office, which expanded its reach in the Southeastern U.S. with physical locations in Atlanta, GA, and Birmingham, AL. The company's client list now boasts 41 of the top 100\u00a0Fortune500\u00a0companies in the U.S.\nAbout Empire Office, Inc.\nNew York-headquartered Empire Office is the world's largest commercial furniture & interior solutions provider, with over 77 years of experience.

    "excerpt": "A tour through this year's Milwaukee Autoshow, in its 116th year.",
    "summary": "'Beep, beep, who got the keys to the Jeep?', or so sings rapper Missy Elliott.\nYou may not have the keys now, but car makers are hoping you will later this year, after checking out a new model at the Milwaukee International Autoshow.\nThousands of people have poured into the Wisconsin Center in downtown Milwaukee for this year's display, which began in 1907 and has been running consistently since 1986.\nThe show, a large-scale vehicle marketing event, is put on by the Automobile Dealers Association of Mega Milwaukee and runs for about two weeks, through March 5. Cars are not sold at the show; patrons can browse at their own pace, but experts for each make and models are ready to share details and answer questions.\nIt offers spectators \u2014 car enthusiasts and novices alike \u2014 the opportunity to check out hundreds of new cars, trucks, vans, and SUVs from 22 brands all in one place. While electric versions of old favorites have a spotlight at this year's show, there is a range for everyone, including gas-powered and hybrid vehicles.\nCurious about the spaciousness of the Jeep Wagoneer? Come in, spread out, stay awhile in the 2024 model that is being brought back after debuting in 1963.\nInterested in a 'frunk?' (yes, that's a trunk in the front) Ford has you covered, literally. You can stash your stuff in its 2024 electric Mustang Mach-E frunk, or, its F-150 Lightning frunk, an electric truck where you can party in the front and the back.\nConsidering a puppy to accompany your all-wheel-drive? Play with a puppy along with a Forester at the dog pen set up amid Subaru's new vehicles. Puppies available for adoption from Underdog Pet Rescue in Madison are available throughout the show.\n'It's like you're getting a look into the future,' said DeeDee Taft, a spokeswoman for the event. The models on display are pre-production, 2024 editions, meaning they will hit lots later this year.\nExit polling from last year's event showed that 20% of attendees were actively shopping for new vehicles and 55% said they planned to purchase a new vehicle within the year.\nThis year's show is the most open since the pandemic and people have been eager to come see autos in person, to physically sit inside the cars and peruse the latest features, said Brian Moody, executive editor of the Kelly Blue Book, who is based in Atlanta.\nWhile electric cars make up about 5% of the market, there is raft of new technology across models and makes that are non-electric, he said.\n'Wireless is a big deal,' he said. There is wireless charging, wireless Apple Car Play, WiFi hotspot, and 'heads up display' in cars where the speed is projected onto the windshield.\n'So you can just be driving straight ahead, you don't have to look down' to check your speed,' he said.\nSupply chain constraints generally have leveled off some from the pandemic, but the availability of a vehicle today depends on a series of factors.\n'In general, yes, people can get the car that they want but when you start looking model by model for example the Ford Maverick is a very popular compact pickup you might have to wait,' Moody said. 'Based on popularity supply and demand works just how supply and demand works.'\nThe new car supply is increasing and is about double what it was about a year ago and while average prices on new cars have increased, that does not mean all new cars are more expensive.\nA bigger percentage of new car buyers are buying luxury cars, about 20%, Moody said. Others are paying well over sticker price for in-demand vehicles.\n'That effects an average quite a bit,' he said. 'Don't be afraid of the prices because some are high, and some are moderate.'\nFor prospective buyers who want to experience the road behind the wheel of the car they've been pining for, the auto show offers test drives of several models, including Dodge, Jeep and Chrysler.\nThat's what Andy Mendizabal and his daughter, Sophia, 10 were waiting to do at the show's kickoff weekend. The pair traveled up from Racine to check out the latest models, including the electric Dodge Charger Scat Pack, the old-school muscle car.\nCuriosity, along with the wide-bodied car's 70's style and 485 horsepower engine, intrigued him, he said.\nHe drives a 2013 Ford Mustang now but appreciates the style of the Challenger. 'Just curiosity,' he said when asked why he wanted to test drive. He's enjoyed the show, he said, it was worth the trip.\n'It was nice to see all the different brands instead of going to a dealer.'\nThis article originally appeared on Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Milwaukee Autoshow shows new off electric vehicles, new models",

    "summary": "Early Childhood Education Franchise to Open First School in North Carolina Fueling Statewide Franchise Development\nCARY, N.C., Feb. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Celebree School, a leader in early childhood education that provides infant and toddler care, preschool, before and aftercare, and summer camp programs, is rolling out an aggressive corporate hub strategy as the emerging franchise brand expands beyond its home state into new markets across the country. The first corporate school to debut under this strategic growth initiative is Celebree School of Cary, as company executives see vast franchise growth potential across the state.\nThe new corporate-owned school is slated to open Q4 2023 at 11550 Green Level Church Rd. As the first location to open in North Carolina, Celebree School looks to grow and enhance brand awareness while awarding franchise agreements in key markets across the state, including the Raleigh-Durham DMA that can boast 18 locations and the greater Charlotte market that has the opportunity for 16 schools. Celebree School recently opened in Fort Mill, SC, servicing the Charlotte DMA as the brand continues to ramp up expansion efforts.\nAs Celebree School seeds the market with a corporate hub, the brand will have the opportunity to truly become a local expert. Not only will this aid in identifying prime areas for growth, but it will also play a critical role in recruitment, enrollment, and training as part of franchisee onboarding and opening.\n\"This is an exciting chapter in our brand's growth journey,\" said Richard Huffman, Founder and CEO of Celebree School. \"With a 28-plus-year history, we've built an incredible infrastructure for growth and are now strategically expanding across the country with like-minded franchisees who believe in our brand and our mission.

All corporate locations are projected to open by the end of 2024 with the intent to help drive franchise growth. These development efforts contribute to Celebree School's aggressive expansion goal of opening 150 new schools over the next three years.\nToday, Celebree has 26 corporate schools, 13 franchise locations, and 90-plus in various stages of development. As franchise development continues to surge, Celebree School is looking for qualified and engaged individuals seeking single and multi-unit opportunities who are involved in their community, have a passion for childhood education, and are eager to explore the world of franchising.\nCelebree School lives by its promise to Grow People Big and Small\u2122, and was founded on the belief that success in early childhood development is equal parts curriculum and a connection that extends beyond the classroom to address the needs of the whole child and the whole family. Each Celebree School is a village made up of parents, children, and educators with a focus on curriculum-based care that prepares your child for kindergarten and beyond.\nPrograms are available for children six weeks to 12-years-old with unique curriculums designed to develop positive social skills and values while allowing children to learn about their world through age-appropriate play, projects, and activities. Care is available part-time or full-time, and parents are allowed to drop in and visit at any time.\nWhen franchisees invest with Celebree School, they're investing in an organization with a strong culture, solid systems, and a proven business model backed with 28-plus years of experience in providing exceptional early childhood education.

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Norfolk Southern Corp.'s top executive was dragged before Congress a second time this week to answer for the train crash and chemical spill that forced the temporary evacuation of a small Ohio town last month.\n\n\nUBS Sends Khan to Stem Credit Suisse's Private Banker Exits\nJack Dorsey's Wealth Tumbles $526 Million After Hindenburg Short\nJack Dorsey's Block Vows to Fight Back After Hindenburg Says It's Short the Stock\n\nDespite the political uproar, many industry watchers say it's increasingly likely the railroad operator will face few financial penalties. Even the threat of more federal regulation wouldn't affect Norfolk Southern any differently than its peers.\nThat message has been slow to resonate on Wall Street, where Norfolk Southern shares have lost a fifth of their value since the accident, a significant drop in the typically staid industry.\n'The share reaction to the derailment has been a complete overreaction,' said Jason Seidl, an analyst with TD Cowen, in an interview. 'In the long run, Norfolk and the other rails are expected to see strong growth. So, if you are a long-term investor, this is a buying opportunity.'\nNorfolk Southern has been the target of withering criticism after a 149-car train derailed on Feb. 3 in East Palestine, Ohio, dumping ethylhexyl acrylate, isobutylene and other chemicals into soil and local waterways. The damage was exacerbated after authorities decided to vent and burn five railcars containing vinyl chloride on Feb. 6 out of concern that the contents were heating up and could explode. Still, the derailment caused no fatalities nor direct injuries, which would have escalated the severity.\nThe Atlanta-based railroad has insurance that will cushion the blow of remediation expenses, which include $24 million spent so far to support local residents whose jobs were disrupted. Bloomberg Intelligence estimates Norfolk Southern will spend somewhere between $150 million and $250 million fixing the mess, a majority of which may be the actual cleanup. Environmental fines for similar accidents have been in the multimillion-dollar range. Ohio has sued the company seeking unspecified damages but that isn't expected to add significantly to costs.\nIf insurance coverage applies, Bloomberg Intelligence estimates the total hit to Norfolk Southern's earnings per share would be just 25 cents this year, or less than 2%. Norfolk Southern's operating profit was $4.8 billion in 2022.\n'Over the next six to nine months, people are going to evaluate Norfolk's stock on the fundamentals and I don't think this unfortunate event is part of the fundamental story of the company,' said Amit Mehrotra, an analyst with Deutsche Bank.\nThe disconnect between the market's reaction and analysts' appraisal of the derailment can be partly explained by videos of smoke billowing from the wreckage that went viral after the accident, sparking national news coverage and outrage on social media. US political polarization, which has grown more extreme since the 2016 election, further fueled the flames as lawmakers competed to condemn the incident and highlight the plight of forgotten folks in rural Ohio.\nTo get ahead of lawmakers, Norfolk Southern committed to a six-point safety plan that includes adding hundreds of heat sensors alongside rail tracks. CEO Alan Shaw told a Senate committee on March 22 that the company supports more regulation, including higher standards on tank cars, a review of safety measures every three years, and providing first responders with more information on the contents of trains passing through their communities. The company has also made unprecedented pledges to reimburse lost property value related to the derailment and to set up a long-term medical fund.\nThose pledges and Shaw's public apologies have defused calls for him or any other executives to step down in the wake of the accident.\n'I'm terribly sorry for the derailment in East Palestine and we're working every day to make Norfolk Southern and the rail industry safer,' Shaw told lawmakers. 'Norfolk Southern is here for the long haul and we won't be finished until we make this right.'\nThe long-term initiatives will drive up Norfolk Southern's costs and weigh on earnings, according to John Eade, an analyst at Argus Research. Cargo volumes will be curtailed as the railroad rips up track on its mainline that passes through East Palestine to remove contaminated soil underneath. That work, which will be done on one of the two sets of tracks at a time to keep trains moving, will take about eight weeks to complete, Norfolk Southern has said.\n'They will struggle with earnings growth for pretty much the rest of the year,' Eade said in an interview. Earlier this month he cut his rating on Norfolk Southern shares to hold from buy, the only downgrade so far since the accident.\nFederal regulators have also opened broader investigations into the company's culture and safety practices following a series of recent incidents involving the railroad.\nTrains derail about 1,000 times a year in the US, which is half the rate from two decades ago. In particularly bad crashes, including fatal ones, any impact on the stock price has usually disappeared within a year. That was the case in 2005 when two Norfolk Southern trains collided and released chlorine gas in Graniteville, South Carolina, killing nine people. Shares of CSX Corp. were only temporarily impacted in 2014 when a train spilled oil in downtown Lynchburg, Virginia, causing a fire and partial evacuation. And Union Pacific Corp.'s shares were outperforming the broader market a year after a collision near San Antonio released chlorine gas and killed three people, including the train's conductor.\nThese incidents, like the one in East Palestine, spurred calls for more oversight. Historically the costs to implement new safety measures have been shared among all railroads, not just the company with the most recent accident. In some cases, it's been the tank-car makers and shippers that have borne the brunt of the expenses, rather than the railroads.\nHistory also shows that demand for rail isn't affected by accidents. There's no better way to haul chemicals or other bulky goods since trains are much safer than trucks and emit a fraction of the greenhouse gases. Norfolk Southern operates in the eastern U.S. and has only one major competitor, CSX.\nAustin Graff, founder and chief investment officer at Opal Capital, says railroads are generally considered to be high-quality businesses, and occasional fines and minor regulatory changes are to be expected. Neither will put Norfolk Southern out of business, he said.\n'Many value investors prefer to buy into bad news situations, understanding that the current perception is likely transitory,' Graff said. 'When the narrative improves the company will likely trade much higher.'\n Businessweek\n\n\n\nChatGPT Advances Are Moving So Fast Regulators Can't Keep Up\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "summary": "In this article, we will discuss the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks. If you want to see more companies in this selection, go to the 5 .\nThere has been a global energy crisis since the start of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. European countries realized they heavily relied on Russian natural gas and crude oil and needed to transition away from these sources to reduce their dependence. During the conflict, the price of crude oil and natural gas spiked significantly due to global uncertainty, and the importance of oil and gas supply took center stage in the political landscape. As a result, there has been an acceleration in the installation of renewable energy resources. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), the capacity growth of renewable energy is set to double in the next five years. During this process, renewable energy sources will overtake coal and become the biggest energy source for the generation of electricity.\nThe IEA anticipates the capacity of renewable energy to grow by 2,400 gigawatts (GW) during the 2022 to 2027 period. The increase in the capacity growth of renewable energy is 30% higher than the forecast one year ago. This reflects the positive intent of governments around the world on transforming towards renewable energy sources. The IEA also notes that 90% of the increase in electricity capacity globally will be done through renewable sources, and as a result, renewable energy will become the biggest source of electricity generation by early 2025. IEA Director Fatih Birol shared that in the next five years, the world will add as much renewable energy as in the last two decades.\nBesides Europe, India, China, and the US are also aggressively pursuing the rollout of renewable energy at various levels. The 14th Five-Year Plan rolled out by China in January 2022 focuses on making China a behemoth in the field of renewable energy, as the country will be responsible for nearly 50% of new capacity additions through renewable energy during the 2022 to 2027 period. Meanwhile, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) passed in August 2022 in the US intends to provide long-term support to the aggressive expansion and adoption of renewable energy by various corporations. Meanwhile, India is also set to increase its investment in solar manufacturing by as much as $25 billion between 2022 to 2027. Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR), and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE) are some of the most profitable renewable energy stocks in the industry currently.\nermess/Shutterstock.com Our Methodology\nA thorough research was conducted on the renewable energy sector, including its current market trends, growth projections, and key players, to gain a comprehensive understanding of the industry and identify the most promising companies within it. We then shortlisted the 13 most profitable renewable energy stocks on the basis of their trailing 12 months' net income. We have included non-pure play companies in the list as well that have significant exposure to the renewable sector. The companies have been ranked in ascending order of their net income.\nTrailing 12 months Net Income: $1.91 billion\nEnbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is a Calgary, Alberta-based pipeline and energy company.\nThe company has invested more than $6 billion (C$8 billion) in renewable energy since its first investment in a wind farm back in 2002. Presently, the company produces 5,192 megawatts (MW) gross of zero-emission energy, which is enough to provide power to 969,000 homes. This makes Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) one of the biggest renewable energy companies in Canada. The company has deployed wind farms, solar energy operations, waste heat recovery facilities, geothermal projects, power transmission projects, and hydroelectric facilities to produce renewable energy. Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) is focused on becoming a net-zero emission entity by 2050 through these initiatives. The company has a headcount of over 12,000 employees, mainly across the US and Canada.\nHere's what ClearBridge Investments said about Enbridge Inc. (NYSE:ENB) in its Q3 2021 investor letter:\n'We are meaningfully overweight energy, particularly within North American energy infrastructure.\u00a0Enbridge\u00a0and Williams, our two infrastructure holdings, possess crown jewel infrastructure assets. They each deliver meaningful proportions of the overall energy produced and consumed in North America. Their revenues are backed by long-term contracts with high-quality counterparties and have little direct commodity price exposure. Their growth has been driven by the increasing production of North American energy. The advent of unconventional oil and gas production (oil sand and shale) has made North America a low-cost competitor on a global basis. We expect strong North American production to be an enduring feature of global energy supply for decades to come.'\nTrailing 12 months Net Income: $3.41 billion\nThe Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is an Atlanta, Georgia-based energy provider to homes and businesses.\nThe company is the holding entity for three vertically integrated state-regulated electric utilities that fulfill the needs of 9 million customers. Renewable energy accounts for 15% of the energy mix of The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) as of 2022. This reflects a significant change in the energy mix, as renewable energy was only responsible for 1% of the company's energy mix in 2007. The Southern Company (NYSE:SO) is also focused on becoming a net zero emissions entity by 2050. The company intends to achieve a power generation capacity of 17,000 MW through renewable sources by 2030 as opposed to 11,000 MW in 2021.

Centrais El\u00e9tricas Brasileiras S.A. - Eletrobr\u00e1s (XELTB.MC) further claims that 92% of its power generation is done through renewable sources like water, wind, and solar. The company intends to increase its installed capacity by 1 Gigawatt (GW) by the end of this decade. Meanwhile, the company's transmission business covers nearly half of the lines laid out in the country through its reach of 74,087 km of transmission lines.\nTrailing 12 months Net Income: $12.58 billion\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is an Austin, Texas-based maker of electric vehicles (EVs). The company, led by Elon Musk, is also a producer of batteries that can be charged from clean energy and provides solar energy solutions for residential and commercial customers.\nThe stock price of Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has more than doubled since its bottom in early January 2023. CEO Elon Musk has announced that he will reveal the 'Master Plan 3' during Investor Day on March 1, which will provide a way to achieve a completely sustainable energy future for the planet. Under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) introduced by the US government, Tesla, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model 3 and Model Y are also eligible for a $7,500 Federal Tax Credit.\nHere's what Baron Funds said about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n'Tesla, Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:TSLA) declined 54% in the quarter and detracted 26.62% from the Fund's overall performance. We initiated our position in Tesla in February 2014 at a split-adjusted price of $11.91. Over the subsequent two years, we acquired 16.65 million shares for an average split-adjusted price of $14.22. At the time of our final purchase in February 2016, the stock represented 9.6% of the Fund's total investments.\nTesla produced approximately 35,000 vehicles in 2014, the year of our initial purchase. In 2022, it produced 1.37 million vehicles. Not only has its production grown tremendously, but it has also significantly increased profitability per vehicle. Tesla has expanded from producing high performance electric vehicles for wealthy aficionados to a company that produces affordable luxury cars for a sizable audience. In turn, it has transformed its industry. Investors rewarded this expansion in both production and profits, and the stock price increased to $265.25 at the end of the third quarter. Since 2016, we sold 4.5 million shares, or 27.0% of the original holding, at an average price of $218.39.\nInvestors have recently become concerned about many external factors. Elon Musk is Tesla's founder and CEO. His purchase of Twitter has negatively impacted the perception of Tesla's brand in the short term. China's COVID policies and outbreak have paused purchases and production in the company's largest region. Global recessionary fears and upcoming Inflation Reduction Act incentives also caused some to delay new vehicle purchases in various markets\u2026' (Click here to read the full text)\nIn addition to Tesla, Inc.

    "excerpt": "In under three years, SPATCO has tripled EBITDA via organic growth and strategic acquisitions of complementary, market-leading businesses.CHARLOTTE, N.C. & ATLANTA, February 09, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)-\u2026",
    "summary": "In under three years, SPATCO has tripled EBITDA via organic growth and strategic acquisitions of complementary, market-leading businesses.\nCHARLOTTE, N.C. & ATLANTA, February 09, 2023--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Kian Capital-backed SPATCO Energy Solutions (\"SPATCO\"), a forward-thinking infrastructure services provider of innovative turnkey solutions for petroleum, environmental and EV market segments, completed the acquisition of Petro Supply, a leading distributor of petroleum equipment in the Mid-Atlantic region. Combined with the acquisition of McKinney Petroleum Equipment in January of 2023, the platform is expanding its geographic reach while bolstering its dominant stronghold in the Southeast.\nFounded in 1971 by Galen Heaps, Petro Supply specializes in the sale and distribution of petroleum equipment, including parts and materials for the construction and maintenance of gas stations, convenience stores and petroleum & chemical handling facilities. A family-owned and operated business, Galen's son Brandon Heaps worked side-by-side with his father to grow Petro Supply into one of the largest petroleum equipment distributors in the mid-Atlantic. The acquisition marks SPATCO's entry into the Maryland, DC, Pennsylvania, Delaware and New Jersey markets and introduces full-service capabilities to Petro Supply's established and prospective customer base.\n\"My father built Petro Supply on the foundation of hard work and two sayings \u2014 \u2018do what is right' and \u2018treat everyone as you want to be treated',\" said Brandon, who will lead SPATCO's Mid-Atlantic region. \"I am beyond proud of how we've grown the business together and excited to take Petro Supply to the next level with a partner who shares the same values and commitment to our people. As our industry evolves, we are confident in SPATCO's strategy and vision to continuously innovate to meet our customers' needs.\"\nEarlier this year, SPATCO completed the acquisition of McKinney Petroleum Equipment, a market-leading single-source petroleum provider in Alabama, further solidifying its position in the Southeast with a strong Gulf Coast presence. McKinney Petroleum President Kevin McKinney said, \"I'm excited to be a part of such a high-growth platform and look forward to leveraging SPATCO's resources, systems and expert training programs to build on our capabilities here in the Gulf Coast and beyond. As a third-generation family-owned business, it was important to align with a company that respected our history and would put our employees and customers first.

    "excerpt": "Rather than being threatening, New Era Detroit's open display of guns \u2014 broadly legal in Michigan \u2014 is hailed by many people for protecting Black women in dangerous neighborhoods at night.",
    "summary": "On the eve of Black History Month this year, a community group based in Detroit went viral after sharing clips on social media of its members, many dressed in all-black and armed with long rifles, assisting women around the city by pumping gas into their vehicles and loading groceries into their cars.\nThe group's open display of guns \u2014 broadly legal in Michigan \u2014 was greeted by many people not for being threatening but for protecting Black women in dangerous neighborhoods at night.\nThe group, New Era Detroit, has been carrying out this kind of public safety work in the city's most crime-ridden streets for almost a decade.\n'We do this out of love,' Nilajah Alonzo, one of the leaders of New Era Detroit, told Yahoo News.\nThe group's Instagram page includes videos of members escorting child care workers home late at night from a daycare only a block from where a murder had recently taken place. Another social media post shows members hosting a workshop with children on conflict resolution.\n'We're not trying to be crime heroes or anything like that,' Alonzo said. 'We're just trying to educate and uplift our community.'\nLaunched in August 2014, New Era Detroit was founded by Zeek Williams as a call to action for Black men in the city to step up and be more present to combat rampant crime and violence in poverty-stricken areas around the city. The appeal went out as muggings of women in and around grocery stores and gas stations were becoming more prevalent.\nThe group calls itself a 'mudroots' organization because of its approach.\n'We say \u2018mudroot,' because we get under the grass, we get into the mud, we get into the community, we get into the streets, we get into the 'hoods, to connect with people and engage with them,' Alonzo said. 'So they know that there are people out there that care.'\nIn the last decade, Detroit has consistently ranked as one of the most dangerous big cities in the U.S. In 2022, while preliminary police data showed an 11% reduction in violent crime over the previous year, carjackings increased by 21%, and other property crimes, including burglaries, saw a significant spike. In addressing these issues, the goal of New Era Detroit, according to Williams, has been predicated on the idea that with structure, Black people can protect and serve their own neighborhoods and streets.\n'We want to be in a position to where, if things pop off or something happens in our community, it doesn't always have to involve police,' Williams told MSNBC earlier this month, adding that the organization's members carry guns not to incite violence, but to protect innocent people. 'We believe that able-bodied men can step up to the plate and do more to police their community.'\nThe group has managed to maintain a working relationship with the city's police force.\n'We have a good relationship with New Era Detroit,' Detroit Police Department spokesperson Sgt. Jordan Hall told Yahoo News. 'We even have an understanding where they give us a call [ahead of events], so nothing should be alarming for officers when they see anyone with a rifle.'\nDetroit's challenges are complex and rooted in its Rust Belt history. Once the global center of the automotive industry, Detroit was the fourth-largest city in the U.S. in the 1920s. Its population ballooned to nearly 2 million residents at its peak in 1950. But automation curbed the blue-collar employment boom. Racial tensions grew, and deadly riots rocked the city in 1967, as tens of thousands of white residents left for the suburbs. Detroit struggled financially, and in 2013, it became the largest U.S. city to file for bankruptcy. Today, it has the highest rate of concentrated poverty of the 25 largest metropolitan areas in the United States.\nIn the past seven decades, the steady decline in the city's population, of which Black people make up 77%, has left the city with just a third of its peak total.\nIn a show of progress, the city has been working to turn itself around, with the emergence of new restaurants and bars, a growing art scene and a revitalized downtown area. But a study from Michigan State University revealed that much of the progress has been limited to a 7-square-mile radius, in a city of 139 square miles.\nThat leaves a wide swath of the city where residents feel they've been left behind.\n'We are looking at a system that really isn't broke. It just hasn't had us in mind \u2014 or protecting us in mind,' Williams told NBC. 'Why don't we do more to police our own communities?'\nMany people liken Williams's New Era Detroit to the original Black Panther Party, which grew out of the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Founded by Huey P. Newton and Bobby Seale in Oakland, Calif., in 1966, its intent was for Black residents to act as vigilantes in their own communities. As they evolved, the Panthers began to arm themselves, in a show of force, often dressed in a uniform of blue shirts, black pants, black leather jackets and black berets. However, unlike the Detroit organization, which seeks primarily to address issues like crime in its own community, the Black Panthers sought to protect Black residents from instances of police brutality.\n'The Panthers were really focused on potential police violence toward people in the community,' the journalist Mark Whitaker, author of 'Saying It Loud: 1966 \u2014 The Year Black Power Challenged the Civil Rights Movement,' told Yahoo News. 'New Era are just as concerned about the danger that ordinary, law-abiding citizens in the inner city face from other Black folks who might do them harm. \u2026 So for young people to help protect other people in the community, I think it's wonderful to see.'\nOther cities with similar challenges have taken notice. The original Detroit group, under the umbrella New Era Nation, has formed more than a dozen chapters, in cities including Dallas, Atlanta, Cleveland and Baltimore. The movement of self-sufficiency, according to Alonzo, has also attracted interest abroad, in Jamaica, the U.K. and Nigeria.\n'We are all leaders, and the opportunity is given to everyone to lead,' he said. 'We have chapters in every city, so it's not going to die with one person. We set up a structure that someone is in charge, no matter what. We appreciate that we are compared to other groups, but if we perpetuate that we are all leaders, it cannot die.'\nWhitaker cautions against scaling up too fast, too soon.\n'The lesson of the Black Power period is to stay local,' he said. 'That's where you can do the most good, and that's where people most need you, and people aren't being adequately served by police or local government.'\n_____\nCover thumbnail photo: Stephen Maturen/Getty Images",

Operating revenues for the full year were $29.3 billion, compared with $23.1 billion in 2021, an increase of 26.7 percent. These increases\u00a0were\u00a0primarily due to higher fuel costs.\n\"Southern Company enjoyed another successful year in 2022,\" declared Chairman, President and CEO, Thomas A.

    "excerpt": "The widespread adoption of digital payments, recovering cross-border travel and tech investments might drive the Financial Transaction Services space. Stocks like V, MA, FISV, GPN and EFX are poised\u2026",
    "summary": "The Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from growing transaction volumes, stemming from improved consumer spending and rebounding cross-border travels. Increased digitization across every sphere of life provides industry players with the perfect ground to capitalize on by leveraging their advanced digital prowess. Continuous pursuit of a merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy coupled with technology investments enables the players to devise a solid digital solutions suite. Companies like Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Incorporated MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX are well-placed to gain from the growth prospects of the industry.\nAbout the Industry\nThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors. The players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.\n4 Trends Defining Future of the Financial Transaction Services Industry\nWidespread Uptake of Contactless Payments: One of the most prominent trends noticed since the coronavirus outbreak is people's inclination toward adopting digital means across every sphere of life. With the cost-effective nature and ease of digital payments, there is no sign of the digital trend fading away anytime soon. Several flexible digital payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, cryptocurrency, biometrics, to QR code utilization, which consumers were earlier skeptical of, have started gaining popularity. As a result, the financial transaction services industry players have been actively undertaking significant investments for building an upgraded suite and subsequently, attracting new clients as well as retaining the existing ones. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for the industry participants, digital prowess continues to fetch regular revenues and drives their margins in the long term.\nBetter Consumer Spending: Substantial personal savings made during the pandemic enable continued consumer spending despite looming fears of inflation and recession. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market have positively influenced the purchasing power of consumers. The affinity of people to spend more implies increased utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction service players. This, in turn, boosts transaction volumes that contribute significantly to the revenues of industry participants. According to the 2023 Annual U.S. Economic Outlook issued by one of the digital payments leaders, Visa, consumer spending in the first half of 2023 is expected to remain higher than the 2022 figure and gradually pick up in the latter part of the year.\nImproved Cross-Border Travel: The receding impact of the pandemic led to the easing of border restrictions and renewed confidence in travel. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space that engage in global money transfers. The industry participants having exposure to the cross-border business leave no stone unturned to devise platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments. Amid the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel, these platforms inevitably reap benefits for the players.\nAn Active M&A Strategy: Participants of the financial transaction services space frequently resort to the M&A strategy to upgrade their capabilities in addition to making uninterrupted technology investments. The strategy reflects industry players' focus on bolstering their customer base, entering new markets and establishing a significant share across the global market. The primary aim behind these deals is to bring about diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. The current year is expected to be exciting, with respect to M&A deals, according to PwC's Global M&A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.\nZacks Industry Rank Instills Optimism\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects.

    "excerpt": "Jeremy Hunt is reportedly planning to keep the energy price guarantee at \u00a32,500 from April - Zara Farrar / HM TreasuryHousehold bills should not rise by an average of \u00a3500 a year from April, as\u2026",
    "summary": "Household bills should not rise by an average of \u00a3500 a year from April, as expected, as Jeremy Hunt is poised to extend the energy price guarantee at its current level for another three months.\nThe Government's energy price guarantee is due raise its threshold from \u00a32,500 to \u00a33,000 from April 1, leaving households facing extra payments on their bills despite wholesale gas prices having fallen 40pc since the start of this year.\nHowever, the Chancellor plans to retain the guarantee for another three months until wholesale prices have fallen so far that it becomes unnecessary, according to the Times.\nIt comes as energy companies are reportedly already preparing to amend bills as they expect Mr Hunt to keep the Government's support package at \u00a32,500 a year, according to the BBC.\nConsumer champion Martin Lewis has said there is a \"better than 50pc chance\" that annual energy bills will stay at \u00a32,500 instead of rising to \u00a33,000 a year from April.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I was saying earlier in the week, reading the runes, it was a better than 50pc chance that the price wouldn't go up.\"\nThe Government has previously said the energy price guarantee is under review while a Treasury source declined to \"comment on speculation\".\nCity economists have also started to factor this into their forecasts.\nIt is one of the reasons JP Morgan no longer predicts a recession, while Deutsche Bank has a shallower contraction in the second quarter and Citi thinks inflation could fall below 3pc by the end of 2023.\nRead the latest updates below.\nJeremy Hunt is expected to maintain the government's energy price guarantee at \u00a32,500 a month to avoid households having to pay an extra \u00a3500 a year from April.\nThe Government's cap on what households will pay, which has shielded homes from the worst of the surge in wholesale energy prices, had been due to rise to \u00a33,000 a year from April.\nHowever, the Chancellor will keep the guarantee at \u00a32,500 for another three months, according to the Times.\nNearly 50 offshore workers on several of BP's North Sea installations have backed strike action in pursuit of a pay increase and overtime changes, union Unite has said.\nThe strike involves crew working on BP's Andrew, Clair, Clair Ridge, ETAP, Glen Lyon and Mungo installations in the North Sea, with \"a series of 24 and 48-hour stoppages\".\nBusiness activity rebounded last month to its strongest level since June last year amid falling gas prices, according to a closely watched index.\nOutput from the UK service sector expanded for the first time in six months in February amid a turnaround in client confidence, according to the S&P Global and CIPS UK Services purchasing managers' index.\nIt gave a reading of 53.5 for February, up from 48.7 in January. A figure above 50 indicates expansion and below shows contraction.\nBusinesses were helped by the decline in wholesale gas prices, which left input inflation at its lowest level in 20 months.\nRising export sales contributed to the rebound in total new orders in February, reaching its strongest level since May 2022.\nThere is a \"better than 50pc chance\" that energy bills will stay at \u00a32,500 instead of rising to \u00a33,000 a year from April, consumer champion Martin Lewis has said, amid speculation that Government support will be maintained.\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I was saying earlier in the week, reading the runes, it was a better than 50% chance that the price wouldn't go up.\"\nHe said some energy firms are planning to keep April's rates at current levels, suggesting energy help will continue. He added:\nI'm hearing they have not been told that the rate is staying.\nThey have been told that there is an attempt to keep the rate at \u00a32,500.\nSo we're not at the smoking gun stage that this is definitely happening, but I would say we're at an 85pc likelihood that the price won't be going up.\nIf there's no U-turn, you'll pay 20pc more than you do now. If there is a U-turn, you'll pay exactly the same as you do now.\nOn the face of it, it looks like a no brainer for Jeremy Hunt to keeping the energy price guarantee (EPG) at \u00a32,500 for an extra three months.\nEconomics editor Szu Ping Chan explains why:\nKeeping the EPG at \u00a32,500 past April 1 will provide households across the UK with some much-needed relief.\nIt would also help to bear down on inflation and reduce the headline rate more quickly. After all, prime minister Rishi Sunak has vowed to halve it this year.\nWhat's more, it's cheap. Relatively anyway. Falling energy costs means the Chancellor is expected to spend just \u00a31.9bn capping typical bills this year, rather than the \u00a312.8bn estimated at the time of the Autumn Statement, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS).\nNot letting the cap rise to \u00a33,000 will raise the total cost of the EPG to \u00a34.6bn this year - still representing a saving compared with November.\nSo why is the Treasury still toying with the policy? Put simply, it's because keeping bills down now could stoke inflation later.\nCatherine Mann, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee that sets interest rates, warned just this week that\u00a0a fall in energy costs might prompt consumers to spend more on other things, potentially pushing up inflation in other\u00a0parts of the economy.\nOne of the biggest names in investing in emerging-markets is betting $1.9bn (\u00a31.6bn) on Gautam Adani's struggling empire.\nRajiv Jain's GQG Partners bought shares in four firms from an Adani family trust at discounts to Thursday's closing prices.\nOt is the most significant show of support from a major money manager since a short-seller report wiped $153bn (\u00a3127.6bn) off the Indian conglomerate's market value.\nAll 10 Adani Group stocks climbed in Mumbai on Friday, with their combined market value rising by about $8bn (\u00a36.7bn).\nThat is set to be the biggest increase since short-seller Hindenburg Research's January 24 report which made accusations of accounting fraud and share-price manipulation.\nBP has opened its fastest, most powerful and largest electric-vehicle charging hub in Kettering, Northamptonshire.\nDrivers using the site at the intersection of the A14 and A43 will be able to use one of ten 300kW chargers, capable of adding up to 100 miles of charge in around 15 minutes.\nBP's electric vehicle charging business bp pulse has already built hubs in Park Lane, London, and at Gatwick Airport.\nA site is under construction in the West Midlands, which when completed will contain 16 ultra-fast 300kW chargers capable of charging 32 EVs at any one time.\nIt comes after BP last month dialled back on targets to cut oil and gas production by 40pc by 2030, saying it will now only cut by 25pc.\nThe FTSE 100 opened higher, boosted by mining stocks as metal prices rose on optimism of a recovery in top consumer China, while an overnight rise in US stocks also helped gains.\nThe blue-chip FTSE 100 gained 0.3pc, while the more domestically-focussed FTSE 250 midcap index rose 0.3pc.\nBoth British indexes are on track to rise nearly 1pc for the week.\nIndustrial metal miners took an early lead, rising 1.6pc as metal prices gained after promising economic data from China buoyed demand prospects.\nGlobal markets are tracking overnight gains in US markets, which closed higher on Thursday, taking cues from Atlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic who argued for the central bank to stick with \"steady\" quarter-point rate increases for now.\nOilfield services firm Hunting dropped 10.6pc after Berenberg downgraded the stock to \"hold\" from \"buy\".\nHotel Chocolat has begun a formal redundancy process as it reportedly seeks to take the business in a \"leaner and more competitive direction\".\nStaff were notified that their roles were at risk on February 21 as the UK chocolate business said it was \"operating with a backdrop of calmer growth plans and increasing costs\", according to a letter seen by Grocery Gazette. It said:\nIn line with the shape of our future plan we've taken steps to build more collaboration, cost-efficiency and profitability into our model.\nThe next major step on this journey is organising ourselves for sustainable success in 2023 and beyond.\nThe decision to impact colleagues is not taken lightly. This means we need to make some changes to the way we organise that may involve fewer members of the team.\nOur business plan has evolved to focus on more careful growth, and we will now work through a formal consultation process.\nA Hotel Chocolat spokesman said: \"We recognise this is a difficult time for our team as we consult with them on the proposal, and we are supporting them at this time.\n\"This decision has not been taken lightly. After careful consideration, the changes we are proposing are part of the next phase in our journey towards sustainable success for the years ahead.\"\nEducation group Pearson has seen its share price fall after it warned of a decline in higher education revenues and predicted underlying sales growth of low to mid single digits.\nThe company was boosted last year by virtual learning and the resumption of exams in the UK as profits grew by nearly a fifth.\nIt said demand for English language learning grew 24pc, as overall sales increased 12pc to \u00a33.8bn while its adjusted operating profit was up 18pc to \u00a3456m.\nHowever, a fall in higher education by 4pc was driven by a decline in enrolments and a loss of adoptions to non-mainstream publishers, including open educational resources.\nChief executive Andy Bird said: \"These results are testament to the strong momentum that we've been building operationally and strategically over the past 24 months.\n\"For a second consecutive year, our financial performance was ahead of expectations, and we saw progress in our strategic initiatives, which are taking Pearson on a new, exciting journey.\"\nThe FTSE 100 has rallied after steadier comments from a US Federal Reserve chief about the outlook for interest rates.\nThe blue chip index was up 0.5pc to 7,955.97 while the midcap FTSE 250 rose 0.2pc to 19,899.17 at the open.\nAtlanta Federal Reserve President Raphael Bostic said he favoured \"slow and steady\" quarter-point US rate increases to limit risk to the economy.\nShell's new boss has said cutting oil and gas ouput will be bad for customers, echoing comments from the chief executive of rival producer BP.\nWael Sawan told Time Radio:\nI am of a firm view that the world will need oil and gas for a long time to come.\nAs such, cutting oil and gas production is not healthy.\nWe've seen of course through 2022 the fragility of the energy system.\nTo see prices start to skyrocket, that's not healthy for anyone, particularly consumers.\nThis week, BP chief executive Bernard Looney warned that dutting fossil fuel supplies too quickly risks a fresh surge in energy prices.\nThe British microchip company Arm has confirmed it has rejected ministers' lobbying and will proceed with a bumper US stock market listing.\nTechnology editor James Titcomb has the latest:\nRene Haas, Arm's chief executive, said the decision to float its shares on Wall Street came despite talks with the Government and Financial Conduct Authority (FCA).\nHe confirmed that Arm planned a secondary UK listing at some point in the future and said that the company would continue to be headquartered in Britain.\nConfirmation that Arm will snub London is a blow to the Government, which had lobbied for Arm to return to the British stock market, and adds to growing concerns about the competitiveness of the market.\n\nThe markets watchdog has opened an investigation into the London Metal Exchange's handling of a controversial short squeeze in the nickel market last year.\nThe Financial Conduct Authority said it opened an enforcement investigation into some of the LME's \"conduct and systems and controls\" in the period leading up to the suspension of trades.\nThe LME cancelled about $3.9bn worth of trades on March 8 when futures spiked 250pc in a little over 24 hours.\nThe LME's actions effectively served as a bailout of top nickel producer Tsingshan Holding Group and eased the strain on brokers who were facing huge margin calls.\nBut it also caused huge controversy after hedge funds and other traders had highly profitable contracts torn up.\nThe Bank of England, which separately reviewed the LME's clearing operation, said that the clearing unit will need to strengthen its governance arrangements, increase independence in management and governance.\nThe LME said it will cooperate with the FCA's investigation.\nRightmove chief executive Peter Brooks-Johnson will step down after 17 years in the business in 2023, including six years as its boss.\nHe hailed the company's business model as it navigated the rapid rise in mortgage rates following the mini-Budget, as average revenue per advertiser grew by \u00a3125 - its second-highest performance after the 2021 Covid-recovery year. He said:\nThe year's changing housing market conditions demonstrated our customers' resilience and ability to adapt and to continue to succeed.\nThe softening from the Covid-induced frenetic market towards a more normal market earlier in the year was disrupted in the final few months by the unexpected rapid mortgage rate increases.\nThe strength of our results is a reminder of how effective and integral our new and existing products and services are in helping our customers in both faster and slower markets.\nDevelopers usually selling homes off plan turned to Rightmove to boost sales at the end of last year, as the estate agent revealed rising profits.\nThe online agent said it enjoyed an 8pc increase in the number of developments listed on its website at the end of 2022.\nRightmove brushed off concerns about the outlook for the property market as it revealed operating profit grew 7pc last year to \u00a3241.3m. Revenues were up 9pc to \u00a3332.6m.\nIn its annual results, the company said it will \"remain alert to the ongoing economic uncertainty\" but insisted it is \"not materially impacted by the property market cycle\".\nIt will increase its final dividend for 2022 by 8pc to 5.2p.\nThe HS2 rail project could be delayed among a number of potential options being considered to curb rising costs, the project's boss has said.\nIn an interview with the BBC, HS2 chie",

    "summary": "The Oklahoma Sooners 2024 recruiting class will be the first of Oklahoma's tenure in the SEC. With the Sooners and the Texas Longhorns making the move in 2024, the recruiting classes that the Red River Rivals are building for 2024 'just means more.'\nWhile the 2022 and the 2023 classes will be the foundation of Oklahoma's move to the SEC, the 2024 class will be marked as the Sooners' first recruiting class of the SEC era. And much like last spring, when the Sooners appeared to be struggling on the recruiting trail (to some), Oklahoma looks to be on the verge of seeing the fruits of their labors.\nThat first fruit came in the form of a commitment from four-star cornerback Jeremiah Newcombe out of Arizona. The quick-twitch corner is a playmaker who plays fast on the field and brings an edge to the outside cornerback position.\nWith the Sooners' first commitment in the cycle, where does that put them amongst their future SEC foes?

    "summary": "SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Three white men serving prison sentences in the 2020 killing of Ahmaud Arbery are asking an appeals court to throw out their federal hate crime convictions, with two of them arguing their histories of making racist comments don't prove they targeted Arbery because he was Black.\n'Every crime committed against an African American by a man who has used racist language in the past is not a hate crime,' defense attorney Pete Theodocion said in an appellate brief written on behalf of defendant William 'Roddie' Bryan.\nArbery, 25, was chased by pickup trucks and fatally shot in the streets of a Georgia subdivision outside the port city of Brunswick on Feb. 23, 2020. His killing sparked a national outcry when cellphone video Bryan recorded of the shooting leaked online more than two months later.\nGreg McMichael and his son, Travis McMichael, armed themselves with guns and pursued Arbery after he was spotted running past their home. Bryan joined the chase in his own truck and recorded Travis McMichael shooting Arbery at close range with a shotgun.\nAll three men were sentenced to life in prison after a jury convicted them of murder in a Georgia state court in 2021. The following year, they stood trial again in U.S. District Court and were found guilty of committing federal hate crimes in Arbery's death. That jury was shown roughly two dozen racist text messages and social media posts by the McMichaels and Bryan.\nThey all filed legal briefs in their federal appeals March 3 with the 11th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals in Atlanta. Attorneys for Bryan and Greg McMichael say their hate crime convictions should be overturned because the evidence shows they pursued Arbery thinking he was a criminal, not because of his race.\nGreg McMichael initiated the chase when Arbery ran past his home because he recognized the young Black man from security camera videos that in prior months showed Arbery entering a neighboring home under construction. None of the videos showed him stealing, and Arbery was unarmed and had no stolen property when he was killed.\nArbery's race was 'a fact of no greater import to Gregory McMichael's calculus than Mr. Arbery's biological sex, the shorts he was wearing, his hairstyle, or his tattoos,' wrote Greg McMichael's attorney, A.J. Balbo. He said there would have been no chase had the runner been a Black woman.\nBryan didn't know the McMichaels and had never seen the security camera videos. Still, his attorney said that Bryan 'had every right to assume' Arbery was likely a criminal after seeing him run by with the McMichaels in pursuit and ordering Arbery to stop.\n'Arbery never called out for help or gave any signs that he was the victim of an unprovoked attack,' Theodocion wrote on Bryan's behalf.\nTravis McMichael's appeal makes no effort to challenge whether racism motivated Arbery's killing. Instead, his attorney argues a technicality, saying prosecutors failed to prove that Arbery was chased and killed on public streets \u2014 as stated in the indictment used to charge the three men.\nDefense Attorney Amy Lee Copeland says documents show that Glynn County officials declined to take over responsibility for the streets of Satilla Shores from a private developer when the subdivision was dedicated in 1958. She argued there's no record that the county ever changed its mind.\nDefense attorneys made the same arguments challenging racial motives and whether the streets were public during the federal trial in February 2021.\nProsecutors argued at the trial that the McMichaels and Bryan chased and shot Arbery out of 'pent-up racial anger.'\nBryan had used racist slurs in text messages saying he was upset that his daughter was dating a Black man. A witness testified Greg McMichael had angrily remarked on the 2015 death of civil rights activist Julian Bond: 'All those Blacks are nothing but trouble.' In 2018, Travis McMichael commented on a Facebook video of a Black man playing a prank on a white person: 'I'd kill that f----ing n----r.'\nOn the question of whether the streets were public, prosecutors showed 101 service tickets for work the county performed in the neighborhood, mostly dealing with ditches and drainage. Copeland argued nothing showed the county paving or maintaining the streets except in relation to drainage repairs.\nThe U.S. Justice Department, which prosecuted the hate crimes case, has 30 days to file legal briefs in response to the hate crime appeals. A spokesman for U.S. Attorney Jill Steinberg, the federal prosecutor for Georgia's Southern District, declined to comment Friday. The Justice Department in Washington did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\nThe 11th Circuit has not set a date to hear oral arguments in the hate crime appeals. Both McMichaels received life prison sentences in the federal case, while Bryan was sentenced to 35 years in prison. Also pending are appeals by all three men of their murder convictions in Glynn County Superior Court.",

    "summary": "A monstrous 5,000-mile-wide mass of macroalgae called sargassum is making its way to Florida, but where it ultimately ends up is up still isn't clear.\nSargassum is a genus of brown macroalgae or seaweed that is commonly found throughout the world, but abundantly so in a patch of the Atlantic Ocean called the Sargasso Sea. The massive drift of seaweed isn't new. Christopher Columbus wrote about sargassum during his voyage to North America.\nHowever, in 2011, researchers began to observe explosive growth in the belt, known as the great Sargassum belt, thought to be sparked by excess fertilizer, raw sewage and soil runoff.\n\nThe floating mass, which stretches across the Atlanta Ocean from Africa to Florida, saw even more alarming growth this winter.\n\"This year could be the biggest year yet,\"\u00a0even bigger than previous upticks, said Brian Lapointe, an algae specialist and research professor at Florida Atlantic University's Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institute.\nIt's already beginning to wash up in the Florida Keys and Barbados and elsewhere in the region, but researchers don't know where the bulk of it could wind up.\nThe monstrous seaweed bloom is just one more example of a growing global invasion of macro and microscopic algal blooms thriving on an increasing supply of nutrients such as nitrogen in freshwater and marine ecosystems.\nSargassum is a naturally-occurring type of macroalgae found in the ocean. Berry-like structures found throughout the plant's web of appendages and branches called pneumatocysts are filled with oxygen that enables the plant to float along the surface of the water, allowing it to freely drift with the surrounding currents.\nThese rafts of Sargassum can stretch for miles and serve as a valuable habitat for a range of marine creatures, offering food, shelter and breeding grounds.\nIt also serves as a primary nursery area for a variety of commercially important fish like mahi mahi, jacks and amberjacks, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nAlgal blooms have been linked to human activities, according to a recent\u00a0Nature study about coastal phytoplankton. Things like lawn fertilizers, wastewater and agricultural runoff increasingly send pollutants into rivers, lakes and oceans.\n\"These nutrients are the common thread that ties all the algal blooms together,\" whether it's sargassum, red tide, or blue green algae, Lapointe said.\nHe has linked the surge in sargassum to flow from the Mississippi River, extreme flooding in the Amazon basin, as well as to the mouth of the Congo where upwelling and vertical mixing of the ocean can bring up nutrients that feed the blooms. He said deforestation and burning also may contribute.\n\nSargassum has beached itself along Pensacola shores for a very long time. Its impact depends on how much drifts ashore and the surrounding environment.\nIf you're a beachgoer, you probably won't have much to worry about, though you might not want to get too close. Once the seaweed washes up on the beach, it begins to rot in in the sun, releasing a pretty fowl smell and producing hydrogen sulfide gas, which can cause breathing difficulties in people.\n\"If you have beautiful tourist beaches, you don't don't want to have seaweed decaying on your beaches,\" said Dr. Jane Caffrey, a professor in the UWF's Center for Environmental Diagnostics and Bioremediation.\nAccording to Carrey, Pensacola Beach saw big rafting last year, but it went mostly unnoticed among the public.\nHowever, large portions could be costly when it comes to removal and dangerous to local marine creatures.\nJeffrey Wade, director of UWF's Center for Environmental Diagnostics and Bioremediation, says the rotting seaweed isn't easy to clean up and the county has had to bring out big machinery to clean the beach in the past.\nIn addition to the unsightly piles of sargassum along the coast, some species produce toxins that affect the food chain or deplete the oxygen in the water when they start to decay, causing fish kills and the die off of other marine species.\nBlooms have been at least indirectly linked to climate change in several ways, but especially to the warming temperatures that bring more extreme rainfall that washes silt and pollutants into waterways.\nThe authors of the coastal phytoplankton study, Lapointe and other researchers have found the following:\nA correlation in some regions between changes in sea surface temperatures and ocean circulation.\nWarmer temperatures coincided with blooms in high-latitude regions such as Alaska and the Baltic Sea.\nClimate change can affect ocean circulation and the movement of nutrients that feed phytoplankton blooms.\nGlobal climate events, such as El Nino, also show connections to bloom frequency and movement.\nAlgal bloom-favorable seasons in temperate seas have increased with warmer temperatures.\n\"We can't really say which particular beach at which particular time,\" Barnes said. The university publishes a regular update on the status of the sargassum bloom.\n\"We can get an idea of when it will be fairly close,\" he said. \"In general, everything flows west. It will come across the Central Atlantic and into the Caribbean, and into the Gulf of Mexico through the straits of Florida.\"\nWinds, currents and even small storms can influence where the sargassum moves.\nPuerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands could get hit pretty hard, Barnes said. But the floating mats also wind up on beaches in Jamaica and all around the coast of Florida.\nUSA Today climate, environment reporter Dinah Voyles Pulver contributed to this story.\nThis article originally appeared on Pensacola News Journal: Sargassum seaweed blob headed to Florida.

    "excerpt": "Gov. Josh Shapiro spoke Thursday at the Mercyhurst Municipal Police Academy in North East after meeting with a group of cadets.",
    "summary": "NORTH EAST \u2015 Gov. Josh Shapiro, making his first stop in Erie County since taking office, continued on Thursday to make a pitch for incentives in his first budget proposal that aim to bolster the ranks of police officers, teachers and nurses.\nAfter meeting with cadets at the Mercyhurst Municipal Police Academy, Shapiro said law enforcement faces a \"dire situation.\"\n\"We are short in Pennsylvania right now just over 1,200 municipal police officers,\" he said. \"Think about that. Not just here in Erie, but all across Pennsylvania. We simply do not have enough police officers to fill the vacant spots before we even think about making additions beyond that.\"\n\nThe Pennsylvania State Police Department is in a similar situation, Shapiro said, noting that in the 1990s there were 10,000 cadets enrolled annually in its training program for aspiring troopers. Today, the average is 1,000.\nTo counter the workforce shortages, Shapiro is proposing a three-year income tax credit worth up to $2,500 annually to recruit new police officers, teachers and nurses.\nHe's also proposing an investment of $16.4 million to pay for four additional cadet training classes for the Pennsylvania State Police, which could put as many as 400 new troopers on the highways and in the rural communities that rely on the agency for law enforcement protection.\nShapiro is also asking the General Assembly to establish a separate funding mechanism for State Police, called the Public Safety and Protection Fund, that would shift about $100 million a year for five years from state gas tax revenue to pay for the State Police.\nIf it becomes law, the new tax credit would take effect this year and could be claimed when a person files their 2024 taxes.\nAnyone who receives a certification in those three fields would be eligible, including people who have state-recognized credentials from outside Pennsylvania and move here.\nThe tax credit is anticipated to cost $25 million over three years.\nShapiro's proposed funding for the State Police has long been discussed by state officials. The agency is now funded through state gasoline tax revenue, known formally as the Motor License Fund, which Shapiro said pits the agency against infrastructure funding.\nHe would shift $100 million a year for five years away from the Motor License Fund to fund Pennsylvania State Police until the agency is paid for out of the General Fund, which has an $11 billion surplus.\nThe move, he said, would free up an additional $1.5 billion for roads and bridges while \"ensuring law enforcement have the\u00a0resources\u00a0they need to keep our communities safe. \"\nShapiro's budget would also:\nInvest $105 million into the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime and Delinquency's Violence Intervention and Prevention program.\nInvest $50 million as an initial investment for 911 dispatching as part of efforts to create a \"stable\" funding dispatching services.\nShapiro noted that one in every four dispatching jobs are vacant in Northwestern Pennsylvania, with one in every five such jobs vacant statewide.\n\nAmong those in attendance Thursday was Erie Bureau of Police Chief Daniel Spizarny, who said that since the 1980s police departments from large Southern cities, including Atlanta, Miami and Houston, as well as federal and state agencies, have come to Erie to recruit law enforcement officers.\n\"The Erie area has been exporting many talented students across the country,\" he said. \"But in just the past three years, we've been noticing a marked decrease in the number of candidates available.\"\nThe number of candidates on the list from which the city of Erie hires has dropped from 90 to 73 to 46. Twenty-six agencies pull from that list, he noted.\n\"You can see where the critical need is starting to rise here,\" he said. \"Erie Police Department has a complement of 194 sworn officers. Right now, we're down approximately 15. We're extremely concerned.\"\nBill Hale is program director for the Mercyhurst Municipal Police Academy, which is a full-time, six-month program that meets the minimum requirements of entry-level police officers as set by the Pennsylvania Municipal Police Officer's Education and Training Commission. The academy has been operated by Mercyhurst University in Erie since 1977 and has graduated more than 1,000 cadets.\nHale said class sizes are cyclical. He's seen classes of 35 and 40 cadets to just 10 or 11. Shapiro met Thursday with 14 cadets who are on track to graduate in June. Hale noted that \"political winds\" tend to impact recruitment, but he's starting to see a change.\n\"I can sense it's starting to change,\" (for the better), he said.\n\nShapiro said Thursday there are both financial and non-financial ways to address the shortages.\n\"Another part of this is all of us speaking with one voice and stating very clearly over and over and over again that policing is a noble profession,\" Shapiro said. \"We are asking more and more of our police and we need to make sure that they have more and more of our support while also holding them to a high standard of care in our communities and a high standard of training and excellence.\"\nMatthew Rink can be reached at mrink@timesnews.com or on Twitter at @ETNRink.\nThis article originally appeared on Bucks County Courier Times: Josh Shapiro pitches tax credit to bolster PA police recruitment",

    "excerpt": "Donald Trump held his first major rally of his 2024 presidential campaign in Waco, Texas on Saturday - with possible indictment looming over him.",
    "summary": "WACO, Texas \u2014 Former President Donald Trump vowed to destroy the 'deep state' during a campaign rally in this city Saturday, which is in the midst of the 30th anniversary of the federal siege of anti-government cult leader David Koresh's compound.\n'Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state,' Trump said of the stakes of his bid for a return to the Oval Office.\nAt the first major rally of his campaign, Trump spoke to thousands of boisterous supporters on the tarmac of a regional airport. Before his remarks, his red, white and blue jet circled the crowd before landing and pulling up behind his stage.\nHe referred to the administration of his successor, Joe Biden, as the 'Biden regime,' accused Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg of \"prosecutorial misconduct\" in investigating him and said \"the Supreme Court didn't have the courage to right the wrong\" of his 2020 defeat.\n'When this election is over, I will be the president of the United States,' Trump declared. 'You will be vindicated and proud, and the thugs and criminals who are corrupting our justice system will be defeated, discredited and totally disgraced.'\n\"I am your warrior. I am your justice. And I took a lot of heat for this one, but I only mean it in the proper way \u2014 for those who have been wronged and betrayed \u2026 I am your retribution,\" he added.\nBut Trump also took direct aim at his leading rival for the GOP nomination, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who has not yet announced whether he will run.\nTrump bristled at DeSantis flirting with a run \u2014 even though he helped him win the governorship in 2018. The former president ripped DeSantis for past positions favoring cuts to Medicare and Social Security and said that the Florida governor's narrative of revitalizing the state is deceiving.\n'Florida has been tremendously successful for many years, long before this guy became governor,' Trump said. 'Florida has been successful for decades.'\nAlong with the physical backdrop of this small city on the Brazos River, within a three-hour drive of Dallas, Houston, San Antonio and Austin, Trump is surrounded by the prospect of indictments in Manhattan, Atlanta and Washington, D.C., over questions about the hush money payment to a porn star, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.\nTrump walked on stage with the \"Justice for All\" video playing \u2014a choir of men incarcerated for their role in the Jan. 6 riot singing the national anthem, interposed with Trump reciting the pledge of allegiance. It included images of the insurrection as well.\nTrump has been railing against the government officials investigating him, with increasingly dark warnings about the \"death and destruction\" that could ensue should he be indicted.\nBut much as it's impossible to ignore the obvious spectacle of an anti-establishment candidate stoking thousands of his supporters at the site of a showdown between federal agents and anti-government conspiracy theorists, there are more traditional political reasons why Trump picked Waco as the launch point for a new round of his trademark rallies.\nLieutenant Gov. Dan Patrick said Saturday that he had suggested Waco when Trump called to seek his advice more than two weeks ago.\n'I didn't even know it was the 30th anniversary to be candid with you,' Patrick told a small group of reporters.\nAs he seeks the GOP presidential nomination for the third time in a row, Trump and his team well understand the importance of Texas in delivering delegates to the Republican National Convention. The state is second only to California in the number of delegates available, and it will matter more to the final count than the first four early states \u2014 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2014 combined.\n\"It's guaranteed to be a crowd for him and it's part of I think the success they can have in going to red states,\" said one former Trump campaign aide. \"It is intimidating. It's a show of force. Here's 10, 15,000, whatever, people in a room and nobody else can do that.'\nIt also fits his basic pattern of picking sites that are outside major cities but accessible to them.\n\"President Trump is holding his first campaign rally in Waco in the Super Tuesday state of Texas because it is centrally located and close to all four of Texas' biggest metropolitan areas,\" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said. \"This is the ideal location to have as many supporters from across the state and in neighboring states attend this historic rally\" as can make it.\nTrump's aides dismiss the possibility that holding a Waco rally during the 30th anniversary of the siege might show sympathy to anti-government voters.\n\"That sounds like stuff that people in New York or D.C. who have never even been to Texas would say,\" said one Trump aide.\nIn addition to Patrick, Trump announced his Texas leadership team for the state, which included 12 of the 25 Republican House members from Texas.\nHe was also joined by Reps. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., both of whom warmed up one his larger crowds since he lost the presidency.\nGaetz said from the stage, and later while he posed for photos with the crowd, that DeSantis and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, should endorse Trump.\nBut Gaetz sidestepped a question about whether DeSantis could hurt his future ambitions if he runs against Trump.\n\"I'm a lawmaker,\" he said, \"not a pundit.\"\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

'And I was like, this is not good.'\nWe were able to retrieve some of the documents, ourselves. The papers we saw all have medical information for the same patient at a hospital in Augusta, Georgia.

    "excerpt": "The Eurovision-winning band's five-city swing culminates in their first SXSW appearance on March 16.",
    "summary": "Kalush Orchestra, the Ukrainian act that captured the world's attention last year when it won the Eurovision Song Contest as its country was being torn apart by war, wraps up a second North American tour on March 16 with a performance at SXSW in Austin.\nThe seven-member group's song 'Stefania' won Eurovision in Turin, Italy, with a record-setting 438 points from the public, reflecting the widespread pro-Ukraine sentiment at least year's event three months after Russia launched its unprovoked invasion.\n\n\n\n\n 03/09/2023\nAfter the competition, Kalush Orchestra did an 18-show promotional tour, with performances in Poland, Spain, Italy, Germany, France and at Glastonbury Festival in the U.K., before embarking on a 13-city North American tour. The shows helped raise funds for the Ukrainian armed forces. The group also sold its Eurovision trophy for $900,000, with the proceeds earmarked for the purchase of combat drones for Ukraine's military. (The band raised $1.6 million overall.)\nThe current five-city U.S. jog cements the group as one of the few Eurovision winners to turn a victory at the pan-European competition into global success, following in the footsteps of ABBA, which won with 'Waterloo' in 1974, and M\u00e5neskin, which triumphed with 'Zitti e Buoni'\u00a0in 2021. Billboard talked to the Kalush Orchestra's founder and leader, rapper\u00a0Oleh Psiuk, via Zoom about returning to the U.S., the impact of Eurovision on the band's career and the ongoing war with Russia, which is now in its second year.\nBB: Who came up with the idea for this new tour?\nFirst, we were invited to the big showcase festival SXSW in Austin. We considered it to be a very cool opportunity, so we decided we should show our creativity, our works and of course we decided that then we could visit several cities which we've never been to in the U.S. before. That's how our new tour was born, even though the previous one was just five months ago.\nWhat was that first tour like and what would you like to see this time?\nWe had 18 concerts during the previous tour, and they were daily, so unfortunately, we saw only airports and the venues where we had those concerts. But still, we had a little bit of time to see sunny Los Angeles. L.A. is my favorite because I've always been listening to the music and to the performers from that area. And this time I do hope we'll have more time to see and enjoy your country.\nWhat performers from the West Coast are your favorites?\nI love the performers from the so-called Golden Era. Like N.W.A, Tupac Shakur, Snoop Dogg, Ice Cube and Dr. Dre. I listen to lots of music from the West Coast.\nA Year Later, Ukrainian Musicians Are Navigating Wartime\u00a0Lives 03/09/2023\nLast time you met Arnold Schwarzenegger, and he appeared in your video for \u2018Generous Evening' and spoke in Ukrainian. Are there any plans this time to meet any celebrities or government figures?\nWe don't have any plans now, but honestly speaking we didn't have any plans then as well. We wrote to Arnold that very day when we met and that was a lucky coincidence. So we do hope that this time we'll also have such a day when we write to someone famous and we'll have an opportunity to meet.\nIn the U.S., Eurovision is not that well known, though the Will Ferrell film (Eurovision Song Contest: The Story of Fire Saga) has helped increase awareness. How did American audiences find you on your first tour?\nThe bigger part of our audience was still Ukrainians who are living in the U.S. But there were other people who were coming to our concerts. The people who knew Eurovision, what it is, or people who just saw some announcement or billboard in the city and they decided to see us. They were just curious to get to know who we are, but after the concert, all kinds of people came up to us because they really loved it.\nWhat are the main goals you want to accomplish for both the band and Ukraine?\nFirst, we would like to show our music, for it to be known both in the U.S. and in Europe. Whatever city we visit, we'd like to perform and disseminate Ukrainian culture, for it to be well known anywhere. And, of course, we are raising money using the QR codes and the auctions. Last year, we raised 60 million hryvnia ($1.6 million) and we do hope to raise even more this time.\nWhat does the money you raise support?\nWe send this money to some of the well-known foundations like United24 and the Sergey Prytula Foundation. And we buy armored vests and helmets and other important things for our war servicemen and military.\nHow do you feel when you're out of your country? Does the trauma of the war continue?\nHonestly speaking, it does not affect me. It does not influence me whether I'm in Ukraine or not, because there are lots of relatives and my parents and close friends, my good acquaintances who are now in Ukraine and I would say that I worry for them more than for myself. Because I don't worry about myself that much. Obviously, I carry this burden with me everywhere and this kind of anxiety for them.\nLet's talk about what American audiences can expect on this current tour. Will you play new songs?\nYes. We have prepared a program which includes some of the new songs and some of the ones which have just been issued. For instance, we just issued a very new song which has the title 'Changes.' It's a very cool song with a cool video, which reflects all the changes which we are waiting for.\u00a0\u00a0We have a program which unites something authentic with some new styles.\nWill an album be coming out soon?\nSo far, we plan to release singles. If we speak about the album coming out, it is planned closer to the end of the current year or maybe in the beginning of the next year. So far, we are issuing singles with cool videos in English.\nRussia Blocks SoundCloud Over \u2018False' Content About Its Ukraine\u00a0Invasion 03/09/2023\nIt's been not quite a year since you won Eurovision. How has your life changed, and the career trajectory of the band changed since?\nWe can now play a bigger role. We can have more impact on the bigger and vaster audience. We can disseminate our concert abroad and we can cover a broader audience with that. We can tell more about Ukrainian culture abroad.\nThat must have been an important reason for participating in Eurovision in the first place.\nYes, there were many reasons. Not only this one, but it was so important for us to win at this Eurovision, because victory is so important for Ukraine in every aspect. We made lots of people happy with this victory and we do hope it will go on like this.\nUkraine first won Eurovision in 2004 when Ruslana triumphed with 'Wild Dances.' Where were you that year when she won? What did her victory mean to you and Ukraine?\nI was only 10 years old then, so I don't remember that much. But I do remember that it was a big noise, a big event in Ukraine. It had a huge resonance as an event. It was because Eurovision for Ukraine was always a very important competition.\nWhat is next for the band after the American tour? Will there be any more touring in other countries?\nSure. We would like to get to as many of various festivals as possible to show our music and culture to the maximum. We would like to have as productive a year as the previous one was, to raise as much money and to disseminate information about us, about Ukraine.\nThe Kalush Orchestra's 2023 U.S. tour dates:\nMarch 9 \u2014 Cleveland, OH @ Cleveland Masonic\nMarch 10 \u2014 Orlando, FL @ The Beacham\nMarch 11 \u2014 Detroit, MI @ The Magic Stick\nMarch 12 \u2014 Atlanta, GA @ District Atlanta\nMarch 16 \u2014 Austin, TX @ SXSW\nBest of Billboard",

    "excerpt": "With Congress giving states $350 billion for highway spending, it's a critical turning point for the future of American transport.",
    "summary": "The federal government is providing states with $350 billion to spend on highways to alleviate traffic congestion.\nThe US has some of the widest highways in the world, but some states are planning on expanding them.\nBut economists have been saying the same thing since the 1960s: more roads often just leads to more traffic.\nSome of the widest highways in the US have more than 20 lanes \u2014 and traffic is still getting worse.\nLast year, the federal government enacted an infrastructure law, providing states with $350 billion for highways. Even though more lanes often just means more traffic, a number of states, including New York, Texas, Oregon, and Maryland, are considering highway widening projects to ease congestion.\nBut new highways will hurt the communities they cut through and the climate in general.\nHere are some of the widest highways in America \u2014 and why widening them won't solve the problem.\nSince the 1960s, highways helped define America. In 2018, there were over a million miles of highway across the country, costing the federal government $105 billion annually.\nSource: The Guardian\nAt times, highways that have been built have specifically harmed minority communities. For instance, in 1967 in Nashville, officials added a bend to Interstate 40 to ensure the highway went through a predominantly Black neighborhood rather than a white one.\nSource: Los Angeles Times\nMore recently, protestors have fought a $9 billion expansion of the I-35 in Austin, claiming it is discriminatory.\nSource: Texas Standard\nSince the 1960s, new highways have forced out about 1 million people from their homes. The majority of these residents have been Black.\nSource: The Guardian\nAnd highways are hard to ignore. In Los Angeles, one section of the I-405 is 14 lanes wide.\nSource: PolitiFact\nIn Atlanta, there are sections of the I-75 that are 15 lanes wide.\nSource: PolitiFact\nAnd then there's the I-10, also known as the Katy Freeway, in Houston. At certain points, the I-10 is 26 lanes wide.\nSource: New York Times\nIn 2008, the Katy Freeway was extended at a cost of around $2.8 billion. But instead of helping with congestion, traffic actually increased substantially from 2011 to 2014 as more vehicles used the additional lanes.\nSources: Bloomberg, The Guardian\nAs early as the 1960s, economists were saying more roads only meant more cars \u2014 widening highways doesn't work. It's the theory of \"induced demand,\" which basically means congestion rises to meet new capacity.\nSources: New York Times, The Guardian\nBut new highways kept getting built. Between 1993 and 2017, roads increased by 42% in the country's largest 100 cities, while population growth was only 32%. Traffic delays still rose by 144%.\nSource: Curbed\nBut sometimes states don't have a choice. For instance, in Texas, the state constitution requires funding to be used on highways before other forms of transport.\nSources: Bloomberg, The Guardian\nRight now, America could be at a crossroads. Last year, the federal government enacted an infrastructure law to provide states with $350 billion to be used for highways.\nSource: New York Times\nSome environmental organizations were dismayed by the law. This was because, of the $1.3 trillion put aside for transport, only 20% was for transit while 80% went to highways.\nBut President Biden's administration showed a gentle indication for its preferred spending.\nStephanie Pollack, deputy administrator of the Federal Highway Administration, sent a memo to her staff telling them to encourage governments to first look at fixing current roads before laying new ones.\nSource: Wired\nEven so, some states including Oregon, Maryland, Texas, and New York are pushing forward with the status quo. They're looking to re-widen highways, including the Brooklyn Queens Expressway.\nSource: New York Times\nAnd the I-270 and I-495 in Maryland, which will cost around $11 billion.\nSources: New York Times, Washington Post\nWider highways mean more vehicles and more pollution. Across the US, transportation is already responsible for 27% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.\nFor comparison, the agricultural industry is responsible for 11% of the country's greenhouse gas emissions.\nSource: EPA\nSome states and cities are looking at alternatives. In Los Angeles, an expansion to Interstate 710 was abandoned in 2022 after the chief planning officer noted the city didn't see 'widening as a strategy' for the city.\nConsidering Los Angeles is known for its congested highways, this was a big deal.\nThe decision was made after another recently completed project in Los Angeles only temporarily eased traffic before it increased again.\nSource: New York Times\nIn Portland, young climate activists have been fighting against a $1.2 billion plan to widen the I-5 in a section which runs through a neighbourhood called Albina, a historically Black neighborhood.\nIts air quality is already so bad local scientists have recommended that local school children don't play outside.\nSource: Bloomberg\nSo, what's the answer? Matt Turner, an economics professor at Brown University, noted if you want more cars on the road, add more lanes. But that's not what most people want.\nSources: The Guardian, New York Times\nOn the contrary, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said: \"Connecting people more efficiently and affordably to where they need to go is a lot more complicated than just always having more concrete and asphalt out there.\"\nButtigieg has publicly backed prioritizing fixing existing highways over building new ones.\nSources: New York Times, Bloomberg\nLos Angeles is looking into potentially using railways to transport freight to lower the burden on highways.\nSource: New York Times\nWhile in Colorado adopted a new transport regulation in 2021 that directs transport planners toward projects designed to lower pollution, like cycle lanes and more bus routes.\nMass transport is part of the answer \u2014 and it works, too. When Seattle focused on buses and light rail from 2010 to 2017, the increased use of public transport meant traffic decreased, even as the city grew by more than 100,000 people.\nSource: Curbed\nBut despite the advantages, it also comes down to money, Ben Holland, an urban design and land use expert at clean energy non-profit RMI, told The Guardian. Right now, most roads are toll-free and are government subsidized.\nSource: The Guardian\nWhile there's no easy answer, states and the federal government need to think creatively about how roads and public transport are paid for. One option is a congestion charge \u2014 charging people for traveling at peak times.\nThe charge would aim at prompting people to travel at different times and only those who needed to travel at peak times would pay the fee meaning traffic would be eased and wider motorways wouldn't be necessary.\nIt's worked in London and in Stockholm.\nSource: The Conversation\nOther options include more express bus lanes, cycle lanes, walking bridges, and light rail. Basically, people need affordable options to get them out of cars and off the roads.\nSource: New York Times\n\"This is a make-or-break moment,\" Holland told The Guardian. \"How the states use those highway funds will basically determine whether we meet our transportation emissions goals.\"\nSource: The Guardian\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "excerpt": "Tommy Rees isn't all of a sudden any less of an \"ND Guy\" writes @alwaysirishinc",
    "summary": "As you've heard and read from me many times before, Notre Dame is never boring. It's always the next something. And here we are again. In what is normally a rather slow part of the calendar in terms of news and action, the big news has dropped out of South Bend. Now offensive coordinator Tommy Rees will be leaving Notre Dame for the same role at Alabama.\nReactions to this news from the fan base on social media and my morning call call-in show were what one would expect. Mixed. Many feel that this next season is one where Notre Dame would have more offensive talent and that Rees could finally ramp the offense up significantly. Others have felt that it is time for Freeman to have a clean slate to build the program free from all things Kelly era- ish, including Rees.\nIn terms of this from the other side of the table, this move makes plenty of sense for Tommy, and here's why.\nShadow Of The Dome\niSep 15, 2018; South Bend, IN, USA; A general view of the Golden Dome on the campus of the University of Notre Dame before the game between the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and the Vanderbilt Commodores at Notre Dame Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Matt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports\nRees has been inextricably linked to Notre Dame since he was 17 years old as a recruit. Then as a player. Then as a coach. Most of his young life has been centered around being a part of the Irish family. In many ways, this is what Notre Dame is about. These 'lifer legends' that give all of their prime years to Notre Dame.\nBut with this comes a unique kind of pressure. Unique kind of microscope. Maybe a part of him is simply ready for something new. A clean slate. New environment. Fresh scene. Nobody bats an eye when a run-of-the-mill 9-5 working office professional feels this way, maybe this is similar? I couldn't blame him if he felt this way after all these years.\nNick Saban\nDerick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\nNotre Dame fans generally aren't too fond of the Saban Alabama dynasty which is quite understandable as their success has come at our expense in painful fashion on more than one recent occasion. But objectively speaking, if Rees wanted to branch out away from Notre Dame, why not go learn from the most accomplished modern era coach himself? Makes a ton of sense to me.\nWhether Tommy has NFL College Head Coaching goals, it cannot be understated what a successful tenure under Nick Saban can do for one's job prospects. This is the biggest of opportunities.\nAlabama Talent\nJan 8, 2018; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide wide receiver DeVonta Smith (6) celebrates his game-winning touchdown in overtime against the Georgia Bulldogs in the 2018 CFP national championship college football game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nIf you are reading this right now I don't need to remind you just how loaded the Alabama roster is with talent year after year. They are a 5-star factory pumping out top NFL talent on a yearly basis. This no doubt appeals to Rees greatly, as it should.\nShould Rees-led Tide offenses light up the scoreboard, he would have the satisfaction of proving to all of the Notre Dame fans and media that have questioned him along the way (including me), that he is indeed terrific at his job but needed upper-echelon talent for it to truly show.\nTitle Hunt Every Year\nOct 8, 2022; Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide wide receiver Tyler Harrell (8) celebrates after defeating the Texas A&M Aggies at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Butch Dill-USA TODAY Sports\nAlabama is a legitimate National Title contender every year. Notre Dame is not. It's very easy for me to see the appeal in this for Rees. He no longer has to worry about the Irish rebuilding the roster and the new talented recruits to develop. At Alabama, there are reloads not rebuilds.\nWith this fact does come more pressure and expectation, but it appears both Rees himself and Saban both agree he's more than up for the challenge. I know I will be supremely intrigued the first time Rees vs Kelly in an SEC game appears on my television. Things change fast, don't they?\nAlways An ND Guy\nMay 1, 2021; Notre Dame, Indiana, USA; Notre Dame Fighting Irish offensive coordinator Tommy Rees and quarterback Drew Pyne (10) leave the field after the Blue-Gold Game at Notre Dame Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Matt Cashore-USA TODAY Sports\nRees has given so much of his early life to Notre Dame wholeheartedly. He isn't a traitor or a turncoat. This dynamic is simply the nature of the business of coaching which applies even to 'Notre Dame guys'.\nThis could end up being the best possible scenario for all parties involved. Freeman can have more autonomy of the program by shedding more Kelly-era remnants and Rees can spread his wings beyond the dome. Perhaps everybody can win in this when all is said and done?\nFor more Irish news & notes follow John on Twitter\u00a0@alwaysirishINC,\u00a0Always Irish on Youtube\u00a0and or your preferred audio podcast provider.\nStory originally appeared on Fighting Irish Wire",

    "excerpt": "A classically-trained painter and long-time tattoo artist, Kimberly Reed recently opened up her own tattoo studio in the Starland District.",
    "summary": "'It does something for your soul to be in your own comfort zone and be happy. I glow a lot more since I opened this studio,\" said Kimberly Reed of Kimberly Reed Tattoos.\nA classically-trained painter and long-time tattoo artist, Reed, was curious about owning her own tattoo shop but wasn't actively seeking it. Until the opportunity found her.\nWhen a spot came available at Starland's Sola Salons in late November, members quickly reached out to see if she wanted it. With such an opportunity, Reed knew she had to take it. By mid-December, Kimberly Reed Tattoos was officially open for business.\n'I'm glad I've made it this long and far,' reflected Reed. 'In March, I'll be 64, and yes I'm excited for my birthday. It's a mile marker of how much I've come through, how all of this is just a long time coming.'\nAuthenticity for all: Savannah's first fully queer-owned, operated tattoo shop fosters community\nArt off the Air: Yes, Kanye West gave 'not just a tattoo artist' and Savannah creative force Jimmy Butcher a call\n\nA fortuitous set of events brought Reed to Savannah 16 years ago. She was representing her art at a tattoo convention in Boston when Ricky McGee of Anonymous Tattoo saw her work. He liked it and invited her to visit his shop on Bay Street. As luck would have it, she was already planning a trip to Savannah to see her nephew at SCAD.\nReed dropped by McGee's place, and a couple months later, moved to Savannah to begin working there.\nWorking at Anonymous Tatoo wasn't her first rodeo. Or even her fourth, fifth or tenth. Reed came up in the tattoo industry in New York City during the early 1990s when there were few training opportunities and even fewer women in the business.\n'This is the future' How three Savannah artist harness the power of A.I. for creativity\n'I taught myself, which is something you don't ever want to do, but I did it out of necessity,' emphasized Reed. 'I'd been working, trying to work, as a painter for several years by that point, and some friends encouraged me to learn tattooing so I could transform my paintings into body artwork and actually make money. I became a tattoo artist because I had to. I am an artist. And I had to eat.'\nAnd so, the painter with a fine arts degree from Ole Miss, set her jaw and steeled herself to becoming a tattoo-er. One friend set her up with a homemade inking machine; another helped connect her with more tattoo artists. When she felt she was still lacking critical hands-on experience, she reached out to a shop where the owner seemed interested in offering her an apprenticeship. He wanted to meet her.\n'I went to the Bronx one day to this place that had bulletproof glass on the store front,' recalled Reed. 'But then on the inside, it was rooms of floor to ceiling bulletproof glass. The guy's office was behind bulletproof glass. He was nice, but took one look at me, and we both agreed this was not the place for me.'\nNevertheless, Reed persisted. By 1995, she was steadily gaining work and building her portfolio. For more than 10 years she continued honing her techniques at shops in New Jersey, Atlanta and Boston before that star-crossed landing at Anonymous in Savannah.\nOnce in the Hostess City, Reed flourished. At different times she worked at Stranded Tattoo, Good Fortune and The Butcher where she enjoyed the artists, clientele and the very busy lifestyle of being a successful, fulltime tattoo-er.\n\nA Kimberly Reed tattoo is invariably one of deep color and often nature-inspired. Birds, trees, flowers and mandalas resplendent in shimmering blends of pastels are her hallmarks. Cohesive in style, they are wearable artworks, bold yet delicate and yearning to be touched. But it's her attention to detail and perspective that make it clear her designs comes from years of refinement as a fine arts painter.\nIn her new studio at Sola Salons in Starland, she's amidst a crew of some of the city's most revered stylists, aestheticians, barbers and tattoo artists. Reed describes her space as 'very light, airy and inviting like a little nest that's peaceful and comfortable.' There, she is available Tuesday through Saturday by appointment only.\n'I've worked for years figuring it all, figuring out the process and business of tattoos, and I am incredibly grateful to be here working,' intoned Reed. 'It is wonderful to be creating at a time where how I approach tattoo art resonates with people. I feel deeply honored when clients choose me to create art that will adorn their bodies for the rest of their lives. That is a very humbling and uplifting thought, a gift.'\nTo learn more about \u2014 or find inspiration to get one of your own \u2014 check out Kimberly Reed Tattoos at kimberlyreedtattoos.com.\nThis article originally appeared on Savannah Morning News: Kimberly Reed Tattoos in Savannah GA provides designs in Starland",

    "clean_url": "yahoo.com",
    "excerpt": "L.A., San Francisco and other cities need massive private development to supply homes and reduce homelessness. That's why reforms like SB 9 fail.",
    "summary": "The median Los Angeles home sold for $849,000 last year, according to the National Assn. of Realtors. Meanwhile, one of California's signature zoning reforms of the past few years, Senate Bill 9, appears to be having at best a desultory effect on new housing supply, the shortage of which is driving prices upward.\nLos Angeles and other California metropolises need abundant housing to become affordable, and they can get it only by empowering private developers to build significant projects. The fundamental flaw of SB 9 is that it allows individual homeowners to add one or two units at most to their properties, and that is no way to build enough housing to increase affordability.\nIf California actually wants housing to be inexpensively produced, it must enable large-scale production of housing by private firms that have strong incentives to cut costs. Whether politicians like it or not, housing production is indeed governed by the laws of supply and demand.\nLos Angeles is one of the most productive and inherently pleasant parts of the United States, which ensures that demand to live here remains robust. Accordingly, in the 1950s and '60s, Los Angeles' housing stock grew at a healthy rate of 2.2% a year, adding more than 375,000 units over two decades.\nPrices remained affordable as a result. In 1970, the median owner-occupied home in Los Angeles was valued at $26,700 \u2014 $205,900 in 2023 dollars \u2014 and the median monthly rent was $107 \u2014 $825 today. Since 1970, the housing supply growth rate has dropped by two-thirds to 0.7% a year, and prices have soared as demand collided with an increasingly fixed supply.\nHow do we know that the basic economic principle that restricted supply means higher prices applies to housing? Across American cities, the places that build a lot, like Atlanta and Houston, are not expensive, and the places that are expensive, like Boston and Los Angeles, don't build a lot. The rate of home building is lower and prices are higher in metropolitan areas where building is more regulated, according to a survey by Wharton researchers. Studies have found that zoning restrictions have increased neighborhood housing prices by 29% to 38% in Chicago, 17% to 38% in San Francisco, and 32% to 46% across the United States.\nLos Angeles' sky-high housing prices and limited supply growth now pose an extreme burden on all but the richest urbanites. According to some estimates, L.A. is the second-least affordable housing market in the country. An average salary earner in Los Angeles needs to spend 83% of their income on mortgage and taxes to afford an average home. Los Angeles' large homeless population partly reflects high housing costs.\nL.A.'s gentrification fights, such as the battle over Boyle Heights, also reflect the shortage. Wealthier people move into lower-income areas in search of cheaper homes, pushing people out of those communities. The cascade effect is visible throughout the city.\nThat's why more housing in richer neighborhoods would reduce Los Angeles' economic inequities. Tracking anonymous data on 20 million Americans from childhood to their mid-30s, Harvard University scholar Raj Chetty and his collaborators found that where people grow up can have a significant impact on their economic outcomes.\nIn collaboration with the U.S. Census Bureau, Chetty and his team launched the Opportunity Atlas, which shows that a child who grew up in a low-income household in Los Angeles' affluent Brentwood neighborhood earns on average nearly four times more at age 35 than someone who grew up in lower-income central L.A. More homes in affluent areas would give more children a better chance to succeed.\nBuilding more housing in Los Angeles is also good for the environment. Research conducted with USC environmental economist Matt Kahn found that Los Angeles was the fifth-greenest large metropolitan area in the country as measured by carbon emitted by a standardized household, which is almost entirely a function of the relatively mild weather. If Los Angeles built more housing, there would be less building in areas such as Atlanta or Houston that have higher greenhouse gas emissions.\nSB 9, enacted a year ago, created a process for splitting lots and putting up to four homes on an existing parcel, promising to make building easier in California. But we feared that small-scale building \u2014 which could be hindered by local governments \u2014 would do little.\nA year into the program, our fears have only grown. A survey by UC Berkeley researchers of 13 cities, including Los Angeles, found that as of November, a total of 53 new units had been permitted under the law. Fewer than 1 in 5 applications in Los Angeles had been approved.\nCalifornia needs hundreds of thousands of new homes, and that requires building on a different scale. A major housing deficit can be solved only by large-scale production, and that almost inevitably means big private developers. When William Levitt built tens of thousands of homes for veterans after World War II, he figured out how to make housing production as efficient as Henry Ford's assembly line. No homeowner adding an 'accessory dwelling unit' could be remotely as cost-effective.\nThe division of labor was central to the cost-saving assembly lines of Ford and Levitt because each worker focused on one task. But specialization requires scale, and homes today are produced mostly by tiny firms. California has 5,247 companies with fewer than five employees building single-family housing, and only 10 companies with more than 500 employees in the same business.\nImportant new research by the University of Chicago's Yueran Ma and her co-authors shows that over the past century, almost all industries have become increasingly dominated by a small number of large, productive firms. These firms invest more in research and development, growing bigger by developing new technologies. Construction, with its preponderance of tiny firms, is a clear outlier.\nThe small scale of home building helps explain what economists Austan Goolsbee and Chad Syverson call 'the strange and awful path of productivity in the U.S. construction sector.' Their data show that construction value added per worker has been declining since the 1960s.\nThe timing of the drop in productivity reflects zoning changes that shut out large companies. Land-use regulations really began to limit large-scale housing production in the 1960s, making the sector less conducive to bigger companies. Small-scale housing projects don't enjoy scale economies, and small housing producers don't have the resources to invest in the research and development that can lower costs.\nThe fact that California's housing regulations ensure small-scale housing production is ironic, because the state's iconic industries rely on global markets. What sort of movies would Hollywood have created if it had to get a separate permit for every new movie for every theater?\nSo how can California promote the large-scale development it needs to become affordable?\nSince 1969, California has required cities to produce zoning plans that can accommodate regional housing needs. A year ago, the Los Angeles Times reported that the state found L.A. had to add more than 250,000 homes to its zoning plan by last October. L.A. did comply by June, but the city is still obligated to zone for another quarter-million homes by 2024. The cost of noncompliance is pretty small: losing access to state affordable housing funds. Most of the NIMBYs who oppose housing development would be happy to lose those funds.\nA far sharper penalty is available: the so-called 'builder's remedy' included in California's 1982 Housing Accountability Act. The idea is to allow developers to bypass zoning codes and land-use plans as long as more than a fifth of the units of a project are affordable to lower-income households. In practice, however, the remedy's strength remains unclear. Communities will continue to find ways to deter new construction, as they have under SB 9. Judges will stop new projects because they incorrectly believe that building in Southern California is bad rather than good for the environment.\nTo solve its affordability problem, California ultimately has to be willing to overrule reflexive local obstruction of large-scale development. Nothing less will motivate Los Angeles and other cities to permit the housing they sorely need.\nEdward Glaeser is a professor of economics at Harvard University and the author, with David Cutler, of \"Survival of the City.\" Atta Tarki is the founder of ECA Partners and the author of 'Evidence-Based Recruiting.'\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.",

    "summary": "Sometimes things go a little under the radar and that's exactly what happened with the last 2023 team composite rankings from 247Sports. The popular recruiting service updated its final rankings for every player in the recruiting cycle. And with it, an Ohio State recruiting class that was somewhat light on numbers and not as highly thought of got a bit of a bump.\nIt wasn't a major bump, and there's still not the volume of players a lot of other schools have, or probably not even what the Buckeyes would like to have, but it is a bump nonetheless.\nIt's a little like splitting hairs for a class that was already a top ten one, but it's noteworthy to realize that maybe the crop of players that the Ohio State staff identified is one that is better than expected and that the evaluation OSU went through was a good one.\nHere's where Ohio State lands in the final top ten 247Sports Team Composite Rankings once all the final updating to the 2023 player profiles have been completed.\nOregon Ducks\nAn 'End racism' sticker joins the American Flag on the helmets of Oregon players Saturday Oct. 30, 2021.

Other income for the fourth quarter also decreased approximately $2.5 million due to the payoff of notes receivable due from the purchaser of the Company's New Jersey Portfolio in March of 2022. This increase in interest expense and decrease in other income were partially offset by additional property operating income as a result of successful leasing, rental rate roll ups and asset recycling activity over the last twelve months.\nNet loss applicable to Piedmont for the fourth quarter of 2021 did not include any gain on sale of real estate assets or severance costs, but did include a $41.0 million impairment loss on an asset subsequently sold during 2022.\nCore FFO, which removes the impact of the gains on sale of real estate assets, impairment losses, and severance costs enumerated above, as well as depreciation and amortization expense, was $0.50 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2022 as compared to $0.51 per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2021, with the $.01 per diluted share decrease primarily attributable to the $6.8 million, or $.06 per diluted share, increase in interest expense during the fourth quarter of 2022 noted above.\nLeasing:\n\nThree Months Ended December 31, 2022\n\nYear Ended December 31, 2022\n# of transactions\n42\n\n\n203\n\nTotal leasing sf\n433,000\n\n\n2,153,000\n\nNew tenant leasing sf\n164,000\n\n\n763,000\n\nCash rent roll up\n6.5\n%\n\n9.7\n%\nAccrual rent roll up\n11.5\n%\n\n17.2\n%\nLeased Percentage as of period end\n86.7\n%\n\n\nThe Company completed approximately 2.2 million square feet of leasing transactions during 2022, including the largest amount of annual new tenant leasing since 2018.\nThe largest new tenant lease completed during the fourth quarter was an approximately 28,000 square foot lease with Cadence Bank through 2035 at 999 Peachtree Street in Atlanta, GA.\nThe largest renewal and expansion lease completed during the fourth quarter totaled approximately 58,000 square feet with Institute for Justice through 2037 at Arlington Gateway in Arlington, VA.\nThe Company's scheduled lease expirations for 2023 are low, representing approximately 7% of its annualized lease revenue.\nAs of December\u00a031, 2022, the Company had approximately 1.14\u00a0million square feet of executed leases for vacant space yet to commence or under rental abatement, representing approximately $33\u00a0million of future additional annual cash revenue.\nThe Company's leased percentage as of December 31, 2022 was 86.7%, up from 85.5% at December 31, 2021, and down 0.1% for the fourth quarter of 2022 due to the disposition of the 94% leased Cambridge, MA assets during the quarter.\nCapital Markets:\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company completed the sale of its two, 94% leased, Cambridge, MA properties, One Brattle Square and 1414 Massachusetts, resulting in a $102.6 million gain on sale of real estate assets that is included in the Company's results of operations. The combined approximately $160 million in sales proceeds from the two transactions was used to pay off the outstanding balance on the Company's $600 million line of credit, leaving the full capacity of the line available as of December 31, 2022.\nBalance Sheet (including description of a subsequent event):\n\nDecember 31, 2022\n\nDecember 31, 2021\nTotal Real Estate Assets (in millions)\n$\n3,501\n\n\n$\n3,245\n\nTotal Assets (in millions)\n$\n4,086\n\n\n$\n3,931\n\nTotal Debt (in millions)\n$\n1,984\n\n\n$\n1,878\n\nWeighted Average Cost of Debt\n\n3.89\n%\n\n\n2.93\n%\nDebt-to-Gross Assets Ratio\n\n37.6\n%\n\n\n37.1\n%\nAverage Net Debt-to-Core EBITDA (ttm)\n\n6.0x\n\n\n\n5.7x\n\nDuring the fourth quarter, the Company addressed its largest near-term debt maturity by amending its $200 million unsecured term loan facility to extend the final maturity date to June 2025. All other terms of the facility remain unchanged.\nAs previously announced, on January 31, 2023, the Company also entered into an additional new $215 million term loan facility priced at adjusted SOFR + 105 bps with a final extended maturity date of January 31, 2025. The Company intends to use the proceeds from the facility, along with a combination of cash on hand, proceeds from select property dispositions, and/or draws on its $600 million line of credit to repay its $350 million in Unsecured Senior Notes that mature June 1, 2023.\nESG and Operations:\nDuring the fourth quarter, Piedmont received its inaugural GRESB\u00ae assessment, achieving an overall 4 star designation and 'Green Star' recognition. The Company's annual ESG Report which includes Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) metrics and information that aligns with the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) framework is available on the Company's website at www.piedmontreit.com/ESG.\nCommenting on annual and fourth quarter results, Brent Smith, Piedmont's President and Chief Executive Officer, said, \"Despite facing the challenging operating and economic environment that unfolded during 2022, we were able to accomplish a number of key objectives for the year, including the execution of approximately 2.2 million square feet of leasing at meaningfully higher rental rates and the completion of a strategic Midtown Atlanta acquisition paired with several non-core dispositions that furthered our concentration in the Sunbelt to over two-thirds of our annualized lease revenue. We also strengthened our cash position, increasing liquidity ahead of our 2023 debt maturity and bolstering our balance sheet. The fourth quarter also reflects a continuation of these same annual themes: the completion of approximately 433,000 square feet of total leasing, 164,000 square feet of which related to new tenant leases; the completion of the disposition of our Cambridge, MA assets, resulting in the recognition of a nine-digit gain; and the extension of our most near-term debt maturity. Looking ahead, we are encouraged by the approximately 230,000 square feet of leasing already executed thus far in 2023, with over 100,000 square feet of that for new tenant space, demonstrating that leasing velocity has not wavered compared to last year.\"\nFirst Quarter 2023 Dividend\nAs previously announced, on February 1, 2023, the board of directors of Piedmont declared a dividend for the first quarter of 2023 in the amount of $0.21 per share on its common stock to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 24, 2023, payable on March 17, 2023.\nGuidance for 2023\nDue to higher projected interest costs, the Company is introducing the following guidance for the year ending December 31, 2023:\n\n\n\n\n(in millions, except per share data)\nLow\n\nHigh\n\n\nNet income/(loss)\n$\n(1\n)\n\n$\n1\n\n\nAdd:\n\n\n\n\n\nDepreciation\n\n144\n\n\n\n151\n\n\nAmortization\n\n80\n\n\n\n84\n\n\nCore FFO applicable to common stock\n$\n223\n\n\n$\n236\n\n\nCore FFO applicable to common stock per diluted share\n$\n1.80\n\n\n$\n1.90\n\n\nThe Company anticipates continued growth in its Property NOI and SSNOI during the forthcoming year ending December 31, 2023.\nExecuted leasing activity for 2023 is estimated to be in the range of 1.6 to 2.0 million square feet with year-end leased percentage anticipated to be between 87-88%, before the impacts of acquisition and disposition activity.\nThis guidance is based on information available to management as of the date of this release and reflects management's view of current market conditions, including the following specific assumptions and projections:\nThe largest impact on 2023 guidance is increased interest expense. With an over 400 bps increase in the Federal Funds Rate rates during 2022 and further increases projected during 2023, along with two new floating rate term loans priced at adjusted SOFR plus 100 and 105 bps, respectively, replacing $350 million of 10-year bonds maturing in June at an effective rate of 3.43%, projected interest expense for 2023 is estimated to increase approximately $27 million over 2022 total interest expense.\n2023 guidance includes General and Administrative expenses of approximately $29 million.\nNo speculative acquisitions or dispositions are included in the above guidance. The Company will adjust guidance throughout the year as such transactions occur.\nNote that actual results could differ materially from these estimates and individual quarters may fluctuate on both a cash basis and an accrual basis due to the timing of any future dispositions, significant lease commencements and expirations, abatement periods, repairs and maintenance expenses, capital expenditures, capital markets activities, seasonal general and administrative expenses, accrued potential performance-based compensation expense, one-time revenue or expense events, and other factors discussed under \"Forward Looking Statements\" below.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nTo supplement the presentation of the Company's financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"), this release and the accompanying quarterly supplemental information as of and for the period ended December\u00a031, 2022 contain certain financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with GAAP, including FFO, Core FFO, AFFO, Same Store NOI (cash and accrual basis), Property NOI (cash and accrual basis), EBITDAre, and Core EBITDA. Definitions and reconciliations of each of these non-GAAP measures to their most comparable GAAP metrics are included below and in the accompanying quarterly supplemental information.\nEach of the non-GAAP measures included in this release and the accompanying quarterly supplemental financial information has limitations as an analytical tool and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for an analysis of the Company's results calculated in accordance with GAAP. In addition, because not all companies use identical calculations, the Company's presentation of non-GAAP measures in this release and the accompanying quarterly supplemental information may not be comparable to similarly titled measures disclosed by other companies, including other REITs. The Company may also change the calculation of any of the non-GAAP measures included in this news release and the accompanying supplemental financial information from time to time in light of its then existing operations.\nConference Call Information\nPiedmont has scheduled a conference call and an audio web cast for Thursday, February 9, 2023 at 9:00 A.M.

    "excerpt": "Fort Worth is the 13th-largest city in the U.S. but ranks 40th in how entrepreneurs in early-stage startups are able to raise venture capital. And that's a problem, experts say.",
    "summary": "When Farukh Aslam bought the Sinclair Building in downtown Fort Worth about 10 years ago, he knew right away he wanted to transform the historic office building into a hotel. The Pakistani American immigrant fell in love with Fort Worth in the 1990s and spent two decades investing in commercial real estate.\nAslam wanted to explore sustainable options for lighting in the hotel. He decided to use low-voltage, direct-current power commonly used in cars, household appliances and electronics.\nThe Sinclair Hotel was born, and the results were impressive. The building saw 30% savings in power consumption. The technology also allows it to store energy within the building, replacing a traditional diesel backup generator.\nThe experience prompted Aslam to establish his own startup company, Sinclair Digital, in 2020. He and his team knew they needed funding, so they began looking for investors in Fort Worth. Over six to nine months, Sinclair Digital presented its work to 10 to 15 potential funders.\nNobody bit, Aslam said.\n'That's been the number one challenge,' Aslam said. 'Venture capital firms focusing on tech do not look at Fort Worth, or I guess don't take a startup in Fort Worth very seriously. That's been a challenge.'\nVenture capital is a type of early-stage financing that investors give startups and small businesses that they think have opportunity for long-term growth. It can be very risky, and deals tend to revolve around emerging companies looking for significant funds for the first time.\nThe challenge Aslam faced is not isolated to his startup. Entrepreneurship and innovation experts across Fort Worth and the larger North Texas region agree: Fort Worth faces a lack of venture capital funds, and it's a missed opportunity for the city's growth.\nCameron Cushman is the assistant vice president of innovation ecosystems at the University of North Texas Health Science Center. He said Fort Worth is significantly lagging behind in early-stage investing in comparison to other cities.\nDespite being the 13th largest city in the U.S., Fort Worth ranks 40th nationwide in early-stage funding raised, according to data from UNT HSC's innovation ecosystem dashboard Sparkyard. The estimate for early-stage capital raised in Fort Worth from 2015 to 2020 was $88.4 million, which is closer to Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Bakersfield, California, than to Texas' other major cities.\n'In Fort Worth, we're very willing to invest in oil and gas and real estate, but much past that we don't invest in really anything early stage,' Cushman said.\nStay on top of business news in Fort Worth.

He is surprised by the struggle to get funding.\nCushman isn't the only expert who seems to think the problem could lie in Fort Worth's culture that has historically prioritized investing in energy and real estate over technology and innovation.\nBryan Chambers, who teaches venture capital at the University of Texas at Dallas, said the generations of wealth that previously built Fort Worth haven't been focused on technology.\n'It's harder for them to transfer and affiliate,' said Chambers, who is also the president of Capital Factor, an Austin-based co-working space for entrepreneurs. 'Their networks are not technology. Their deal flow is not technology. Their comfort zone is not technology. That's just an inherent reality.'\nChambers said for this to change, there has to be a prioritized embrace of early-stage investing where key stakeholders in the community are willing to reinvest their capital back into technology.\n'The very wealthy people that are in town need to be intentional about supporting and growing and investing, because if they are not doing it, other people will not,' Chambers said. 'It's highly unlikely that other people will come from out of town to do it. Now, if they do it, other people will come from out of town to do it. Fundamentally, you need reinvestment in a community.'\nTrey Bowles, the managing director of Techstars Physical Health Fort Worth, acknowledged that early-stage funding is exceptionally risky, which doesn't sound attractive to somebody who has never done it before and doesn't understand the concept. Techstars, a global investment business that provides capital and mentorship to early-stage entrepreneurs, launched its Fort Worth program in 2022 for opportunities in physical health.\n'There's an unbelievable amount of philanthropic spirit in Fort Worth,' Bowles said. 'People see the value of giving, donating and investing in things that help people in Fort Worth and help people in need. We have to connect in the investor's mind why investing in early-stage is not only a philanthropic thing to do, it's helping empower, equip and develop entrepreneurship and economic freedom, and generational transformation of wealth.'\nBowles compared investing in early-stage startups to the quote, 'Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish and you'll feed him for a lifetime.'\n'That's what we're asking people to do here,' Bowles said. 'There's nothing more empowering to those in need than to provide for them the opportunity to do for themselves.'\nBowles said Fort Worth has more than enough money to invest, but it's a matter of finding investors willing to take on the risk and sacrifice their time during the lengthy process.\nLes Kreis, managing partner of Fort Worth-based venture capital investment firm Bios Partners, said he thinks the key to solving the lack of funds involves a city business development agenda that puts technology at the top.\nIf Fort Worth wants to get serious about venture capital, it will have to get serious about technology, Kreis said.\n'The solution is to build for the future, and since I feel so strongly that technology is the future, I think Fort Worth has to start preparing its workforce and business development today,' Kreis said.\nHayden Blackburn is managing director of Tech FW, a nonprofit startup accelerator and business incubator that has helped emerging technology companies grow since 1998. Blackburn said he thinks the solution is creating economic development incentives for local investors to contribute funding to local, high-growth companies earlier in their development.\nBlackburn proposed the possibility of a seed fund exclusively for startups operating and headquartered in Fort Worth.\n'There will always be those that are driven to solve problems and to take the risk of creating something new,' Blackburn said. 'Inspiration follows sparks of innovation, and it makes for an environment where everyone, from the individual citizen to corporate entities, believe they can be a part of creating positive change.'\nBowles, of Techstars Physical Health Fort Worth, said he thinks the real opportunity is at the city level, and the cost to invest in early-stage startups is insignificant compared to the greater economic impact of their potential success.\n'If we can continue to focus on pushing our business leaders to find ways to make it a priority, to make it a strategy or pillar of the city and of people of Fort Worth, we can have an ecosystem that is welcoming, that is conducive, that is supportive of entrepreneurs,' Bowles said. 'That is going to be the most important component.'\nWhy should a venture capital shortage matter to Fort Worth's business community?\nEntrepreneurship experts point toward the wide range of opportunities it can provide, including economic freedom for an individual or family, job creation, attracting young talent, building a more reputable city and recruiting new companies to the region.\n'Job growth doesn't happen at the small-business level or at the corporate level,' Bowles said. 'It happens at the hybrid startup level, so we need to have startups.'\nEntrepreneurship also creates innovation and disruption, which appeals to talent at early-stage companies and larger corporations, Bowles said.\nExperts pointed toward examples in cities like Dallas, Houston, Miami, Atlanta and Nashville. These cities haven't traditionally symbolized technology and innovation as significantly as Silicon Valley or Austin, but they have nonetheless seen large corporations drawn to their cities in correlation with a stronger surrounding entrepreneurship pipeline.\nBowles recalled his role co-chairing the Dallas Mayor's Task Force on Innovation and Entrepreneurship. He was frequently called in to talk with corporations looking to move to the Metroplex because they wanted to understand the innovation landscape.\n'That was important,' Bowles said. 'It was a factor in them determining whether or not they were going to move to the area.'\nBeyond the benefit of having a strong entrepreneurship pipeline, the technology that innovators and disruptors are working on every day in Fort Worth also plays a role in building a better community.\nIn the case of Sinclair Digital, Aslam was unable to find early-stage funding in Fort Worth, so he was forced to look elsewhere. Luckily for his business, Sinclair Digital was able to find its first round of funding near Atlanta, but not all Fort Worth-based startups are as fortunate.\nSince then, Sinclair Digital has developed a hotel in New Haven, Connecticut, that generates all its power on site and has plans for hotels in San Francisco and Porto, Portugal. Sinclair Digital is still looking for further funding to expand its research and development and make buildings more sustainable and carbon-neutral.\nA larger supply of local funding within Fort Worth could mean more energy efficient hotels and commercial buildings making a positive environmental impact on downtown and reducing the central district's carbon footprint.\n'We have our eyes on a couple of historic buildings in downtown,' Aslam said. 'Sinclair to us was version 1.0. We are already up to version 3.0 now.'\nAslam said he thinks local funding is always better, because it helps people invest in their own community.\n'I think it builds a better relationship to have your investors in your own town. It allows investors to have a sense of ownership. They feel proud of what they're creating, especially the kind of work we do.'",

    "summary": "Chicago, IL \u2013 February 27, 2023 \u2013 Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Visa Inc. V, Mastercard Inc. MA, Fiserv, Inc. FISV, Global Payments Inc. GPN and Equifax Inc. EFX.\nIndustry: Financial Transaction Services\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2058588/5-financial-transaction-stocks-to-gain-from-rising-digitization\nThe Financial Transaction Services industry is expected to benefit from growing transaction volumes, stemming from improved consumer spending and rebounding cross-border travels. Increased digitization across every sphere of life provides industry players with the perfect ground to capitalize on by leveraging their advanced digital prowess.\nContinuous pursuit of a merger and acquisition (M&A) strategy coupled with technology investments enables the players to devise a solid digital solutions suite. Companies like Visa Inc., Mastercard Inc., Fiserv, Inc., Global Payments Inc. and Equifax Inc. are well-placed to gain from the growth prospects of the industry.\nThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is part of the Financial Technology or the FinTech space, which includes companies with varying natures of businesses. The industry comprises card and payment processing and other solutions providers, ATM services and money remittance service providers, and providers of investment solutions to financial advisors.\nThe players in this segment operate their unique and proprietary global payments network that links issuers and acquirers around the globe to facilitate the switching of transactions, permitting account holders to use their products at millions of acceptance locations. Monetary transactions are executed through these networks, offering a convenient, quick and secure payment method in several currencies across the globe. The industry is benefiting from the ongoing digitization movement, triggered by the pandemic.\nWidespread Uptake of Contactless Payments: One of the most prominent trends noticed since the coronavirus outbreak is people's inclination toward adopting digital means across every sphere of life. With the cost-effective nature and ease of digital payments, there is no sign of the digital trend fading away anytime soon. Several flexible digital payment options, ranging from buy now, pay later (BNPL) solutions, cryptocurrency, biometrics, to QR code utilization, which consumers were earlier skeptical of, have started gaining popularity.\nAs a result, the financial transaction services industry players have been actively undertaking significant investments for building an upgraded suite and subsequently, attracting new clients as well as retaining the existing ones. Though the investments might result in escalating costs for the industry participants, digital prowess continues to fetch regular revenues and drives their margins in the long term.\nBetter Consumer Spending: Substantial personal savings made during the pandemic enable continued consumer spending despite looming fears of inflation and recession. Strong wage gains resulting from a tight labor market have positively influenced the purchasing power of consumers. The affinity of people to spend more implies increased utilization of product and service offerings of financial transaction service players.\nThis, in turn, boosts transaction volumes that contribute significantly to the revenues of industry participants. According to the 2023 Annual U.S. Economic Outlook issued by one of the digital payments leaders, Visa, consumer spending in the first half of 2023 is expected to remain higher than the 2022 figure and gradually pick up in the latter part of the year.\nImproved Cross-Border Travel: The receding impact of the pandemic led to the easing of border restrictions and renewed confidence in travel. These factors have led to a recovery in international travel, thus driving cross-border volumes of companies in the financial transaction services space that engage in global money transfers.\nIndustry participants having exposure to the cross-border business leave no stone unturned to devise platforms backed by an interconnected banking network and sound expertise in the seamless processing of digital payments. Amid the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel, these platforms inevitably reap benefits for the players.\nAn Active M&A Strategy: Participants of the financial transaction services space frequently resort to the M&A strategy to upgrade their capabilities in addition to making uninterrupted technology investments. The strategy reflects industry players' focus on bolstering their customer base, entering new markets and establishing a significant share across the global market.\nThe primary aim behind these deals is to bring about diversification benefits that differentiate an organization from its industry peers. The current year is expected to be exciting, with respect to M&A deals, according to PwC's Global M&A Industry Trends: 2023 Outlook.\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all-member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. The Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry is housed within the broader Zacks Business Services sector. It currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #76, which places it in the top 30% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\nOur research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\u00a0 The industry's positioning in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate.\nBefore we present a few stocks that you may want to buy or retain in your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\nThe Zacks Financial Transaction Services industry has outperformed not only the Zacks S&P 500 composite but also its sector as well in the past year.\nIn the said time frame, the industry has lost 6.8% compared with the S&P 500's 10.5% decline. The Zacks Business Services sector has slumped 15.7% in the same time frame.\nOn the basis of the forward 12-month Price/Earnings ratio, commonly used for valuing financial transaction services stocks, the industry is currently trading at 19.00X compared with the S&P 500's 17.97X and the sector's 23.57X.\nOver the last five years, the industry traded as high as 21.47X, as low as 15.97X and at the median of 19.36X.\nWe are presenting two stocks from the space currently carrying a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) and three stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). Considering the current industry scenario, it might be prudent for investors to buy or retain these stocks in their portfolio as these are well-placed to generate growth in the long haul.\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nVisa: Based in San Francisco, CA, Visa continues to benefit from growing business volumes, which in turn, are aided by improved payments volume, processed transactions and the ongoing recovery of cross-border travel. Continuous pursuit of acquisitions and significant technology investments equip this Zacks Rank #2 company to sustain its leading position in the rapidly-evolving payments market. Visa Token Service, Tap to Pay, Visa Direct and Click to Pay are some of the digital solutions developed by V in recent years to advance its digital platform.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Visa's fiscal 2023 earnings is pegged at $8.43 per share, indicating a 12.4% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues implies a 10% improvement from the year-ago actual. V's earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 8.62%. Shares of Visa have gained 3.5% in the past three months.\nFiserv: Headquartered in Brookfield, WI, Fiserv is aided by the sound performances of its segments, namely Merchant Acceptance, Fintech, and Payments and Network. Strength across its Clover and Carat platforms, an advanced suite of ISV Solutions and, growing demand for digital banking and digital solution offerings paves the way for long-term growth of this Zacks Rank #2 payment solutions provider. Acquisitions and a diversified product portfolio continues to bolster the digital capabilities and expand its customer base.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Fiserv's 2023 earnings is pegged at $7.30 per share, indicating a 12.5% rise from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues indicates a 6.3% improvement from the year-ago actual. FISV's earnings beat estimates in two of the last four quarters, matched the mark once and missed the same on the remaining occasion, the average being 0.22%. Its shares have advanced 13.7% in the past three months.\nMastercard: Headquartered in Purchase, NY, Mastercard is aided by growing worldwide gross dollar volume (GDV) and switched transactions coupled with rebounding cross-border volumes. Strong consumer spending despite continued inflationary headwinds also benefits MA's performance. This Zacks Rank #3 tech giant remains quite active in terms of acquisitions and collaborations to expand its addressable markets and drive new revenue streams. It has frequently undertaken significant investments to build a solid digital suite.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Mastercard's 2023 earnings is pegged at $12.13 per share, indicating a 13.9% improvement from the year-ago reported figure. The consensus mark for current-year revenues suggests 12.6% growth from the year-ago actual. MA's earnings beat estimates in each of the last four quarters, the average being 10.87%. Its shares have inched up 1.7% in the past three months.\nGlobal Payments: Based in Atlanta, GA, Global Payments' performance receives an impetus from strong performances across its Merchant Solutions, Issuer Solutions and Consumer Solutions units. The growing uptake of digital payment methods is expected to boost GPN's transaction volumes. This Zacks Rank #3 payments technology company remains quite active in pursuing technology investments that are leading to a shift in its business mix toward technology enablement.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for Global Payments' 2023 earnings is pegged at $10.28 per share, indicating a 10.3% rise from the year-ago reported figure.

    "summary": "Dangerous chemicals may be in your baby's clothes and that bag of dog food.\nThey are called forever chemicals, and they are linked to cancer and other serious health problems. Forever chemicals are known as PFAS and are highly toxic.\nNew testing found them in baby supplies \u2013 everything from bedding to clothes to toys \u2013 and in the packaging of some popular brands of dog and cat food.\nLadarius Jackson told Channel 2 investigative reporter Sophia Choi that his dog Cecilia is full of energy as she plays fetch at midtown Atlanta's Piedmont Park.\nBut what Jackson feeds her at night could slow her down with forever chemicals.\n'It's actually kind of scary to know that. I didn't know that actually,' Jackson said.\nThe Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit focused on protecting public health, had an independent lab test bags of seven popular pet food brands.\nThe tests found fluorine which indicates the presence of PFAS in all of them, including Cecilia's kibble.\n'That's what I use. That's exactly what I use,' Jackson said.\n\nMajor company vows to ban \u2018forever drugs' following intense pressure from customers\n\n\nVIDEO: Many of Georgia's freshwater fish are full of \u2018forever chemicals', study shows\nFurther testing found specific PFAS in four brands.\n'PFAS is so toxic at such low levels that any level really is cause for concern,' said Sydney Evans with the Environmental Working Group.\nShe said forever chemicals build up in our bodies and our pets over time and never break down in the environment.\n'There are quite a few health concerns. Earlier on studies were showing links to various kinds of cancer to thyroid issues,' said Evans.\nThe Pet Food Institute, which represents pet food makers, sent Channel 2 Action News a statement, saying:\n'As pet food makers and pet owners themselves, Pet Food Institute members are committed to the production of safe, nutritious pet food that meets or exceeds all state and federal product safety regulations. PFI understands that some pet owners may have concerns about the presence of PFAS in pet food packaging. For decades, specific PFAS have been authorized by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for food contact applications, such as use in cookware (e.g., 'Teflon') and food packaging materials for their non-stick and oil- and water-repellant properties. It is important to note that before FDA approves food-contact ingredient applications, the agency requires the manufacturer to submit an extensive review of scientific data to ensure that all the substances present in the food-contact material are safe for their intended use. Food packaging with FDA-approved food contact substances is designed and manufactured to protect the safety and integrity of food, and pet food makers encourage packaging suppliers to continuously look for superior packaging options. We look forward to advancements and innovations in science that lead to the availability of alternative, vetted packaging materials that are approved by the FDA, like the materials currently in use.'\nThe nonprofit also sent 34 samples of baby items including clothes, bedding, and toys to a lab. Again, all contained fluorine.\nFurther testing found detectable levels of PFAS in 10 samples.\nForever chemicals end up as dust in our homes where we can breathe them.\nThe biggest concern is pets and children crawling around on the floor.\n\n\u2018Life and death situation': Doctors forced to make tough decisions over nationwide drug shortage\n\nChannel 2 investigates if GA's power grid is safe after surge of attacks by violent extremists\n\n'And with that hand-to-mouth behavior, exploring the world through their hands, through their mouths, playing with toys, crawling on the ground, they're more likely to ingest the PFAS,' Evans said.\n'It's horrifying,' said Sally Baldwin, a mother and dog owner. 'And the only thing we seem to be able to do is educate ourselves.'\nChannel 2 Action News took the PFAS test results to Georgia U.S. Sen. Jon Ossoff, who is also a father.\n'I've got a 14-month-old baby girl, and it's a worst nightmare for a parent,' Ossoff said.\nHe shared exclusively with Channel 2 Action News a letter he sent to the EPA Administrator urging the agency to do more to identify products with PFAS.\n'I'm taking this action now because we need to understand definitely whether, in baby's clothes or crib sheets or other products, there is hazards to their health posed by these PFAS chemicals,' Ossoff said.\nForever chemicals are in everything from some drinking water to personal care products.\nBut Evans said you should try to limit your exposure.\n'All of that is going to make a difference for your exposure levels, for your body burden, and ultimately the risks for health effects in the end,' Evans said.\nFor our pets, holistic veterinarian Dr. Judy Morgan said to do your homework.\n'Definitely stop purchasing the foods that were found to have these very high levels of the PFAS in them and switch to something that is going to be a healthier alternative for your pet,' Morgan said.\nThat is something Jackson said he is going to do.\n'Now, I know what to keep it away and let my friends know, \u2018Hey, look, don't use that,'' Jackson said.\nEvans said you can reduce your exposure to PFAS by filtering your water.\nYou also can stay away from stain-resistant and waterproof products since they tend to have more.\nYou can cook at home to avoid PFAS in food wrappers and take-out containers.\nYou also can make dusting a regular part of your cleaning routine to get it out of your house.\nIN OTHER NEWS:",

    "summary": "The post Bully Announces New Album Lucky for You, Shares 2023 Tour Dates appeared first on Consequence.\nLucky for us, Bully is releasing a new album.\u00a0Lucky for You,\u00a0the latest release from Alicia Bognanno's indie rock project, is out June 2nd via Sub Pop, and the announcement comes with lead single 'Days Move Slow' as well as new 2023 tour dates.\nA press release promises that\u00a0Lucky for You\u00a0comes chock-full of 'punk grit, crunchy shoegaze bliss, and an explosive Britpop bop,' and if we know anything about Bully, we can expect plenty of guitar shredding and feisty vocals.\nBognanno recorded the album last year between MMK Studios and her Nashville home: 'With every record, I feel more and more secure in terms of doing what I want,' she says in a statement. 'For this one, I wanted to be as creative as possible with these songs.' Pre-orders for the album are ongoing.\nMuch of\u00a0Lucky for You\u00a0was inspired by the passing of Bognanno's beloved dog Mezzi, and 'Days Move Slow' came about soon after the loss: 'Mezzi was living, breathing proof that I was worthy of being loved,' she adds. 'There was nothing else I could do [after she passed away] except sit down and write.'\n'Days Move Slow' might've been borne from tragedy, but sonically, it's a blistering pop-rock anthem that seems to channel catharsis through its fiery energy, making for a perfect tribute to a missed best friend.\nBully's tour dates begin in South Carolina on April 15th and will make stops at venues such as New York's Racket, Chicago's Thalia Hall, and a hometown show at Nashville's Brooklyn Bowl \u2014 not to mention her previously-announced dates supporting Pixies with Franz Ferdinand later this spring.\nTickets for Bully's headlining shows are on sale on Friday, March 24th, at 10:00 a.m. local, and you can find yours at Ticketmaster. After they're on sale, you can also find tickets at Stubhub, where orders are 100% guaranteed through Stubhub's FanProtect program. Stubhub is a secondary market ticketing platform, and prices may be higher or lower than face value, depending on demand.\nBelow, listen to 'Days Move Slow,' and then keep scrolling to check out the details for\u00a0Lucky for You and Bully's 2023 tour schedule.\nLast month, Bully shared her Soccer Mommy collab 'Lose You,' which is also set to appear on\u00a0Lucky for You.\u00a0The album marks Bully's follow-up to 2020's\u00a0Sugaregg.\nLucky for You Artwork:\nLucky for You Tracklist: 1.

    "excerpt": "Florida's proposal signals that the battle over reproductive rights will continue long after the Supreme Court's decision.",
    "summary": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. \u2014 Thousands of people have traveled to Florida from as far away as Texas to end their pregnancies since the Supreme Court dismantled Roe v. Wade in June \u2014 and Republicans want to put a stop to it.\nFlorida Republicans, who hold supermajorities in the Legislature, proposed a ban last week on abortions after six weeks of pregnancy \u2014 or two weeks after someone misses their period \u2014 and with Gov. Ron DeSantis' support, passage is almost guaranteed.\nAbortion providers and Democrats are reeling over the proposed ban and what it means for people in Florida and those who travel to the Sunshine State specifically to get abortions. In the wake of the Supreme Court's decision, roughly 4,000 people traveled to Florida for the procedure, including from Texas and Alabama, where abortion is outlawed at any stage of pregnancy with some narrow exceptions when a patient's life is in danger.\n'We're talking about thousands of people whose care will be delayed or new travel plans have to be made,' Florida Rep. Anna Eskamani, a Democrat who previously worked at Planned Parenthood, said. 'It shows this is truly a bill to be cruel just to be cruel.'\nFlorida last year banned people from getting abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy, with no exceptions for victims of rape or incest. But that law is still much less restrictive than other states across the South.\nFlorida's proposal signals that the battle over reproductive rights will continue long after the high court's decision and will be a major factor in the 2024 election cycle , especially as DeSantis eyes a likely presidential bid. DeSantis' support for the bill shows he's eager to continue courting the right wing of the GOP, regardless of how further restricting abortion will be received during a general election.\nBut Florida's legislation also highlights how a network of providers in the state, who created an infrastructure to help patients from Georgia, Mississippi and elsewhere get abortions in the state, will need to change tactics if the six-week ban is approved.\nMonthly reports obtained from the Florida Agency for Health Care Administration show that 6,708 people came from outside the state to get an abortion last year, a more than 37 percent increase compared to 2021. The sharpest increase in visitors began after the Supreme Court ruling was handed down. There were 3,917 out-of-state abortions last year between June 1 and Dec. 31, a more than 140-percent increase compared to the same time period in 2021.\nMore than 82,000 people total received abortions in 2022.\nClara Trullenque, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood of South, East and North Florida, said caseloads at clinics along the state's northern border quadrupled after the high court ruling.\n'Our health centers in Tallahassee and Jacksonville receive more patients from other states where abortion access is even more restricted than it is in Florida,' Trullenque said in an email. 'We are continuing to hire additional staff, extend hours and make every accommodation we can to ensure we can serve all of our patients.'\nAmber Gavin, a vice president for A Woman's Choice, an abortion clinic in Jacksonville, Fla., said a patchwork of national funding organizations, regional abortion support groups and local clinics emerged to help manage the skyrocketing number of patients.\n'We're working really closely with local and national abortion funds to make sure people who reach out to us can get care they need and that we get the care we need,' Gavin said. 'There's specialized funding to make sure they are able to get the funds to get their care.'\nA Woman's Choice's clinic also provides information to patients from outside Florida who are looking to the Sunshine State for help. Its website states: 'Need Help? We help with feeds, travel, and more. We provide abortion care from everywhere. In fact, your abortion could be fully covered if your State has banned or Severely Restricted Abortion Care, including: AL, AK, GA, KY, LA, MS, MO, OK, TN, and WV.'\nAnother complication is Florida's 24-hour wait period law. A state circuit court ruling threw out a lawsuit challenging a requirement that people wait a day between an initial clinic visit and receiving an abortion. Gavin said that rule requires most out-of-state patients to make a two-day trip to Florida, and the subsequent costs of airfare, lodging, and child care quickly pile up.\n'It's already a barrier to have to come here,' Gavin said. 'We're talking about folks who are having to take off one to two days at work, the cost of travel and lodging.'\nData provided by AHCA, the state health agency, shows that most people who came to the state for an abortion over the past few years hailed from Alabama and Georgia but the number of clinics in North Florida has since dropped. In May of last year, AHCA shut down the only clinic in Pensacola after at least three patients suffered complications that were investigated for malpractice. With the Pensacola clinic closed, people were forced to seek access in already overwhelmed offices in Tallahassee and Jacksonville.\n'They've just been coming from all over,' Gavin said.\nThe June Supreme Court ruling that led to the explosion of out-of-state visitors prompted regional support and logistics organizations, such as the Atlanta-based ARC Southeast, to reallocate the dollars it receives from much larger abortion fundraising groups to switch from covering doctor's bills to paying for travel and lodging.\nARC Southeast Healthline Manager Elsie Vazquez said before the Roe ruling, only a small fraction of the money her group received went to those logistical costs. Now, at least half of that money goes toward those ancillary costs, which she called 'practical support.'\n'Due to the bans in many of the [southeast] states, hundreds of folks are having to travel long distances to get care,' Vazquez said. 'And it's one of the biggest barriers they face apart from paying for their abortion.'",

As a reminder, today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Amy Hopkins, Vice President, Investor Relations.

And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Paul.\nPaul T. McDermott\nThank you, Amy. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for joining us today. We ended the year with a strong fourth-quarter performance and 2023 is off to a good start with solid operating fundamentals and favorable demand indicators. We are reiterating our 2023 guidance, which reflects double-digit same-store NOI and core FFO growth. Our investment-grade balance sheet is in great shape with low leverage and ample liquidity, and we have no debt maturities until 2025. We feel very good about our AFFO growth outlook, and we are increasing our quarterly dividend by approximately 6%. The economic outlook continues to evolve, and we will likely face a slowing economy this year. While we are not immune, our mid-market strategy is designed to outperform across cycles and to provide relative insulation during downturns when residents are more likely to trade down to a lower rent level instead of trading up. Over the past 5- and 10-year periods, our target vintages have outperformed newer vintages in our respective markets. Towards the end of last year, we began to see headlines surrounding job cuts for high-wage technology positions due to the intentional cooling of the economy by the Fed. However, in the Washington Metro, the tech-heavy, informational and professional, scientific and technical sectors continue to grow, up 2.7% and 2%, respectively, year-over-year. As recently highlighted in the Wall Street Journal, a study of software engineering job postings at year-end found that Washington region has more job openings in this field than the San Francisco Bay Area. The strength in these jobs is particularly evident in Northern Virginia, where most of our portfolio is located and where the information sector, which includes software engineering jobs grew at a brisk rate of 5.6% in 2022. The Washington Metro is known to have the most stable employment of all gateway markets. This stability supported very strong credit performance throughout the pandemic as we sustained 99% collection rates, and we expect to continue to experience solid collection trends. Furthermore, multifamily rent growth for the Washington Metro is expected to outperform the U.S. average this year and nearly all the major gateway markets. In Atlanta, the regional economy is projected to fare well in the face of increased macroeconomic and wins in 2023, maintaining job growth of over 1% according to Oxford Economics. Over the long term, we continue to believe that Atlanta's industrial mix will drive outsized job creation, wage growth, and net migration, supporting sustained demand for apartments that are affordable to the largest segments of the renter market. In terms of the potential impact from new supply in a slowing economy, our price points are well below the rent levels for new deliveries. In the Washington Metro, our monthly rents are over $600 below nearby Class-A communities. In Atlanta, our monthly rents are over $500 below nearby Class-A communities. Furthermore, our communities are not located in areas that are receiving high supply. Almost 88% of the new supply in the Atlanta Metro is delivering outside of M submarkets in 2023 and 2024. And in Washington, development is highly concentrated in the region's core versus our suburban focused with 84% of units under construction inside the Capital Beltway. Again, in both markets, the new supply is priced above our price points for different renter cohorts. In terms of the impact of a slowing economy on the cost of homeownership, the national cost of owning a home compared to renting a single-family starter home is the highest it's been in over 20 years. The cost of owning a home in our markets has grown more than renting an apartment over the past few years and now stands at nearly $600 per month or 28% above our rents in Atlanta and over $1,200 per month or 43% above our rents in the Washington Metro. Even after factoring the potential for home price declines, homeownership will remain unaffordable for median-income renters in our markets. To summarize, our portfolio offers downside protection and a slowing economy for the following reasons: First, our resident base is less exposed to job losses. Second, our price points serve as a buffer during periods of supply pressure. Third, we do not have exposure to high-supply submarkets. And lastly, housing remains undersupplied in our markets, driving up the cost of homeownership, which is particularly impactful for median-income households. Our rent levels are affordable for the largest and most underserved renter cohorts and our communities to benefit from sustained demand for affordable rental options over the near and longer term. We are now in the final phase of our infrastructure transformation, which includes transitioning community-level operations to L management. The process has been seamless thus far, and we will have nearly 40% of our homes under management by next week, over 50% by the end of the quarter, and all communities under management by the end of the summer. The full spectrum of operational benefits is extensive, and we continue to identify opportunities to deliver operational upside once our community onboarding process is complete. We built an operating platform that is highly scalable, and we continue to see the opportunity to deliver positive operating leverage by growing our portfolio and expanding it into the Sunbelt markets. We are confident in our investment strategy and our ability to create value through thoughtful capital allocation. The markets that we are targeting have industries with the best long-term growth prospects and a growing need for affordable rental options for median incomes. While deal volumes remain muted, we are actively underwriting opportunities. We will be ready to act when the time is right and will only pursue opportunities that we expect will create value for our shareholders and align with our strategy and mission. This year, we plan to extend the rollout of Smart Home technology to all our communities. We designed our Smart Home initiative to improve our residents' day-to-day experience at investment levels that make sense for mid-market price points. Our initial program includes smart locks, smart thermostats, smart lights, and water leak sensors. Overall, these technologies will provide ease of living for our residents, reduce our operating expenses, advance our environmental goals, and enable a better digital experience in the form of self-guided tours for potential residents. I am pleased to share that we made substantial progress on our ESG initiatives during 2022. Delivering industry-leading ESG performance for value-oriented community is core to our goal of elevating the standard for value living. To quickly summarize our achievements, we achieved our highest GRESB score to date, achieved our greenhouse gas and water goals, aligned our reporting with GRI standards, joined the better climate initiatives, increased our multifamily sustainability certifications, and expanded the number of EV chargers at our communities. As we transition our communities to L management, we are advancing financial inclusion by providing our residents the ability to boost their credit scores by submitting on-time rent payments to all 3 credit bureaus at no cost. ESG is core to our mission of delivering a superior living experience for mid-market rents, and we are pleased with the progress we made in 2022 and look forward to keeping you updated on our ESG goals. Before I turn it over to Steve Riffee, to provide an update on our operating trends and to cover full-year and fourth-quarter performance, I'd like to say a few words of gratitude. This is Steve's last earnings call with us ahead of his retirement on February 28. I cannot thank Steve enough for the dedication that he has shown this company over the past 8 years. His leadership and vision were instrumental to our transformation, and he is leaving us with a team that is well-prepared to drive our company forward. He will be greatly missed by everyone who worked with him, and we wish him the best in his retirement.\nStephen E. Riffee\nThank you, Paul. I'm grateful to you and to our team for all we were able to do together, and I'm looking forward to the growth ahead for our company going forward. Now starting with our operating trends. The year is off to a strong start, and demand indicators continue to look good through the winter months. Year-to-date traffic and application volumes are up on a year-over-year basis, extending the trend that we experienced during the second half of last year. Effective new lease rate growth was 1.1% and the effective renewal lease rate growth was 10.1%, which blends to 5.7% for same-store move-ins that took place during the fourth quarter. Thus far this year, demand trends remained solid, and lease rates have increased since December. Effective blended lease rate growth averaged 4.5% for January move-ins comprised of renewal lease rate growth of 8.8% and new lease rate growth of 1.3%. For February move-in so far, effective blended lease rate growth increased to 5.8% for our same-store communities comprised of renewal lease rate growth of 9.1% and new lease rate growth of 3.7%. Our revenue maximization strategy prioritizes occupancy over lease rate growth during the winter months. And as such, we adjusted pricing to sustain occupancy during our lightest volume months. New lease rates are on an upward trend, and we are currently signing new leases with effective rate increases of over 4% on average. Looking forward, we expect new lease rates to continue to increase to the mid-single digits in the spring and summer leasing season, followed by a decline to the low single digits toward next winter. Renewal lease rates remain very strong, and we are currently sending out renewal offers for April lease expirations with effective rate increases of over 7% on average. And so far, we are experiencing high renewal acceptance rates. We expect renewal rates to trend down from the current high single-digit level, eventually converging to a more normalized level in the low single digits by the end of the year. All in all, we feel good about the lease rate growth we captured during the fourth quarter and the trends that we're seeing now heading into the spring leasing season. Lease rates tend to be weaker during the winter. And while new lease rates moderated through January, renewal rates remained very strong all through the winter. The combined new and renewals that we are quoting for March and April are providing upward trending rent levels just as we expected, heading into the spring leasing season. These are positive winter months, adding to historically high embedded growth as we head into the spring months. Occupancy averaged 95% during the quarter for our same-store portfolio and has increased 30 basis points on a year-to-date basis. As of the second week of February, same-store occupancy was 95.6%, positioning us to continue to drive rent growth and capture more of our loss to lease. Retention was 62% during the quarter, which is a slight sequential increase as we continue to experience high renewal demand, supporting very strong renewal rate growth of approximately 9% year-to-date. Average effective monthly rent per home grew 9.7% in the fourth quarter compared to the prior year and 7.6% for the full year, reflecting the impact of the very strong lease rate growth we captured during 2022. For our portfolio, average monthly rent grew significantly more in the second half of 2022 to provide historically high embedded growth at the end of the year. Our current rent levels in February, plus the March move-ins we signed represent rental growth of approximately 5%, which is nearly 70% of the rental rate growth that we expect for the full year. Our current loss to lease, which represents the difference between current asking rents and our in-place rents is approximately 4.4%, and we expect our loss to lease to increase into the spring, given the solid demand trends that we're seeing today. We are where we expected to be heading into the spring and summer leasing season and a line of sight on the busiest leasing months will significantly increase over the next 2 to 3 months. By June, we expect to have locked in 90% of our total rental rate growth for the year. We feel good about the visibility that we have today and where rent growth is tracking compared to our expectations. Moving on to renovations. We completed more than 300 full renovations during 2022 and an ROI of over 13%, excluding the rent growth that we achieved on comparable unrenovated units. We expect to be closer to our historical renovation run rate of approximately 600 units per year in 2023 and for renovation-led value creation to drive higher rent and NOI growth over the next few years. Executing value-add renovation at low-teen cash on cash returns on average remains a key part of our growth strategy. Now turning to our full year and fourth quarter financial results. Core FFO for the fourth quarter was $0.24 per diluted share, representing year-over-year growth of over 40%, driven by strong growth in rental income and the full deployment of our commercial portfolio sale proceeds. Core FFO for 2022 was $0.88 per share, in line with the midpoint of our guidance range. Multifamily same-store revenue grew by 8.9% for the quarter and 7.3% for the full year due to growth in rental rates, lower concessions, higher occupancy, and an 11% year-over-year decrease in bad debt for the full year. Operating expenses grew 4% for the fourth quarter and 4.6% for the full year, driven by noncontrollable expenses, such as real estate taxes and utilities. Multifamily same-store NOI grew 11.6% for the fourth quarter and 8.8% for the full year. This represents the end of a strong year, even while executing our transformation, and now we have excellent momentum turning into 2023. Now it is my privilege to turn it over to Steve Freishtat, who I have great confidence in. Steve will cover financing updates and our 2023 outlook. As we announced in November, Steve is succeeding me as Chief Financial Officer following my retirement at the end of this month. Steve brings extensive knowledge of capital markets, strategic transactions, capital allocation, public company operations, and financial planning. He's been instrumental in the execution of our multifamily transformation, and I know he is going to be an excellent CFO. He also has an excellent team that has been through all of this with us and are ready for new opportunities to create value.\nSteven Freishtat\nThanks, Steve. You're leaving me with a great team, and we are very excited for the opportunity to continue to build on everything you helped to create over the last 8 years. Now I'll start with our balance sheet. With an annualized fourth-quarter net debt to EBITDA of 4.8x, over $650 million of availability on our line of credit, no secured debt, and no maturities until 2025, our balance sheet is in excellent shape. In keeping with our proactive approach to managing our debt maturity ladder, on January 10, we executed a new 2-year $125 million term loan with 2 1-year extension options. We used the proceeds to pay down our previous $100 million term loan with no prepayment penalty and a portion of the balance on our line of credit. Our new loan has a variable interest rate of adjusted SOFR plus 95 basis points. At a time when many banks are tightening their lending requirements, we have taken steps to ensure our financial flexibility and increase our liquidity. We feel good about our ability to successfully navigate market volatility while executing on our strategy. Now turning to our outlook for 2023. We are reiterating our 2023 core FFO guidance range of $0.96 to $1.04 per fully diluted share, which implies double-digit year-over-year growth. Same-store multifamily NOI growth is expected to range from 9% to 11%, which reflects year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Further building on the double-digit NOI growth achieved in the second half of 2022. Non-same-store multifamily NOI is expected to range from $12.75 million to $13.75 million in 2023. While this guidance range does not reflect the impact of potential acquisitions, we had more than $650 million of availability on our line of credit as of year-end, and we are running below our targeted leverage levels. We will continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities in our target markets and will further pursue acquisitions when they create additional value for shareholders. Other same-store NOI, which consists solely of Watergate 600 is expected to range from $13 million to $13.75 million. We are slightly reducing our guidance for G&A net of core adjustments through a range of $25.75 million to $27 million. We expect G&A to decline in 2024 as we realize the full-year benefits of internalizing multifamily operations and then to remain stable as we scale our portfolio when the time is right to do so. Our G&A guidance excludes the impact of transformation investments for our platform and our full integration, which we now expect to be between $3 million and $4 million. Interest expense is now expected to range between $29 million and $30 million, which incorporates a higher anticipated future Fed funds rate as the interest rate outlook has shifted since we announced our 2023 guidance last year as well as the impact of our new term loan. The new term loan is subject to our existing swap agreement, which fixes the interest rate on $100 million at 2.16% through July 21 of this year. We remain very confident in our NOI growth outlook and are currently within our core FFO guidance range. However, recent Fed actions have put pressure on our midpoint. If expectations were to shift further, we will update our interest expense guidance again and possibly our core FFO guidance range. We finished 2022 with a 75% AFFO payout ratio. As Paul mentioned, we are increasing our quarterly dividend by approximately 6% to $0.18 per share, reflecting confidence in our growth in 2023 and beyond and the strength of our AFFO growth profile. We expect our core AFFO payout ratio for this year to be at or below our mid-70s target. And with that, I will now turn the call back to Paul.\nPaul T. McDermott\nThank you, Steve. To conclude, we are where we expected to be at this point in the year. We feel good about our ability to deliver double-digit core FFO growth, which will be driven primarily by rent growth as nearly 70% of that rent growth is already locked in. We are on track to complete the transition of our portfolio to L management by this summer and to begin to see the benefits of that transition and our Smart Home initiatives in 2024. Our strategy offers growth as well as relative insulation during downturns, and we expect to benefit from sustained demand for quality, affordable rental options over the near and longer term. And now operator, I'd like to open it up for questions.\nOperator\nCertainly. At this time, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session. (Operator Instructions) Your first question for today is coming from Michael Lewis with Truist Securities.\nMichael Lewis\nGreat. Thank you. Steve, you'll certainly be missed and I wish you all the best in retirement and congratulations to Steve, other Steve, on taking over the role. My first question, I was wondering if you could provide some of the components of the same-store NOI guidance, occupancy, revenue growth, or expense growth or any details you could share?\nSteven Freishtat\nYes, Michael, this is Steve Freishtat and I'll take a first crack at that. So to get to our NOI guidance, we look at our revenue growth expectation of about 8.5%. Of that is primarily driven by rental revenue growth, where we're expecting that to be almost 7%. And as we talked about in our prepared remarks, we've captured approximately 5% of that already with our in-place leases and leases signed but not yet moved in. So we're at 70%. We're expecting that number to be 90% by June. So -- and that leaves about an additional 2% of additional rent growth that is expected to be captured over the remainder of the year. The difference between the 7% and the 8.5% is smaller contributions from line items like other income and declines in bad debt. On the expense side, we're expecting expenses to go up about 7% net of reimbursements. And that's primarily driven by 3 line items. The first is payroll, which we're seeing pressure on salaries. And we're also ramping up positions ahead of our onboarding that we're currently going through for our communities. The second one is taxes as we're seeing taxes reset. We're seeing pressure on expenses from increased taxes. And then the third one is utilities. We're seeing utilities higher in electricity and gas for 2023, but that's mitigated somewhat by reimbursements where we see reimbursement at about 60% to 70%. So that's really the buildup to our 9% to 11% NOI growth.\nMichael Lewis\nYes. That's great detail. My second question, how should we think about the upside from getting properties onto your internal property management platform? I don't know if you have -- is there an operating margin improvement that you're measuring or seeing that you can point to? Or how do you kind of measure and quantify the longer-term benefits from that transition?\nSteven Freishtat\nYes, Michael, this is Steve again. I'll take that one as well. So as we said, we are -- we have onboarded as of next week, almost 40% of our communities by the end of the quarter would be at 50% and have them all on board by the end of the summer. And we think when we can get there in the mall on board that there are efficiencies that we can take advantage of. Just examples of it are centralization, better revenue management through occupancy initiatives, smart buildings and ability to produce R&M, maintenance efficiencies, and global contract strategy. So we see a lot of potential upside from being able to take advantage of opportunities of managing our own communities. But in addition to that, we've talked about scalability before that we're building out a platform that is scalable. So when we think about being able to double the unit count of this company and keep G&A essentially the same from where it is now, but that's even an additional opportunity and an additional driver for growth.\nMichael Lewis\nGreat. And I'll try to squeeze in one more, if I can. It seems like there's more investor demand and liquidity in the market for multifamily than for some of the other property types for all the advantages that you spoke about. But there's still this bid-ask spread that's kind of limiting transaction. So I'm wondering what are your target returns for acquisitions today? Or how are you looking at potential deals given what's happened in the cost of capital? And I know you're still looking, but maybe there's a pause here as that betas kind of shakes out. So how are you kind of thinking about that and what might be attractive?\nStephen E. Riffee\nWell, in terms of Michael, our observations on what we're seeing in the marketplace right now, first and foremost, there's not a lot of product in the market on a relative basis, if you look at the year-over-year numbers of what is in there. A lot of the brokers that we interact with as well as the owners have a large BOV pipeline. And we expect groups that are in the Odyssey funds. They're waiting on appraisals from Altus. And I think, as you know, appraisals tend to lag the markets anywhere from 6 to 9 months. We think those appraisals are going to hit. We think second quarter will have a lot of mark-to-market activity. And we believe that we're going to start -- we'll have a more robust second half of the year, as we've said before. These are funds that are still dealing with the denominator effect and have to go through their own processes mark-to-market. But really, the sellers that we're seeing right now, they are only selling either, there's a liquidity requirement, i.e., a Q or they're funding other parts of their operations. As you alluded to, I don't think there's any question that there's enough capital, but we would also say and in talking to folks that are thinking of taking product to the market. The ask is really coming towards the bid. I think the gap is going to be closing, and we'll be closing as we progress through the year. In terms of kind of what we look for right now, I mean, look, a lot of the institutional capital remains on the sidelines. A lot of that private capital is the most active, and they're trying to take advantage of some -- the in-place leverage, the low leverage that they can utilize. I mean, I think for us, it's going to be about -- it's going to be maintaining our continued discipline in our underwriting. In reference to the top line, we are and always have been, I think, more realistic about rent growth and about our trade-out. And as Steve Freishtat alluded to, we are being disciplined in how we look at expenses, labor, insurance, property taxes, utilities. And I also think we're -- you have to have discipline around that residual cap rate. We think right now risk is being priced appropriately. Our particular focus right now. And we're very sensitive to replacement costs. But in terms of what we're seeing out there, Michael, our cap rates can vary depending on the amount of risk we want to take on. But we're seeing cores kind of in the 4 to 5, core pluses, 4.25% to 5.25% in value add in that 5.25% to 5.5%, and we've seen that go as high as the 6. So unlevered IRRs are in the 7% range, levered IRRs are in that 10% to 14% range depending on what risk bucket you want to play in. But I think as Steve alluded to also, we are going to be looking at longer-term value creation for our shareholders, and we will price our assets appropriately. It's not just about NOI going in cap rates. It's about longer-term growth and value creation for our shareholders.\nOperator\nYour next question for today is coming from Alan Peterson at Green Street.\nAlan Peterson\nI was just hoping you guys could share the breakout between the legacy Mid-Atlantic same-store portfolio and the new 23 additions. Just your expectations on NOI growth between those 2 groups would be super helpful.\nSteven Freishtat\nYes. I mean, so our 23 same-store pool, so there were 2 communities that came into the same-store pool this year. And we are seeing growth in the Atlanta portfolio higher than D.C. So -- but D.C. is, Amy, go ahead.\nAmy Hopkins\nThis is Amy. Our Atlanta communities are contributing about 60 basis points to our NOI growth for the full year.\nAlan Peterson\nPerfect. And in regards to the recent term loan extension, I was just hoping you can provide some color around the banks. And if there's any banks that are starting to close off lending or lending activity for multifamily product today, did you guys have any difficulty with that term loan extension versus, call it, this time 2 years ago?\nSteven Freishtat\nI'm sorry, Alan, can you repeat the question? We lost the voice for just a second.\nAlan Peterson\nYes. In regards to the term loan extension, I was just hoping if you could provide back any color if there's any difficulty right now getting those term loan extensions through given that banks -- some banks may have closed off lending activity for multifamily activity today.\nSteven Freishtat\nYes, Alan, this is Steve Freishtat. What we've heard from the banks is that they are being more selective in this",

    "excerpt": "From higher food prices on grocery store shelves to soaring prices for airline tickets, the cost of everyday life has gotten more expensive \u2014 93 percent of U.S. adults have experienced higher prices\u2026",
    "summary": "From higher food prices on grocery store shelves to soaring prices for airline tickets, the cost of everyday life has gotten more expensive\u00a0 \u2014 93 percent of U.S. adults have experienced higher prices over the past year, according to a Bankrate survey as of February 2022 polling.\nInflation impacts everyone differently, however. Below, we dive into how your individual spending habits may be affected by inflation. Learning how to calculate your own personal inflation rate can help you be better financially prepared in 2023.\n\n46% of economists from Bankrate's Fourth-Quarter Economic Indicator Poll say inflation will largely be as expected over the next 12-18 months, as of December 2022.\n55% of employed Americans say their income has not kept up with the increase in household expenses due to inflation.\n74% of U.S. adults who have experienced higher prices in the past year report that higher prices are hurting them financially.\n81% of U.S. adults have seen higher grocery prices.\n73% of U.S. adults have seen higher gas prices.\n57% of U.S. adults have seen higher restaurant prices.\nInflation refers to the cost of goods and services increasing over a sustained period of time. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) percentage change for all items is up 6.4 percent from January 2022 to January 2023, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS).\nRising inflation means that many of the average person's expenses, from bills and utilities to groceries and gas, will rise, too. That's why prices on goods like eggs may seem a lot more expensive than they did a year ago.\nThough the national inflation rate is 6.4 percent, prices for different categories will vary. Groceries, which the CPI calls 'food at home,' has risen 11.3 percent as of January, while the cost of apparel has only risen 3.1 percent, in comparison.\nInflation has been a source of worry for many over the past year, but it may not continue to rise in 2023 like it did in 2022. Inflation has fallen since the CPI reported a 10-year high of 9.1 percent in June 2022. Nearly half of economists polled by Bankrate say that inflation is likely to be as expected over the next 12-18 months, and only 15 percent think it will rise significantly more than expected.\nSeeing everyday items grow more expensive is causing consumers to change their habits to make room in their budgets. Bankrate found in March 2022, before record inflation in summer 2022 and the resulting interest hikes, that 84 percent of those experiencing higher prices have taken at least one action as a result:\nSource: BankrateNotes: Percentages are in reference to survey respondents who reported experiencing higher prices; Respondents could select multiple responses.\nThe national inflation rate generally influences the average household's spending, but a personal inflation rate is actually a better indicator of how your own expenses may have risen over the last year.\nYour household expenses likely don't perfectly match the average American's, and depending on factors like the people in your household, your age and where you live, the St. Louis Fed explains your personal inflation rate will differ.\n'If the inflation rate is, let's say, 2 percent at the national level, that does not necessarily mean that for your individual household the expenditures may have changed by 2 percent,' Arindam Bandopadhyaya, an interim dean and professor of finance at the University of Massachusetts Boston, said. 'It may have been more than that or less than that.'\nThese figures differ in part due to people spending their money differently. Different goods have risen in price more than others over the past year. For example, cereal, bread, rice and other grains rose in price 15.6 percent between January 2022 and January 2023. However, if your grocery budget typically includes more meat and eggs instead, you would see a smaller increase, since that category's price only rose 8.1 percent year-over-year.\nThis is how common household purchases have risen year-over-year:\nConsumer staple\nPrice increase from January 2022-January 2023\nCereals and bakery products (such as rice, pasta and bread)\n15.6%\n\n14%\nMeat, poultry, fish and eggs\n8.1%\nFruits and vegetables\n7.2%\nConsumer staple\nPrice increase from January 2022-January 2023\nAirline fares\n25.6%\nPublic transportation\n17.1%\nNew vehicles\n5.8%\nConsumer staple\nPrice increase from January 2022-January 2023\nEnergy services (such as electricity and gas)\n15.6%\nRent of primary residence\n8.6%\nWater, sewer and trash collection services\n5%\nWireless telephone services\n1.4%\nConsumer staple\nPrice increase from January 2022-January 2023\nDelivery services\n14.3%\nPets and pet products\n11.9%\nPersonal care products (such as hair, dental and cosmetics)\n7.1%\nAdmission to movies, theaters and concerts\n6.5%\nDay care and preschool\n5.9%\nHaircuts and other personal care services\n5.2%\nWomen and girls' apparel\n3.7%\nMedicinal drugs\n3.2%\nMen's and boys' apparel\n3.1%\nAirline tickets have seen some of the highest increases over the last year, with tickets selling for 25.6 percent higher in January 2023 than the year previously. But other goods related to energy and transportation, such as household energy bills, delivery services and public transportation have also risen in double-digit percentages (15.6 percent, 14.3 percent and 17.1 percent, respectively) year-over-year.\nThe cost of cereals and grains have risen more than any other grocery item (15.6 percent year-over-year), in part due to shortages of grain since the Russian invasion of Ukraine last year. Grain is a major Ukraine export, and backlogs are still significant, according to the European Union.\nTo start, you can find an idea of your personal inflation rate by looking at your typical expenses by category \u2014 such as housing, utilities, food and clothing \u2014 over the last year. Comparing those to the BLS' categories, some of which are listed above, will give you a start on knowing how much those prices have increased and how much your typical purchases and expenses have risen in price due to inflation.\nAn online calculator can also allow you to plug in your expenses for more precise information.\nSuppose you don't have easy access to your spending over the past year. In that case, you can check out the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta's personal inflation calculator, which looks at your age, household size, where you live, income and other factors to show how much more you are paying for expenses than last year.\nFor example, a 30-year-old man renting alone with a high school education and making $50,000 a year is expected to have a higher CPI (7.5 percent) than the national average (6.5 percent), according to the Fed's calculations.\nIn comparison, a 45-year-old woman who owns her home and lives with a spouse and two children, making over $70,000 a year and with a college degree, is expected to have a very similar CPI (6.9 percent) to the national average.\nKnowing how your expenses have risen is only the first step in taking control of your budget. Consider these next steps:\nEdit your budget. If your grocery budget, for example, no longer seems feasible due to the rising cost of items, don't be afraid to edit it to a more realistic figure. Look at your bank statement to see how you have spent in the past months, and consider temporarily changing your budget to accurately reflect what you might spend amid inflation. Once you've adjusted your budget, try implementing cost-cutting measures to keep expenses like groceries down, like shopping at multiple stores for the best price or buying in bulk.\nAdjust your goals. If your budget has changed due to rising cost of items, you may want to adjust your financial goals, such as saving for a summer vacation or saving $1,000 per month. Consider smaller or more attainable goals, like a road trip instead of a vacation that will require an expensive flight. Or, consider a $500 savings goal per month, which may be more reasonable to meet. It can be difficult to save during an uncertain economy, and it may take longer to reach certain goals, but every step brings you closer to where you want to be.\nTake these 10 steps now after the Fed's latest interest rate hike\nHow much is higher inflation hurting you?

    "summary": "Under Georgia law, police can seize your property without ever having to prove you did anything wrong in a court of law. But they do have to provide a public record of what they take.\nChannel 2 Action News Investigates found a local police department has not been doing that, which Channel 2 consumer investigator Justin Gray learned is a violation of Georgia law.\n'I work hard for that money to purchase that van, and I still do not have a van to this day,' said Tatiana Strong.\nThree years ago, South Fulton Police seized Strong's cargo van.\n'There was no court case. There was no charges. There was nothing, but it's gone,' Strong said.\nShe told Channel 2 Action News that she used the van for her medical supply delivery business.\nPolice claimed in a forfeiture complaint that the van was actually being used by an acquaintance of hers to transport drugs.\n[HAVE A STORY FOR 2 INVESTIGATES? Submit your story idea here]\nBut while there has never been a criminal conviction or even criminal charge related to the van, police never returned it.\nThat is how civil forfeiture can work legally.\n'There is no requirement that criminal charges be brought and there is no requirement that someone be convicted of a crime,' said Dan Alban, senior attorney with Institute for Justice, a legal non-profit.\n'We will never feel comfortable driving this car,' said Karla Hill, whose Dodge Charger was seized along with two other cars.\nCity of South Fulton police charged Hill with operating a chop shop.\n'Were you operating a chop shop?' Gray asked.\n'No, we were not operating a chop shop,' Hill said.\nShe filed numerous complaints with the city of South Fulton and Fulton County about the seizures and a judge ordered South Fulton police to return the Charger.\n\n\nRealty group's 40-year listing agreements causing pain even after death, loved ones say\n\n\nBut the other two cars appear gone for good even before the case has ever gone to trial, and with no court records authorizing the seizures.\n'The cars are absolutely gone. The cars have been sold,' Hill said.\nCritics said there is an incentive for police to do this.\n'In Georgia and many other states, law enforcement gets to keep up to 100% of the proceeds of what they seize and forfeit,' Alban said.\nGeorgia law enforcement agencies seized more than $51 million in cash and property between 2015 and 2018, according to the Institute for Justice.\nOne of the legal protections that Georgia law requires is that police departments report what they've seized each year to the state and publish it online for all to see.\nBut Channel 2 Action News found that South Fulton Police never did that.\nIn fact, when Channel 2 Action News filed a Georgia open records request for the missing data, the city South Fulton Police Department denied it.\nThe Institute for Justice sued and won a decade ago against other Georgia police departments for violating this same transparency law.\n'That's the bare minimum that you can expect is to ask law enforcement to tell the citizens and the legislature what it is that it's doing,' Alban said.\n'I actually want to thank you all for bringing that to our attention,' said South Fulton Chief Keith Meadows.\nMeadows told Gray he did not realize South Fulton was breaking Georgia law until Gray told him.\n'Do you think asset forfeiture is an area that's ripe for potential abuse?' Gray asked Meadows.\n'I do. And that's why I think the transparency piece that you mentioned is so important,' Meadows said.\n'Do you think it's something where you all have made mistakes?' Gray asked.\n'It is. That is an area where we have made some mistakes,' Meadows said.\nAn outside investigation released in the fall of 2022 substantiated a long list of complaints of alleged wrongdoing by the person who headed up the asset forfeiture program, former South Fulton Police Lt. Shannon McKesey.\nShe resigned in lieu of termination.\nMeadows told Gray he hired McKesey specifically for her previous experience with civil forfeiture at the Atlanta Police Department.\n'Do you regret putting that trust in her?' Gray asked Meadows.\n'I do. Now, the person that I've seen right now is not the person that I knew,' Meadows said.\nThat is why Meadows said he called the Georgia Bureau of Investigation in to investigate.\n'Are you going back through these case by case to see if other people who had their assets seized, something might have gone wrong?' Gray asked Meadows.\n'Well, that's what we're asking the GBI to do. What I want right now is for full transparency. I want there to be an independent view of each one of those files,' Meadows said.\nThat is every case, including Hill's and Strong's.\n'I lost a way to feed my family, to feed my husband, to feed my kids. I'm trying not to cry but it's so upsetting,' Strong said.\nMeadows gave Gray a list of asset forfeiture totals and told him they have now uploaded the information as required by law to the state. It's about $400,000 in cash seized and more than 50 vehicles seized since 2018.\nIf police use civil forfeiture on your property, there is not much you can do besides hiring an attorney or reaching out to a legal non-profit for help.\nIN OTHER NEWS:",

    "summary": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 9, 2023 / This National Entrepreneurship Week, SkysTheLimit.org is proud to recognize three founders - from its community of over 45,000 entrepreneurs from historically marginalized and underrepresented groups - who are pushing the boundaries to transform lives for the better.\nThis National Entrepreneurship Week, Sky's the Limit is pleased to celebrate the achievements of:\nVictor Sandifer, based in Atlanta, GA, is Founder of Run The World Clothing. His business provides quality, stylish, cut, and sew apparel that also has a powerful message of consciousness: anyone who gives back to the world with their passion is running the world.\nVictor has a passion for educating and empowering his community and has created Run The World Clothing as a vessel to educate, inspire, and empower like-minded individuals to use their own passion to help others. In addition, his apparel company prides itself on its community engagement and service. The organization hosts free events that bring people together to have fun, and an annual charity basketball tournament.\n\"I was born and raised in Oakland. Growing up I did not see many businesses in my community owned by people that looked like me. Consequently, I did not think entrepreneurship was an option for me. Not until I got into the workforce and figured that working a conventional job was not for me. Entrepreneurship has given me true freedom and has made everyday for me purposeful. I decided to join SkysTheLimit.org because I know how important it is to have like-minded people in your circle help you become successful. Having mentors has helped me see my business from a different perspective. Good mentors have always shared with me their honest opinions and have helped me grow and build a stronger business. Also, having mentors and other entrepreneurs on my side has helped me build a stronger network,\" said Victor.\nRead more about Victor here.\nAlain Justilien, based in Walnut Creek, CA, is Founder, CEO, and Owner of Justilien Home Stays, a mid-term rental agency that provides housing for traveling professionals who are looking to stay in comfortable, curated accommodation for a month or longer and have found that other existing options don't always meet their unique needs.\n\"My background is in sales, and I've always been a go-getter, ever since college. I have joined Sky's the Limit because I believe that only entrepreneurs can achieve true financial freedom. Through reading books such as Think and Grow Rich, and listening to guys like Timothy Ferris, Grant Cardone, Brian Tracy, and many others, I realized that I've always been an entrepreneur at heart. I've joined this community to link with other like-minded individuals who have a dream to be financially liberated and also have someone to hold me accountable. I am motivated day-to-day to keep working on my business knowing that I have a family to live for (new baby girl included) and to impact my generation for people who need to see an example of someone who's done the work and is becoming successful,\" said Alain.\nRead more about Alain here.\nTiffany Nelson, based in Tulsa, Oklahoma, is Founder of Imagiread - an organization supporting children and their community with culturally responsive literacy development instruction. Birthed from a love of children's literature and family learning engagement, Tiffany started Imagiread in 2010, shortly after the writing and self-publishing of her first title, It's Water Time, Ma, a popular S.T.E.M. reference with school-aged children, parents, and educators. It eventually caught the attention of the Executive Director at an educational organization who wanted to collaborate to create a S.T.R.E.A.M-based literacy development curriculum. Her research uncovered the need for programs that empower, inspire, and offer a progressive continuum in order to be representative and responsive to cultural diversity and inclusion, and facilitated ethically and with integrity.\n\"I'm a Cultural Communications Consultant who is extremely passionate about creating and facilitating 21st Century culturally responsive literacy development instruction that reinforces mindful learning in safe environments. Literacy development is the key to conscious and active learning. As a foundation, every child is capable of being a strong reader when they are accepted, acknowledged, and supported. With over a decade of experience and proof of concept, I'm ready to ethically digitize Imagiread's system so that we can reach 1 million children. Sky's the Limit has been incredible. Once I joined, not only was I fortunate enough to have one mentor, but I had two! They are both dynamic IT professionals that helped me to restructure Imagiread's programming so that it's ready for web-based applications integration and launch,\" said Tiffany.\nRead more about Tiffany here.\nAs we honor National Entrepreneurship Week, these founders are defining purpose-led entrepreneurship for this century and offering inspiration, hope, and wisdom for future generations.\nSky's the Limit offers opportunities for entrepreneurs from traditionally marginalized entrepreneurs - typically those who identify as LGBTQI+, BIPOC, women, veterans, disabled people, and people from low-income backgrounds - to connect with mentors to come together to foster, grow, and shape modern and future enterprise.\nFor more information about how to get your company involved in mentoring, please visit https://www.skysthelimit.org/partnerships.\n# # #\nAbout SkysThelimit.org: SkysTheLimit.org is a digital platform that connects young, historically excluded entrepreneurs with one-on-one support from experienced business advisors and mentors, entrepreneurship milestone training and tracking, and community-voted startup grants.

    "title": "Did steep U.S. tariffs on Russian plywood actually cut imports? Maybe",

    "excerpt": "A study by environmental group EarthSight found that while tariffs helped cut U.S. imports of plywood from Russia in half, Russia remains the nation's second-largest foreign plywood supplier.",
    "summary": "When Russia invaded Ukraine, the United States imposed sanctions and tariffs designed to slow the Russian economy \u2014 including steeper tariffs on lumber from the nation's vast and lucrative timber industry.\nBut a study released Thursday by the environmental group EarthSight found that while tariffs helped cut U.S. imports of plywood from Russia in half from 2021 to 2022, outpacing an overall decline in plywood imports from all nations of 18 percent, Russia remains the second-largest foreign supplier of plywood to the U.S. The U.S. directly imported at least $1.2 billion worth from Russia in 2022.\nPlywood remains one of the largest sectors of shipments of goods other than gas and oil coming directly from Russia and its ally Belarus into the U.S., accounting for roughly half of all Russian consumer goods landing on American shores from November 2022 to January, according to an analysis of Russian export and U.S. import records by EarthSight.\nAfter Russia launched its invasion in February 2022, the U.S. placed a hefty 50 percent tax on Russian and Belarusian plywood. The European Union and United Kingdom banned Russian wood products altogether.\n'It's a scandal,' said Sam Lawson, director of London-based EarthSight. 'I think most U.S. consumers will be shocked.'\nLawson said that 'U.S. consumers are under the impression that the U.S. is doing everything it can to isolate Russia economically. The reality is that there are still large areas of improvement available for great sanctions. And this is one of the most important ones.'\nEarthSight called for the U.S. to follow the E.U. and the U.K. and ban Russian timber imports, and to sanction a Russian oligarch who owns a large stake in an exporting lumber mill.\nEarthSight also raised concerns about whether timber is being felled from vast forests owned by the Russian military, so that plywood sales indirectly benefit its armed forces. The forests, including one in Irkutsk, have produced more than 1 million cubic meters of timber in a year. Since the war's start, independent inspectors have left Russia, making it more difficult to know where the wood goes.\nYehor Hrynyk, a Kyiv-based forest conservationist with the Ukrainian Nature Conservation Group, said, 'When you buy something from Russia nowadays, you are basically supporting the Russian war machine.' He counts several of his colleagues among the war dead.\nPlywood imported from Russia and Belarus is typically higher-grade, often made from Baltic or Russian birch, and used mostly in construction and furniture.\nThe largest single U.S. importer of Russian plywood identified by EarthSight is PG Wood Imports based in suburban Atlanta, which imported a third of the Russian timber products arriving at U.S. ports during the past six months, averaging three shipping containers a day.\nCompany officials did not respond to requests for comment. NBC News confirmed that at least 100 plywood shipments to PG Wood Imports came directly from Russia, according to import data from Panjiva, a supply chain research group.\nOne of PG Woods Russian suppliers is Vyatsky Plywood, a subsidiary of Segezha Group, which is mostly owned by the Moscow-based conglomerate Sistema Group. Sistema was founded three decades ago by Vladimir Yevtushenkov, with stakes in telecommunications, hotels, online retail and pharmaceutical concerns.\nYevtushenkov is close enough to the regime that he was among the inner circle of 37 oligarchs who met with Putin in the Kremlin on Feb. 24, the day Russia invaded Ukraine. In April, he was personally sanctioned by the U.K.\u00a0 The U.S. has not sanctioned either Yevtushenkov or his companies.\nVyatsky Plywood was among the largest plywood suppliers from Russia to the U.S. in recent months, with shipments topping 1,200 cubic meters a month, according to EarthSight's analysis of Russian export and U.S. import records.\nLawson called for further sanctions on Yevtushenkov and his companies. 'The flow of money to him needs to stop,' Lawson said.\nYevtushenkov did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThe U.S. Commerce Department did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nWhile direct shipments from Russia continue into the U.S., some products made from Russian timber are shipped indirectly and avoid higher import tariffs.\nIn September, another U.K. environmental group, Environmental Investigation Agency, found some Russian birch was sent through Vietnam and China before getting shipped to the U.S. Since it was no longer labeled Russian birch, it was not subject to steep U.S. tariffs.\nOne country that increased its plywood exports to the U.S. in 2022, according to EarthSight's analysis, was Turkey, which neighbors Russia on land and on the Black Sea.\nHrynyk, who also tracks Russian timber exports, said he has seen Russian birch plywood routed through Kazakhstan to evade European Union sanctions.\nBut, Lawson said, 'the biggest problem is direct shipments to the U.S.'\nIn July, Pavel Chashchin, head of Russia's Federal Forest Management Agency, told the Russian news service Tass that Russia would not 'suffer much' from sanctions because of strong demand, particularly from Asia.\u00a0Among the U.S. companies that continued trade with Russia, according to SEC filings, is International Paper Co., based in Memphis, Tennessee, the world's largest pulp and paper maker. Since 2007, it has operated Ilim Group, a joint venture half owned with Russian partners, that ranked among Russia's largest pulp and paper businesses. It was a lucrative part of International Paper.\nInternational sanctions were affecting the company, International Paper told shareholders last year. The company said it was looking at selling its half of the company. International Paper announced in January it is selling its stake to its Russian partners for $508 million. A date for the sale has not been announced, and is pending regulatory approval in Russia.\nInternational Paper told NBC News it is working to end its involvement in the joint venture as soon as it can.\nThis article was originally published on NBCNews.com",

    "excerpt": "As former President Jimmy Carter receives home hospice care at the age of 98, misconceptions about his life are coming into focus as well. MISCONCEPTION: Ronald Reagan freed the American hostages in\u2026",
    "summary": "PLAINS, Ga. (AP) \u2014 Exaggeration, misinformation and myth have always infected politics \u2013 even before social media took it to the extreme.\nMisconceptions take especially strong hold where U.S. presidents are concerned: sometimes their advantage, sometimes not. Some claims relate to policy, others to their biographies and personal traits.\nThat George Washington story about the cherry tree? Apocryphal. And his teeth weren't actually made of wood. (At least some of his 'false teeth' were taken from the mouths of enslaved persons.) There's no evidence that William Howard Taft ever got stuck in a bathtub. (He was the heaviest president on record, though, at more than 300 pounds.)\nJames Monroe wasn't the principal force behind the Monroe Doctrine. (That would be his secretary of state and future president John Quincy Adams.) And Richard Nixon wasn't actually impeached. (He resigned before the full House could vote on the matter.)\nAs former President Jimmy Carter receives home hospice care at the age of 98, misconceptions about his life are coming into focus as well. Most are rooted in some truth but need more context:\nMISCONCEPTION: Ronald Reagan freed the American hostages in Iran.\nMORE ACCURATE: Carter and his administration negotiated their release, but Tehran wouldn't free them until after Reagan's inauguration on Jan. 20, 1981.\nTHE DETAILS: Iranian revolutionaries stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979. They would hold 52 U.S. citizens for 444 days. From the outset, Carter resolved not to start a shooting war in response. He authorized a rescue mission in the spring of 1980, but mechanical problems forced the helicopter operation to abort and one crashed, killing eight servicemen.\nCarter, a Democrat, continued diplomatic efforts but suffered politically amid intense news coverage of the crisis. He lost in a Nov. 4 landslide to the Republican Reagan. A final round of negotiations began in Algeria after. The U.S. delegation was led by Deputy Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Iradays n and the U.S. finalized terms for the hostages' release on Carter's final full day in office, Jan. 19, 1981, and Carter remained in the Oval Office the next morning, Inauguration Day, seeing through details. They were released shortly after Reagan was sworn in. Reagan then sent Carter to West Germany to greet the freed Americans.\nMISCONCEPTION: Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded Habitat for Humanity.\nMORE ACCURATE: The Carters have been Habitat's most famous endorsers and volunteers. But the organization was established by wealthy businessman Millard Fuller and his wife, Linda, as an outgrowth a Georgia commune where the spent time in the 1960s.\nTHE DETAILS: Habitat grew out of the housing ministry of Koinonia Farm, a multiracial commune in Carter's home county that was ostracized in the days of Jim Crow segregation. In 1965, Fuller came to the farm for what he'd later describe as spiritual renewal.\nCarter biographer Jonathan Alter details that Martin Luther King Jr. befriended Koinonia's white founder, Clarence Jordan, during the civil rights movement. But the non-profit organization was accused in Georgia courts of being a communist front, and King's inner circle considered it radical. Jordan was beaten on the streets of Americus, a short distance from Plains. Against this backdrop, Alter writes, Jimmy Carter kept his distance. Jordan's nephew, Hamilton Jordan, would become Carter's White House chief of staff. Alter records the younger Jordan, who died in 2008, saying his uncle viewed Carter as 'just a politician.'\nKoinonia's local housing programs were formalized as the 'Fund for Humanity' in the late 1960s. Carter was running for governor then. The Fullers established Habitat for Humanity in 1976, the year Carter won the presidency. The Carters' first volunteer Habitat build was in New York City in 1984. That became the annual Jimmy & Rosalynn Carter Work Project, which would eventually build, renovate or repair 4,400 homes in 14 countries. The Carters worked alongside more than 104,000 volunteers, by The Carter Center's count.\nMISCONEPTION: Jimmy Carter was an unabashed liberal.\nMORE ACCURATE: Carter was a moderate politician, campaigned deliberately and, once in office, pursued policies that don't fit easily under one label.\nTHE DETAILS: Carter sought the presidency in 1976 as an outsider in a party largely controlled in Washington by New Deal liberals and Kennedy loyalists. Carter was a 'Southern Democrat' who never gelled with Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy, who challenged him in a damaging 1980 primary. Carter had described himself in Georgia as both 'conservative' and 'progressive,' depending on the issue, the audience and the campaign. Sometimes he even used those words together.\nHe was a good-government policy wonk who spent considerable political capital reorganizing government in Atlanta and then Washington. He pushed windfall taxes on big oil (unsuccessfully) but frustrated fellow Democrats on spending priorities and added little to the national debt compared to all his successors (less than $300 billion in four years). The deregulatory era often associated with Reagan actually began with Carter loosening regulations on airlines, trains and trucking.\nCarter advocated for a national health program but his top health care bill failed because it didn't go far enough for party liberals, including Kennedy. Carter grew more openly progressive as a former president, voting for Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential primaries. But he also warned his party ahead of 2020 not to move too far left if they hoped to defeat then-President Donald Trump.\nMISCONCEPTION: Jimmy Carter is married to 'RAHZ-lyn,' and he was there when she was born.\nMORE ACCURATE: It's 'ROSE-lyn,' and he met her as a newborn \u2013 but not immediately.\nTHE DETAILS: Eleanor Rosalynn (again, 'ROSE-lyn') Smith was born in Plains on Aug. 18, 1927. The nurse who delivered her was Lillian Carter, the future president's mother. But Jimmy Carter, who was born Oct. 1, 1924, was back on the family farm in nearby Archery, outside Plains. 'Miss Lillian' brought her her son back to the Smiths' house a few days later to see baby Rosalynn, who is now 95.\nAs for the pronunciation, remember the flower. The former president's affectionate name for her might help, too. He often calls her 'Rosie.'",

    "summary": "Multiple reports over the weekend indicated former President Donald Trump could be indicted soon by a grand jury in New York. Then Monday, news surfaced of an Atlanta, Georgia, district attorney who is reportedly preparing to file charges as well against Trump.\nTrump has already launched his campaign to become president in 2024, which leads to a question: If Trump is indicted and then found guilty, can he still run for president in 2024?\nThe short answer is yes.\nHere's why:\nThe Constitution sets out the requirements for an individual to run for president in Article II, Section I.\n'No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.'\nCitizenship, age, and residency are all constitutional requirements to run for president, but a clean criminal record is not.\n\nDonald Trump announces he's running for president\nHere's what Donald Trump said he will do if he doesn't win the 2024 GOP presidential nomination\nThere is some precedent of individuals running for president with a criminal record. In 1920, Eugene V. Debs ran for president from prison after unlawfully protesting the draft in World War I. His campaign buttons read 'Prisoner 9653,' and he was unsuccessful although he garnered nearly a million votes.\nAnd currently, Joe Exotic, made famous in the Netflix docuseries 'Tiger King,' is running for president as a libertarian while in prison. He is serving a 21 year sentence for murder-for-hire.\nThe possible New York charges involve Trump's payments to Stormy Daniels in 2016 through his then-attorney that were allegedly recorded as a legal fee rather than a business record, which is a misdemeanor. He could also be charged with a federal campaign finance disclosure failure and cover-up, which is a felony.\nThe Georgia special purpose grand jury is considering if the former president should be indicted for a felony for his efforts to subvert the 2020 presidential election results in the Peach State.\nTrump asked his followers last week to 'protest' if he is arrested. He predicted on Truth Social that could happen as soon as Tuesday.\nTrump has characterized the possible charges as politically motivated and an abuse of power by elected prosecutors. Similar to the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago, Florida, home for classified documents last August, it's possible the arrest could boost his campaign.\nTrump even said so.\nEarlier this month, he told The Associated Press an indictment wouldn't discourage his presidential ambitions.\nReporters asked him if he'd continue his campaign if he was charged of a crime. 'Oh, absolutely, I won't even think about leaving,' he said, adding that 'probably, it'll enhance my numbers, but it's a very bad thing for America. It's very bad for the country.'\nA boost of his campaign appears possible.\nElon Musk also predicted Saturday that Trump's arrest would result in a 'landslide victory' for him.\nNot only could rank-and-file Republicans rally to Trump's defense, but congressional leaders are already doing just that.\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said Saturday he would call a congressional investigation into Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg if he indicts Trump. He referred to the potential prosecution as 'an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA who lets violent criminals walk as he pursues political vengeance against President Trump.'\nThen Monday, three GOP leaders \u2014 House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, House Oversight Chairman James Comer and House Administration Chairman Bryan Steil \u2014 sent a joint letter requesting that Bragg testify in front of Congress.\n'Your decision to pursue such a politically motivated prosecution ... requires congressional scrutiny about how public safety funds appropriated by Congress are implemented by local law-enforcement agencies,' the chairmen said in the letter.\nThe scope of the congressional inquiry would be confined to determining if any federal public safety funds were used as part of the grand jury investigation.\nMcCarthy asked Trump supporters not to protest if he is arrested. 'I don't think people should protest this, no,' he said a press conference at the House Republican annual retreat in Orlando, Florida.\nAlso speaking out against protests was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga. She tweeted Saturday that there is no need to protest since she believes an indictment of Trump would 'seal' Democrats' fate in 2024.\nOther potential Republican presidential candidates have spoken against a possible Trump arrest.\nFormer Vice President Mike Pence, a possible 2024 presidential candidate, told Breitbart the possible indictment reminds him of his time in the Trump administration. 'It reeks of the kind of political prosecution that we endured back in the days of the Russia hoax and the whole impeachment over a phone call.'\nEntrepreneur and declared GOP presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy also denounced the possible Trump indictments.\n'It is un-American for the ruling party to use police power to arrest its political rivals,' Ramaswamy said. 'If a Republican prosecutor in 2004 had used a campaign finance technicality to arrest then-candidate John Kerry while Bush and Cheney were in power, liberals would have cried foul \u2014 and rightly so.'\nGov. Ron DeSantis of Florida, who is a leading Republican contender against Trump, gave a more nuanced answer, criticizing the Manhattan district attorney but also appearing to mock Trump for his moral choices.\n'I don't know what goes into paying hush many to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair,' DeSantis said to scattered laughter at a press conference on Monday.\n'I have no interest in getting involved in some type of manufactured circus by some Soros DA,' DeSantis said, referring to billionaire George Soros, a top Democratic donor. 'We've got so may things pending in front of the (Florida) legislature. I've got to spend my time on issues that actually matter to people. I can't spend my time worrying about things of that nature,' he added.",

    "excerpt": "Spring seemed to come early in much of the United States this year, and nearly everyone with seasonal allergies noticed.",
    "summary": "Spring seemed to come early in much of the United States this year, and nearly everyone with seasonal allergies noticed. As climate change causes winters to be warmer and plants begin blooming earlier, studies have shown that the pollen that causes allergy symptoms has been arriving earlier than in past decades.\nHere's a breakdown of how warmer winters are leading to a longer plant-growing season and how it's affecting millions of Americans with hay fever.\n'February continued the unusually mild start to 2023, with much of the eastern U.S. seeing record or near-record warm temperatures,' according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).\n'The average temperature across the contiguous U.S. last month was 36.5 degrees F, 2.7 degrees above the 20th-century average, ranking in the warmest third of the 129-year climate record,' the agency said in a report released last week.\nVirginia had its warmest February on record. Eight other states east of the Mississippi River had their second-warmest February ever, and three had their third-warmest.\nHowever, there was an exception: Six western states \u2014 Arizona, California, Colorado, Idaho, Nevada, and Oregon \u2014 experienced colder-than-normal February temperatures this year.\nAlthough there is still another week of winter on the astronomical calendar, which is based on the Earth's position in relation to the Sun, 'meteorological winter' refers to the coldest three months of the year, and it is considered December-February.\nNOAA reported last week that the meteorological winter's average temperature was 2.7 degrees warmer than the 20th Century average, making it the 17th warmest meteorological winter on record. Massachusetts had its warmest winter ever, and seven states in the Northeast, Appalachia and the Upper Midwest had their second-warmest winter on-record. Another 21 states had one of their 10 warmest winters.\nTotal average winter precipitation for the December-February meteorological winter of 2022-2023 has so far been 0.90 of an inch above the historical average. Wisconsin had its wettest winter ever, and another six states had one of their 10 wettest winters. Studies have found that more rain during a plant's growing season leads to earlier and faster growth.\n'Observers are reporting very early leaf outs of the common lilac in Pennsylvania, the brilliant yellow blossoms of forsythia in Maine and American witch hazel in New York,' USA Today reported late last week. A study of records from over 140 years at the Missouri Botanical Garden found that violets are responding to increased rainfall and higher temperatures by budding earlier, the newspaper reported.\n'I'm sitting outside on March 7 and all my daffodils are blooming, and it's ridiculous,' Lois Krauss, a local environmental activist in Westfield, N.J., told Yahoo News.\nThe National Phenology Network, which tracks the arrival of spring by following the blooming of plant species that are common nationwide and typically among the first to sprout leaves, such as honeysuckles and lilacs, reported in late February that leaves were sprouting the earliest they ever had in parts of the eastern U.S. In New York City, buds appeared 32 days before the historical average.\n'Spring leaf out continues to spread north, arriving several days to weeks earlier than average (the period of 1991-2020) in much of the Southeast, lower Midwest, and mid-Atlantic. Kansas City, MO is 9 days early, Nantucket, MA is 35 days early,' the National Phenology Network reported on Monday. The group added that 'spring bloom has also arrived in southern states, days to weeks early in the Southeast,' including 22 days early in Norfolk, Va.\n'It's a little unsettling, it's certainly something that is out of the bounds of when we'd normally expect spring,' Teresa Crimmins, the National Phenology Network's director and an environmental scientist at the University of Arizona, told the Guardian, regarding the early blooms. 'It perhaps isn't surprising, given the trajectory our planet is on, but it is surprising when you live through it.'\nHowever, this is not uniformly true nationwide. 'The West is a mix of early and late,' the group noted. 'Southwest UT is days to over a week late and Portland, OR is 2 days late\u2026 Spring bloom is 10 days late in Las Vegas, NV.'\nA new report from Climate Central, a climate research nonprofit, analyzed temperature data for 203 U.S. cities since 1970, to measure the length of the plant-growing season \u2014 the stretch between the last freeze in or before spring and the first of the following fall or winter. The group found 85% of the cities have longer growing seasons than they did in 1970. On average, the freeze-free season grew the most in the West, 27 days, followed by the Southeast (16 days), Northeast (15 days), South (14 days), and Central U.S. (13 days).\n'Because of climate change, we're now seeing an earlier and longer growing season for plants, which of course make pollen, which is the enemy of many Americans that suffer from pollen allergies \u2013 and mold allergies as well,' Lauren Casey, a meteorologist with Climate Central, told CNN. 'Pollen can also trigger an asthma attack, which of course is much more serious for people that suffer from asthma.'\nAlthough weather will always vary from year to year, temperatures have been consistently rising, by an average of 0.14 degrees Fahrenheit since 1880, due to climate change, according to the federal government. Average global temperatures have risen 2 degrees Fahrenheit since the Industrial Revolution, as a result of increased concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n'Winter is getting warmer,' Matthew Barlow, a professor of climate science at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, told Yahoo News. As a result, the duration of cold weather is getting shorter on both ends.\nClimate change is also leading to more precipitation. 'As average temperatures at the Earth's surface rise more evaporation occurs, which, in turn, increases overall precipitation,' the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) explains. 'Therefore, a warming climate is expected to increase precipitation in many areas. Since the beginning of the 20th Century, precipitation in the contiguous 48 states has increased at an average rate of 0.20 inches per decade, according to the EPA.\nIt's not just climate change contributing to the early sprouting. The carbon dioxide emissions that cause climate change also spur earlier and faster plant growth. Since plants take in carbon dioxide when performing photosynthesis, higher atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide rev up that process.\n'Carbon dioxide (CO2), in addition to being the principal global warming gas, can also be thought of as plant food \u2014 it's the source of carbon needed to make sugars during photosynthesis,' explained a 2016 research paper in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives. 'When exposed to warmer temperatures and higher levels of CO2, plants grow more vigorously and produce more pollen than they otherwise would.'\nSeasonal allergies, also known as 'hay fever,' are caused by allergic reactions to plant pollen and mold spores in the air. As higher concentrations of CO2, higher temperatures and heavier precipitation contribute to earlier and faster plant growth, allergy season is extended and exacerbated.\nFor example, Atlanta 'saw pollen counts rise to \u2018extremely high' levels on March 6, the earliest in 30 years,' Forbes recently reported.\nThe Washington Post reported in mid-February that 'unusually high winter temperatures have resulted in a historically early and intense tree pollen explosion,' in the nation's capital. D.C.'s first high tree pollen count came on Feb. 8, marking the third-earliest recorded high pollen count, and the third such occurrence since 2017.\nA number of studies in recent years have identified longer and more intense pollen seasons as a consequence of climate change.\nQA 2021 paper published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences between 1990 and 2018 from 60 pollen count stations across the United States and Canada, found a 21% increase in pollen concentrations and a 10-day longer annual average pollen season over the course of the 38-year period.\n'Trend data suggest that the prevalence of asthma, including forms of the disease triggered by pollen, mold, and other allergenic substances, is on the rise,' a 2016 paper in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives reported.\nFor many, allergies are just a minor nuisance, but for asthma sufferers it can be deadly, as allergies are a major cause of asthma attacks.\nEighty-one million Americans, including roughly 26% of adults and 19% of children, had an asthma diagnosis as of 2021, according to the Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America.\nAlthough some treatments for allergies exist, including antihistamine medications and allergy shots, none are 100% effective and some are quite expensive or time-intensive. Ultimately, environmental and public health advocacy organizations argue for reducing greenhouse gas emissions to limit the severity of climate change.\n\"We're already experiencing the effects of climate change with every breath we take in the spring,\" William Anderegg, an associate professor of biology at the University of Utah, told NPR last year. \"Acting on climate change really does matter for people's health.\"",

In 2018, the companies announced a collaboration to establish a delivery network that combines artificial intelligence, advanced robotics and automation in a bold new way, bringing first-of-its-kind technology to America.\nThe delivery network relies on highly automated fulfillment centers. At the hub sites, more than 1,000 bots move around giant 3D grids, orchestrated by proprietary control systems. The grid, known as The Hive, contains totes filled with products and ready-to-deliver customer orders. As customers' orders near delivery times, bots retrieve products from The Hive and present them at pick stations for items to be sorted for delivery, a process governed by algorithms that ensure items are intelligently packed. For example, fragile items are placed on top, bags are evenly weighted, and each order is optimized to fit into the lowest number of bags, reducing plastic use. Bags are also recyclable, reflecting Kroger's commitment to its Zero Hunger | Zero Waste commitment to rid its communities of hunger and waste.\nKroger's end-to-end cold solutions keep groceries fresh once loaded into a customized refrigerated delivery van, which can store up to 20 orders. Powerful machine learning algorithms optimize delivery routes, considering factors such as road conditions and optimal fuel efficiency. Vans may travel up to 90 minutes with orders from the hub and spoke facilities to make deliveries. Associates at the spoke facility will deliver orders within their service area, adding ZIP codes as demand grows.\nKroger currently operates customer fulfillment centers in Monroe, OH, Groveland, FL, Forest Park, GA (Atlanta), Pleasant Prairie, WI, Dallas, TX, Romulus, MI (Detroit) and Aurora, CO with additional customer fulfillment centers slated for California, Frederick, MD, Phoenix, AZ, Cleveland, OH, Charlotte, NC, as well as South Florida and the Northeast.\n*Customers in Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa can order fresh groceries for delivery at Kroger.com or on the Kroger app, set up a Kroger loyalty account, and earn points to save on fuel at participating Shell stations.\nMedia AssetsTo download Kroger Delivery photography and video, visit here.\nAbout KrogerAt The Kroger Co.

    "excerpt": "Just 40% of U.S. adults approve of how President Joe Biden is handling relations with China, a new poll shows, with a majority anxious about Beijing's influence as the White House finds its agenda\u2026",
    "summary": "WASHINGTON (AP) \u2014 Just 40% of U.S. adults approve of how President Joe Biden is handling relations with China, a new poll shows, with a majority anxious about Beijing's influence as the White House finds its agenda increasingly shaped by global rivalries.\nAbout 6 in 10 say they are gravely concerned about China, the world's second-largest economy after the United States, according to the survey by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Biden has portrayed his domestic agenda on infrastructure and computer chip development as part of a broader competition with China, arguing that the future is at stake.\nTensions with China are crackling after government officials discovered and shot down a Chinese spy balloon two weeks ago. The Biden administration has preserved tariffs on imports from China and restricted the sale of advanced computer chips to the country, angering Chinese officials who want to fuel faster economic growth.\nThere are additional concerns over whether China will provide some form of military support for Russia's war in Ukraine. As the war nears its one-year mark, the poll shows that serious concern about the threat Russia poses to the U.S. has fallen. Concern about China now outpaces that about Russia; last year, about even percentages had named the two countries as a threat.\nBiden has tried to frame relations with China as a competition with boundaries, rather than as a larger geopolitical clash.\n'We seek competition, not conflict, with China,' Biden said last week. ' We're not looking for a new Cold War. ... We'll responsibly manage that competition so that it doesn't veer into conflict.'\nApproval of Biden's foreign policy is roughly in line with views of his presidency more broadly, a possible sign that his agenda is not viewed through its individual components but larger perceptions of the president himself.\nThe poll found that 45% of U.S. adults say they approve of Biden's overall performance, while 54% disapprove. That's similar to views of Biden in recent months. Forty-one percent praised the president in late January and 43% did in December.\nConcern about China's global influence as a threat to the U.S. is similar to last year but has grown steadily in recent years from 54% just after Biden took office and 48% in January 2020.\nMelvin Dunlap, 68, said Biden needed to be careful with China, given the U.S. reliance on Chinese manufacturing. The Peyton, Colorado, resident said he believes Biden 'has a good heart' and 'means well,' generally approving of Biden's approach.\n'You tread cautiously,' said Dunlap, who retired from law enforcement. 'You show strength, not weakness.'\nFewer adults feel as wary about Russia as they did just after its military invaded Ukraine last year. Now, 53% say they're seriously concerned about Russia, down from 64% in March 2022.\nMichael Marchek, 33, an engineer in the Atlanta area, said Russia's military has struggled in Ukraine, failing to achieve its goal of taking the capital of Kyiv and sustaining steep casualties that showed a sense of disarray.\n'I was more concerned about Russia before they proved they were less effective than they appeared to be on the surface,\" Marchek said. 'They played their hand and they did not play their hand effectively. They have nuclear capabilities and other things, but I don't think they're interested in using them.'\nBiden made a surprise visit to Kyiv on Monday, declaring to that country's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, 'You remind us that freedom is priceless; it's worth fighting for for as long as it takes. And that's how long we're going to be with you, Mr. President, for as long as it takes.'\nTo Ukraine's defense, the U.S. has committed tanks, armored vehicles, a thousand artillery systems, more than 2 million rounds of artillery ammunition and more than 50 advanced launch rocket systems, and anti-ship and air defense systems.\nWhile Biden views the preservation of NATO and countering Russian aggression as necessary, most U.S. adults say it should not come at the expense of their economy. Oil, natural gas and food prices initially worsened after Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into Ukraine last February, causing U.S. inflation to hit a 40-year high in June. Inflation has since eased, and the U.S. and much of Europe have so far evaded recessions despite the expected damage. Russia has adapted to financial sanctions and export controls designed to erode its ability to fund the war.\nYet in a late January AP-NORC poll, a majority of U.S. adults \u2013 59% -- said limiting damage to the American economy is more important than penalizing Russia, even if that means sanctions are less effective. The balance of opinion had been the reverse in the early months after the invasion.\nThe U.S. economy remains a sensitive subject for Biden. People are generally unimpressed by the 3.4% unemployment rate. Nor has a seven-month decline in inflation \u2014 which is still running high \u2014 done much to assuage fears.\nWhile economists have yet to declare a recession, respondents to the survey feel as though the economy is mired in a downturn.\nOverall, the new poll shows 32% say the economy is in good shape. That's a slight improvement from 24% in January, which was consistent with views late last year. Still, 68% say the economy is in bad shape, and approval of Biden's job handling the economy has remained negative. Only 36% say they approve of the president on the economy, similar to last month and late last year.\n'It's basically the inflation that we're all worried about,' said Adriana Stan, 36, a teacher in Columbia, South Carolina.\nStan bought a house in December at a 5.5% mortgage rate, more than double the rate during the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Reserve has increased its own benchmark interest rates in order to push down inflation, a move that has also driven up borrowing costs for homebuyers. Stan said her grocery bills are also much higher.\n'We buy the same stuff,\" Stan said. \"But at the end of the month I feel like I'm paying so much more.'\n___\nThe poll of 1,247 adults was conducted Feb. 16-20 using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

    "excerpt": "Republicans are increasingly looking to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to play a leading role in the party's bid to take back the White House in 2024 and beyond following his decisive victory in last\u2026",
    "summary": "Republicans are increasingly looking to Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp (R) to play a leading role in the party's bid to take back the White House in 2024 and beyond following his decisive victory in last year's midterm election.\nComing off a year that saw him easily shut down a primary challenge backed by former President Trump before routing Democrat Stacey Abrams in the general election, Kemp is having a political moment. Republicans downplay his interest in a presidential bid, but point to him as a potential running mate for the eventual nominee or, at the very least, a highly sought-after surrogate in a newly minted battleground state.\nMultiple Kemp allies also raised the possibility of a Senate bid in 2026, when Sen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) will be up for reelection.\n'After his accomplishment in the last election cycle, I think he has earned at a minimum elder statesman status,' said John Watson, a former Georgia GOP chairman and a close ally of Kemp. 'The well-known battles with the former president, obviously the general race that was his second go-around with Stacey Abrams. I mean, the guy has packed a lifetime of politics into four years.'\n'I think at a minimum, Republicans across the country ought to be picking up the phone and be talking to him.'\nFor the growing number of Republicans questioning Trump's continued influence in the GOP after three lackluster election cycles in a row, Kemp's success offers something of a blueprint for governing in a post-Trump party.\n'If you are a candidate for president, there is no single endorsement in Georgia that is of more importance than Brian Kemp,' Watson said. 'And because of that, I think that he's going to have a pretty high degree of interest from people seeking his counsel.'\nHe first won the governor's mansion in 2018 by campaigning as a staunch conservative Trump ally, before landing on the former president's target list when he pushed back against efforts to overturn President Biden's 2020 victory in Georgia. Trump coaxed former Sen. David Perdue (R) into an ill-fated primary bid against Kemp, who ultimately won renomination by more than 50 points.\nHe went on to defeat Abrams, a former state House minority leader and a national Democratic star, in a closely watched rematch in November, giving Georgia Republicans something to celebrate in a year that saw the GOP only barely recapture control of the House and blow an opportunity to oust Sen. Raphael Warnock (D) and win back the Senate majority.\nOn top of that, Kemp boasts a healthy approval rating. An\u00a0Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll\u00a0released last month showed Kemp with a 62-percent approval rating \u2014 the highest it's been in the poll since he took office in 2019.\n'I'm not sure there's anyone who's gotten more thrown at him in the last several years and come out of it stronger,' said one national Republican strategist. 'That appeal is a good rubric for those seeking office.'\nNow, as Republicans begin scoping out their next presidential nominee, many are looking to Kemp as something of a kingmaker in Georgia, believing that he may be the key to countering Trump and winning the state back for the GOP in 2024.\n'I think it is likely, should he not run, that folks ask him for his advice,' one Kemp adviser told The Hill. 'I think he could be a key voice to weigh in at some point on that primary.'\nSo far, only Trump has announced a bid for the party's 2024 nod, but more candidates are expected to jump in soon. Former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley is said to be planning a campaign launch later this month, and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) could enter the race later this year. Early polling suggests that DeSantis may pose the biggest threat to Trump's hopes of reclaiming the Republican nomination.\nMultiple Republicans suggested that Kemp could form something of an alliance with someone like DeSantis. Both are conservative southern governors who have found themselves at odds with Trump at one time or another.\n'I think he's going to do whatever he can to help someone like DeSantis,' said Jay Williams, a Georgia-based Republican strategist. 'In a way, they're natural allies, just from the fact that Trump dislikes both of them. They have a lot of common ground. And I do think they probably have a lot of mutual interest in seeing Trump defeated in a primary.'\nBut there's still a catch: If Trump, who is leading in most 2024 polling, were to win the GOP's nomination, that could put Kemp in an awkward place. The Kemp adviser noted that while they believe that 'Trump is in a much weaker position than what the polls suggest,' Kemp would stand behind whoever emerges from the primary.\n'The governor said that he would support whoever the nominee is, and that includes Trump,' the Kemp adviser said. 'From a policy perspective, you would believe a second term of Trump would be preferable to a second term of Joe Biden.'\nKemp himself has been the subject of occasional 2024 speculation, though several Republicans said it is more likely that he holds out to challenge Ossoff for his Senate seat in 2026. Kemp is serving out his second term in the governor's mansion, and term limits will bar him from seeking reelection again.\n'He's probably going to play things close to the vest, but I'm pretty confident he wants that Senate seat,' said one Georgia Republican strategist and Kemp ally. 'It's probably going to be his nomination in four years, if he wants it.'\nStill, if Kemp is offered the chance to be the eventual 2024 Republican nominee's running mate, 'I definitely think he would jump at that,' the strategist added.\n'I can see him being on the short list for VP,' the strategist said. 'I can't imagine why he wouldn't be. He just won reelection against a very popular, very famous Democrat celebrity.'\nRegardless, there are already signs that Kemp is looking to play a larger role on the national stage. He filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission in November forming his own super PAC \u2014 Hardworking Americans Inc. \u2014 that could be used as a vehicle to boost his national profile or lay the groundwork for a future bid for federal office.\n'The governor has not closed the door on anything in the future,' the Kemp adviser said. 'He has previously said \u2018I haven't ruled anything in or out.' That's kind of where our whole operation is.'\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to The Hill.",

    "summary": "Puerto Rican singer-songwriter Ozuna is calling 2023 his year. With a new album on the way, the release of a live album today, and an arena tour kicking off this summer \u2014 there's a lot to chat about.\n'There are a lot of challenges, a lot of newness coming my way this year,' Ozuna tells Variety over the phone. 'But I like a good challenge \u2014 and I'm at a point in my career where I have the energy to really give it my all. There's a lot of goals I want to cross off.'\n\n\n\n\nTime is of the essence for the chart-topper who will embark on a new tour that will kick off in May, and continue on through the end of the summer in Europe. He'll make stops in arenas across cities like Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Dallas and Miami \u2014 including European stops in Barcelona, Madrid, Paris and more \u2014 before wrapping on Aug. 5 in Torrevieja, Spain (see full schedule below). Tickets will go on sale on March 3, with more details to be announced soon.\n'We're working on the production side of things now, just figuring out the little details that will make up these special shows,' he says. 'Right now all I can think is \u2018practice makes perfect.''\nWith this announcement also comes the release of 'Ozu Vivo,' a 16-song live album via his Sony Music imprint Aura Music. The collection includes 13 live performances from a 2020 concert in the Dominican Republic and three acoustic versions of songs released after 2020 ('Del Mar,' 'Caramelo' and 'Despeinada').\nThough he admits producing a live album is a complicated feat, his team was used to regularly recording the audio portions of Ozuna's live shows because it's something he regularly requests 'in an effort to become a better live performer,' he says.\nHe continues, 'I grew up listening to a lot of live records like Daddy Yankee's \u2018Bario Fino en Directo' to [Don Omar's] \u2018The Last Don Live' \u2014 I feel like live albums are not something a lot of people are producing these days so it's a huge win for me to be able to do this.'\nOzuna chose his Dominican Republic appearance in 2020, a pre-pandemic show that welcomed over 60,000 audience members, because 'it holds a special place in my heart \u2014 we filmed it, we recorded the music and now the people who missed it, will be able to party with us.'\nHe's also begun teasing the rollout for a new album of original music that will 'explore what reggaeton is at its core, mixed with the afro and other rhythms,' he says. 'I'm also dedicating more time to writing by myself with this new album. I think before in my career, I hadn't given myself the time to truly sit down and write. People have loved when I've done it in the past.'\nThis year has also seen the artist delving into more business opportunities. He recently played at FIFA 2022 World Cup, and in partnership with 1800 Tequila, played to a buzzing crowd of Super Bowl watchers on the day of the big game.\nOzuna has also recently been announced as the latest ambassador for the tequila brand, who has similarly worked with musicians such as Kali Uchis, Kojey Radical, Rick Ross and more.\n'The way I see it, I am my brand\u2026and this partnership with 1800 Tequila is just another step in the right direction,' he says. 'I'm always thinking about the art with anything I do. This partnership was a super opportunity for me and the people on this team have treated me with great attention and I think it's something my fans will be able to enjoy \u2014 that means the most.'\nAnd when he isn't sipping his favorite cocktail (that's a clean tequila with sal y lim\u00f3n), Ozuna is busy working on growing the careers of other artists in a partnership with his own imprint Aura Music and his manager Vicente Saavedra's D\u00edmelo Vi record label which is home to rising acts like trap rapper Lenny Tav\u00e1rez.\n'I'm blessed to be equipped with a team that has motivated me to be bigger since day one \u2014 and I think people are going to feel and really connect with the energy of the new music and everything we have coming out,' he concludes.

    "summary": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten least innovative companies that are still in business today. For more companies, head on over to 5 Least Innovative Companies That Are Still In Business Today.\nEver since Apple launched the first iPhone, innovation has been one buzzword that hasn't gone away either in the corporate world, the media, or business schools. Every day countless boardroom meetings are held focusing on how to be innovative, publications fawn over this company being innovative or that company being innovative, and business schools rack their brains to crack the secrets of innovation once and for all.\nWith all this buzz, it seems as if innovation is essential for a firm's survival. This belief is further cemented by the list of countless firms that have gone out of business because they failed to see emerging trends. Since we started off with the iPhone, its rise to popularity put two companies out of business. Both Nokia and Blackberry failed to see the change that the smartphone would usher in, and despite being among the most popular phones out there, dropped massively in popularity. Another classic example is Eastman Kodak Company (NYSE:KODK). Kodak, which dominated the market with its films yet failed to see the utility that Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY)'s digital point to shoot camera would provide the consumer, and had to lose access to a lucrative market.\nThen, Sony failed to appreciate how the smartphone would become the go to camera of choice for people, and the cycle continues. Yet another example is of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC). Intel lost a once in a lifetime chance to dominate the smartphone market when it turned down Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s legendary founder Mr. Steve Jobs who wanted Intel to design and manufacture the processor for the iPhone. Now, Apple's partnership with the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) has made the latter the world's largest contract chip manufacturer - and Intel's biggest rival in the foundry space, one which currently holds the technological edge in chipmaking technologies.\nCommenting on the thought process that went being rejecting Mr. Jobs, Intel's then CEO Mr. Paul Otellini explained to The Atlantic that while his 'gut' told him to accept the offer, he decided to go the other way because:\nWe ended up not winning it or passing on it, depending on how you want to view it. And the world would have been a lot different if we'd done it. The thing you have to remember is that this was before the iPhone was introduced and no one knew what the iPhone would do...At the end of the day, there was a chip that they were interested in that they wanted to pay a certain price for and not a nickel more and that price was below our forecasted cost. I couldn't see it. It wasn't one of these things you can make up on volume. And in hindsight, the forecasted cost was wrong and the volume was 100x what anyone thought.\nHowever, even though innovation is king in technology, there are industries that don't change much over time. These industries often deal with commodities such as coal and oil, or basic products such as cardboard boxes, tin cans, and glass bottles. Today, we'll look at some firms that have been around for decades and are still making the same products.\nOur Methodology\nWe scoured through the business world to sift out industries that have remained static over the decades. This search led us to identify the oil and gas sector, the steel industry, cardboard manufacturing, glass bottles, and tin can manufacturing, pipe making, and the airline sector as sectors that either have little room for drastic innovations (Delta Airways after all is constrained to use the airplane to fly its passengers unless SpaceX opens its doors) or have firms that have not expanded into new industries or product markets on their own and have instead relied on acquisitions to diversify their footprint. The private firms are listed first, and the public entities are listed according to their market capitalization.\nBurch Bottle & Packaging, Inc is one of the oldest packaging products companies in the United States. The firm was set up in 1983, and since then, it has been manufacturing some of the most commonly used products out there. It serves the needs of almost thirty different industries. Some of these are the food and beverage, cannabis, honey, drink mixing, sauces, personal care, jars, jellies, and peanut butter sectors. Initially, the firm's factory was located in Watervliet, New York. But Burch Bottle & Packaging moved the factory to Queensbury, New York as part of a $2.5 million purchase of a former print shop.\nAlong with, Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (TADAWUL:2010.SR), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR),\u00a0 Burch Bottle & Packaging, Inc is one of the least innovative companies that has managed to stand the test of time and continued operating profitably.\nGeorgia-Pacific LLC is a subsidiary of Koch industries and one of oldest paper manufacturers in the world. The firm was set up in 1927 as a lumber company. In its nearly century old history, the last major change when it comes to product manufacturing and markets came in 1957, when Georgia-Pacific LLC decided to enter the paper and pulp making industry. Since then, the firm has focused on targeting more of its total addressable market (TAM) as opposed to portfolio diversification to target more industries and additional revenue streams. During this time period, Georgia-Pacific LLC has also carried out a string of acquisitions of similar firms, which include a buyout of the Fort James Corporation in 2000, which at the time was one of the biggest paper manufacturers in the world.\nThe company was acquired by Koch Industries in 2005 for a whopping $21 billion. Koch initially wanted to focus on the construction materials division of Georgia-Pacific LLC but ended up keeping the paper division as well. Georgia-Pacific LLC is based in Atlanta, Georgia and some of the products that it manufactures are toilet paper, napkins, paper towels, and tableware.\nSilgan Containers LLC is one of the oldest companies in America. It was initially set up in 1899 as a condensed milk packaging company. Silgan, in its current form, came into being in 1987 as Silgan Corporation bought Carnation Corporation's can division. Carnation was an evolution of the Pacific Coast Condensed Milk Company's can-making division that was set up in 1899. Since then, the firm has carried out a slew of acquisitions to grow its presence in the container industry. These cover 11 different acquisitions since 1987, including the famed Campbell Soup's can manufacturing operations in 1998. Silgan Containers LLC is headquartered in Woodland Hills, California, and has focused its efforts on making cans for more than a century now.\nUnited States Pipe and Foundry Company LLC is another century old company and one that has stuck to its strengths since being set up. However, unlike some other companies in our list that start out as different businesses and evolved into their current state later on, the United States Pipe and Foundry Company LLC is one of the few firms that has been making the same products for more than 120 years now. It started out as a water and wastewater products manufacturer in 1899, and it still makes and sells iron pipes, joint pipes, gaskets, and fittings such as ductile iron fittings, and joint fittings. The company has ductile iron and fabrication facilities all over America, in states including Texas, California, and Florida.\nMarket Capitalization as of January 29, 2023: $3.92 billion\nPeabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) is one of America's oldest companies. Set up in 1883, the firm is headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri. Like other firms on our list, it is the least innovative when it comes to product diversification. For more than a century, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) has simply been mining and selling coal - despite America's shift away from the dirty fuel to the cleaner burning natural gas. Additionally, the firm saw business grow in 2022 as the Russian invasion of Ukraine shook up global energy supply chains. Finally, Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU) is finally changing too, as the firm announced in 2022 that it will develop a 3.3 Gigawatt solar energy facility.\n38 of the 920 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey in Q3 2022 had bought Peabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU)'s shares, up from the 30 in the previous quarter - signaling interest in the coal industry due to the Russian invasion.\nPeabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU)'s largest hedge fund investor is Paul Singer's Elliott Management which owns 25 million shares that are worth $641 million.\nPeabody Energy Corporation (NYSE:BTU), Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222.SR), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA), and Saudi Basic Industries Corporation (TADAWUL:2010.SR) are some of the top, yet highly non innovative companies which have stayed in their industries for decades and not gone out of business.\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Least Innovative Companies That Are Still In Business Today.\nSuggested Articles:\n25 Largest Privately Held Companies in the US\n13 Cheap DRIP Stocks To Buy\n12 Best One Dollar Stocks To Buy\nDisclosure: None.\u00a010 Least Innovative Companies That Are Still In Business Today is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

    "excerpt": "Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine has asked for federal assistance in East Palestine. Here's what we know following the train derailment.",
    "summary": "The plume created by last week's burn of chemicals from a Norfolk Southern train in East Palestine had moved south along the Ohio River to Gallipolis, Ohio, state Environmental Protection Agency officials said.\nThe plume of butyl acrylate \u2013 a compound used in paints, plastics and other products \u2013 is expected to be near Huntington, West Virginia sometime Friday, the agency said. Testing results showed butyl acrylate in the water at levels below 3 parts per billion \u2013 well below the 560 parts per billion considered hazardous by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. No vinyl chloride, which was intentionally burned to avoid an explosion, has been detected in the Ohio River, EPA officials said.\nThe Ohio EPA cleared East Palestine residents to drink village water on Wednesday, over a week after a fiery train derailment caused toxic chemicals to be released in the village.\nAn eastbound Norfolk Southern Railway freight train derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, on Feb. 3, causing damage to about 50 cars, 11 of which contained hazardous materials. Vinyl chloride, a gas contained in five of the cars, was released and burned to prevent an explosion, causing toxic fumes to be released in the area. Residents were allowed to return home last week.\nHere's what we know as of Thursday.\nOhio Gov. Mike DeWine on Thursday requested federal assistance on the ground in East Palestine, according to the governor's office.\nDeWine spoke with White House officials early Thursday morning and requested assistance from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Health and Emergency Response Team, and the CDC. DeWine asked the CDC to send physicians and professionals who can examine and evaluate residents who are experiencing symptoms.\nCoverage of the East Palestine train derailment is being provided for free. Subscribe today to support local journalism and access all of our content online.\n\"Some community members have already seen physicians in their area but remain concerned about their condition and possible health effects \u2013 both short- and long-term,\" he wrote in a Thursday letter to the CDC.\nOhio is not eligible for assistance from the Federal Emergency Management Agency at this time, DeWine's office said.\nHundreds of East Palestine residents attended a meeting at East Palestine High School Wednesday evening to voice concerns and frustrations over the train derailment. But one key voice was missing: Norfolk Southern.\nMayor Trent Conaway told reporters immediately before the event that residents wouldn't get an opportunity to question the rail company involved in the incident, saying that Norfolk Southern backed out of the open house meeting.\n'Why are people getting sick?'East Palestine residents voice concerns; Norfolk Southern skips meeting\nThe mayor reiterated during the meeting that he invited Norfolk Southern \"many times.\"\nOther officials, including members of the state and federal environmental protection agencies, Dr. Bruce Vanderhoff, director of the Ohio Department of Health and U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, R-Marietta attended the meeting to try to provide some answers to residents exposed to dangerous chemicals released into the air from the derailment and through a controlled burn.\nOfficials explained that in some cases a smell may persist in the area but that may not mean the air is at dangerous levels. They also assured residents they can use their water.\nThe day after Norfolk Southern representatives skipped the town hall, Norfolk Southern CEO Alan Shaw sent a letter to residents pledging not to abandon the community.\n\"I know you also have questions about whether Norfolk Southern will be here to help make things right,\" Shaw wrote. \"My simple answer is that we are here and will stay here for as long as it takes to ensure your safety and to help\u00a0East Palestine\u00a0recover and thrive.\"\nThe Ohio EPA said East Palestine residents can safely drink village water on Wednesday, according to a release issued by Gov. Mike DeWine. The agency tested five wells that feed into East Palestine's municipal water system and no raw contaminants were detected.\nChemicals from the derailment were detected in creeks and streams near the village after the derailment, leading to the\u00a0deaths of around 3,500 fish. Ohio Department of Natural Resources director Mary Mertz said Tuesday the department hasn't seen an increase in fish deaths since the first couple of days after the incident, and there are no signs of non-aquatic life being harmed.\nNorfolk Southern is also actively aerating Sulphur Run and has contained 1.3 miles of the waterway, Tiffany Kavalec, chief of the division of surface water at the Ohio EPA, said Tuesday.\n\"Sulphur Run remains contaminated but we're confident that it is contained,\" she added.\nAcid rain could have formed after the controlled release and burn of chemicals on Feb. 6, Kevin Crist, professor of chemical and biomolecular engineering and the director of the Air Quality Center at Ohio University, said. If it did form and fall, it would have most likely occurred downwind of East Palestine.\n\"There would maybe be localized problems, but once that plume is gone, it's gone. Unless it's sticking to a residue,\" Crist said.\nVinyl chloride in the atmosphere breaks down into hydrochloric acid, a component of acid rain. East Palestine residents may want to wipe down surfaces in homes for possible residual material, Crist added.\nThe National Transportation Safety Board is still investigating what caused the train to derail. The board said Tuesday investigators identified the rail car that initiated the derailment and have surveillance video that showing 'what appears to be a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheat failure moments before the derailment.' A preliminary report is expected to be published in two weeks.\nNorfolk Southern has declined to share the route the train traveled before reaching East Palestine. But the two potential routes put the train on a path through several larger cities such as Cleveland or Mansfield.\nAt a press conference on Tuesday, Gov. DeWine said he talked to the CEO of Norfolk Southern and received promises that the railroad will stay in East Palestine until the situation is remediated.\n\"If they don't, we've got an attorney general that will file a lawsuit,\" the governor said. \"They're responsible for this. They did it. The impact on this community is huge \u2212 not just physical problem that might be caused, but the inconvenience, the terror.\"\nEast Palestine, Ohio, train derailment:Photos show fallout\nNorfolk Southern is a subsidiary of Norfolk Southern Corp., a transportation company headquartered in Atlanta.\nAlan Shaw is the CEO and president of Norfolk Southern Corp.\nEast Palestine train derailment:Water works monitors for hazardous chemical in Ohio River\nDuring Tuesday's press conference, DeWine said he was made aware on Feb. 5 that one car containing vinyl chloride was at risk of exploding. DeWine said responders were faced with \"two bad options:\" allow the car to explode, which could launch deadly shrapnel with a near-one-mile trajectory, or vent and burn the chemical.\nDeWine said Ohio and Pennsylvania authorities communicated with Norfolk and decided to prevent the explosion. Remaining East Palestine residents were evacuated from the area, and Norfolk executed the controlled release and burn of the vinyl chloride in five cars around 4:15 p.m. on Feb. 6, creating a large plume above the village.\nAuthorities and Norfolk Southern have not publicly stated how much vinyl chloride was released, but a federal lawsuit filed Thursday estimates 1.1 billion pounds of the chemical was spilled during the fire and derailment.\nPennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro wrote a letter to Norfolk CEO Alan Shaw on Tuesday expressing his concern with the company's response after the derailment. Here are some things the governor said:\nNorfolk Southern did not immediately notify the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection or the Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency about the derailment, and the agencies instead found out independently a few hours later.\nNorfolk Southern failed to implement unified command, creating confusion and lack of awareness in the response.\nNorfolk Southern did not indicate to state and local responders that it was going to vent and burn all five cars with vinyl chloride, rather than just the one that was at risk of exploding. The company also failed to say how many cars contained hazardous chemicals.\nNorfolk Southern did not want to explore possible alternatives to venting and burning the vinyl chloride. \"Norfolk Southern failed to explore all potential courses of action, including some that may have kept the rail line closed longer but could have resulted in a safer overall approach for first responders, residents and the environment,\" the governor wrote.\nVinyl chloride is a colorless gas used to make polyvinyl chloride, the hard plastic resin in plastic products, like credit cards, car parts, PVC pipe and more. Vinyl chloride exposure is associated with an increased risk of a rare form of liver cancer as well as brain and lung cancers.\nBurning it sends phosgene, a toxic gas that was used as a weapon during World War I, and hydrogen chloride into the air, which is why residents had to be evacuated. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said it is continuing to monitor the air quality in East Palestine following the release.\nThe rail cars contained vinyl chloride, butyl acrylate, ethylhexyl acrylate, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether and isobutylene, the EPA said in a letter to Norfolk Southern on Friday.\nBoth mainlines were restored to service Feb. 7, one day after the vinyl chloride release, according to Norfolk Southern.\nNorfolk Southern issued its remediation plan to the Ohio EPA on Monday. On Wednesday, the company said it has:\nCompleted more than 400 in-home air tests, none of which have yielded concerning results.\nImplemented an outdoor air-monitoring programin East Palestine and the broader region.\nIs actively sampling the\u00a0village's\u00a0drinking water supply.\nHas distributed over\u00a0$1.5 million\u00a0in direct financial assistance to more than affected 1,000 families.\nEstablished a\u00a0$1 million\u00a0fund\u00a0for the community for immediate use.\nNo injuries to the train crew, first responders or community members have been reported, according to the National Transportation Safety Board.\nA look at the data:How often do train wrecks spill hazardous chemicals into neighborhoods?\nAttorney General Dave Yost said Wednesday that his office is dropping the charges against NewsNation reporter Evan Lambert, who was arrested while\u00a0reporting on the train derailment in East Palestine.\nLocal prosecutors had charged Lambert with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and resisting arrest, but referred the case to Yost's office.\n'While journalists could conceivably be subject to criminal charges for trespassing in some situations, this incident is not one of them,\" Yost said.\u00a0\"The reporter was lawfully present at a press conference called by the Governor of the state.\u00a0His conduct was consistent with the purpose of the event and his role as a reporter.'\nThe village of East Palestine, Ohio, is about 50 miles northwest of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and about 21 miles south of Youngstown, Ohio. It is part of Columbiana County.\nSen. J.D. Vance addressed the derailment in a statement on Monday. The Ohio senator said he was \"horrified\" by the wreck and has been in constant communication with local officials, residents and DeWine's office.\n\"This is a complex environmental disaster with impacts that may be difficult to assess in the short term,\" Vance said. \"Long-term study will be imperative. As will long-term commitment to remediation by Norfolk Southern for the property damaged, the wildlife disrupted and the community scarred by this accident.\"\nRead his full statement here.\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Latest updates about the Norfolk Southern train derailment in Ohio",

    "excerpt": "BlocPower CEO Donnel Baird wants to convert buildings in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods across the country from burning fossil fuels to using lower-carbon electricity for heating. He also\u2026",
    "summary": "BlocPower CEO Donnel Baird wants to convert buildings in low- and moderate-income neighborhoods across the country from burning fossil fuels to using lower-carbon electricity for heating. He also wants to make that conversion process a money-saving and money-making enterprise for tenants, building owners and project financiers alike.\nThat's a tough proposition today. But BlocPower's software and services business model, backed by about $100 million in financing, has made it happen for more than 5,000 homes, apartments, houses of worship and commercial buildings across the country.\nOn Wednesday, the New York City\u2013based startup announced more than $150 million in new debt and equity financing to expand its electrification business. That's enough money to serve between 1,000 and 5,000 buildings, or between 1,000 and 10,000 families, Baird said in a Wednesday interview.\nBlocPower also expects this work will require the hiring and training of about 3,000 new employees, he said. Those workers will include formerly incarcerated people and residents of the lower-income neighborhoods the company serves, through its Civilian Climate Corps program in New York and planned expansions of this training program in other cities.\nWith the new funding, BlocPower has raised a total of just under $250 million. Baird, a child of immigrants from Guyana who had to heat their one-bedroom Brooklyn apartment with their gas stove during cold winter nights, said this scale of financing is more than he ever dreamed of when he first launched BlocPower in 2014.\nBut at the same time, 'this is a drop in the bucket,' he said. 'This is a $4 trillion problem.' That's an estimate of how much it will cost to retrofit all 125 million buildings in America with electric heat pumps, new insulation and windows, solar panels on rooftops suited for them, and the other features of a carbon-free U.S. building stock.\nBurning fossil fuels to heat buildings accounts for about one-tenth of U.S. carbon emissions, making building electrification key to fighting climate change, not to mention an important step in reducing the harm to human health caused by indoor fossil fuel use.\n'We're going to have to raise significant capital to electrify the whole country,' Baird said. The billions of dollars directed at home efficiency and electrification from last year's Inflation Reduction Act are important, he said \u2014 but it's just a beginning.\nBlocPower's new funding includes $130 million in debt financing led by Goldman Sachs, which also led a $55 million debt financing in BlocPower in 2021. BlocPower uses debt financing to back up its building-electrification business model, which offers low- or no-cost replacement of fossil-fueled furnaces, boilers and water heaters with electric heat pumps and other efficiency upgrades in exchange for monthly payments from building owners.\nThese monthly payments are structured to be lower than the energy bill savings that BlocPower's projects deliver to building owners and tenants to ensure they save money over the long term. That's not always easy, given the higher upfront cost for heat pumps compared to fossil-fired heating. BlocPower works with utilities, municipal governments and state and federal agencies to line up the rebates, incentives, utility-bill credits and other financial adders needed to make these complex and expensive projects pencil out economically.\n'That has to be part of the package,' Baird said. 'Where we don't have [those partnerships], that isn't a core market for us.' So far, the startup has undertaken large-scale projects in Atlanta, Buffalo, Denver and New York City, as well as Oakland, San Jose and San Luis Obispo in California. It has also inked ambitious citywide electrification plans with Menlo Park, California and Ithaca, New York.\nOne of BlocPower's key goals has been to squeeze out the 'soft costs' of building electrification retrofit projects, Baird added. That term encompasses a range of costs not tied directly to equipment or its installation, including identifying which buildings are well suited for different types of electrification projects, acquiring customers and managing the lengthy and complex inspection and permitting process with government agencies.\nThose expenses can add up to tens of thousands of dollars before any work can be completed, he noted. That's a major barrier preventing lower-income communities from even getting started on electrification. Similarly, many of the hundreds of thousands of contractors across the U.S. struggle to absorb the high upfront costs of building electrification.\nBlocPower's BlocMaps platform, which the startup sells as a software-as-a-service to the cities and community energy providers it partners with, was designed to solve those kinds of problems, Baird said. Drawing on research conducted by U.S. Department of Energy labs, the software has constructed a 'digital twin' of every building in the country.\n'Our algorithm tells us what [new appliances] should be installed in each building' and serves as a record-keeping system for project design and implementation for the contractors, lenders, inspectors and other parties involved in the process, he said.\nSimilar software platforms are being rolled out by energy-efficiency and building-electrification companies across the country to address soft costs. So far, BlocMaps has driven an 80 percent reduction in soft costs for BlocPower's New York City projects, Baird said.\n'We don't think soft costs should be a barrier to fighting the climate crisis. That cannot be why the planet burns. So let's give away the software damn near for free and eliminate a lot of the soft costs.'\nBlocPower's new funding includes just under $25 million in equity financing led by VoLo Earth with participation from investors including Microsoft Climate Innovation Fund, Credit Suisse, Builders Vision and basketball star Russell Westbrook. Much of that equity financing will be directed to developing its BlocMaps software, as well as expanding its financing, administrative and workforce-development capacity.\nBoth equity and debt financing will also be flowing to BlocPower's workforce-development efforts, Baird said. The company's Civilian Climate Corps has won $145 million in grants from New York City to train 3,000 city residents as technicians and installers, with a particular focus on providing well-paid job opportunities to previously incarcerated people and residents of disadvantaged communities threatened by gun violence.\n'We're exploring expanding the workforce model to Colorado and New Jersey, and hopefully we'll have an exciting announcement soon,' Baird said.\nWith the Inflation Reduction Act providing billions of dollars of tax credits and incentives, and states and utilities increasing the scope of funding and regulatory support for building electrification, a shortage of electricians, plumbers, HVAC installers and other skilled workers is 'going to be the bottleneck' in scaling up retrofits quickly enough to make a dent in carbon emissions, he said.",

    "summary": "The equity markets witnessed intense volatility in the past few trading sessions driven by mixed signals from the Fed that led to ambiguity and failed to paint a clearer picture of the overall economy. Although the Fed raised the interest rates by 25 basis points, much akin to the broader expectations, it kept the door ajar for future hikes as it indicated that the battle against inflation was far from over. The economic growth is also expected to remain subdued in 2023.With uncertainty becoming the norm of the day, investors often seek to employ time-tested winning strategies to fetch sustained profits. One of the most successful game plans to beat the blues is to bet on momentum stocks when value or growth investing fails to generate the desired profits.This approach primarily tends to follow the adage, 'the trend is your friend.' At its core, momentum investing is 'buying high and selling higher.' It is based on the idea that once a stock establishes a trend, it is more likely to continue in that direction because of the momentum that is already behind it. But before we delve deep into it, let us try to fathom why does the momentum strategy at all work?There are several behavioral biases that most investors exhibit in their decision-making. And these emotional responses, or rather mistakes, are the very reason that makes the momentum strategy work.For example, some investors are anxious about booking losses and hence hold on to losing stocks for too long, hopeful of a rebound in prices. On the other hand, a few investors sell their winners way too early. Momentum investing is one of the best strategies to avoid making such errors in judgment.Furthermore, investors initially tend to underreact to news, events or data releases. However, once things become clear, they have a habit of going with the flow and overreacting, causing dramatic price reactions. These behavioral problems extend trends, thus opening up huge opportunities for momentum players.To sum up, momentum investing is a way to profit from the general human tendency to extrapolate current trends into the future. It is based on that gap in time before the mean reversion occurs, i.e., before prices become rational again.In this context, stocks like Nucor Corporation NUE, Veritiv Corporation VRTV and O-I Glass, Inc. OI are worth betting on.Momentum strategies have been known to be alpha-generative over a long period and across market stages. So, this strategy is quite tricky to implement, as detecting these trends is no child's play.Here, we have created a strategy to help investors get in on these fast movers and rake in handsome gains. Our screen will help you benefit from both long-term price momentum and a short-term pullback in price.\nPercentage Change in Price (52 Weeks) = Top #50: This selects the top 50 stocks with the best percentage price change over the last 52 weeks. This parameter ensures we get the best stocks that have appreciated steadily over the past year.Percentage Change in Price (1 Week) = Bottom #10: From the above 50 stocks, we then choose those that are also among the 10 worst performers over a short one-week period. This parameter picks the ones that have witnessed a short-term pullback in price.Zacks Rank #1: Stocks sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) have a proven history of outperformance irrespective of the market conditions. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.Momentum Style Score of B or Better: A top Momentum Style Score knocks out a lot of the screening process as it takes into account several factors that include volume change and performance relative to its peers. It indicates when the timing is best to grab a stock and take advantage of its momentum with the highest probability of success. Stocks with a Momentum Score of A or B, when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2 (Buy), handily outperform other stocks.Current Price greater than $5: The stocks must all be trading at a minimum of $5.Market Capitalization = Top #3000: We have chosen stocks that are among the top 3000 in terms of market value to ensure the stability of price.Average 20-Day Volume greater than 100,000: A substantial trading volume ensures that these stocks are easily tradable.Here are three of the eight stocks that made it through this screen:Headquartered in Charlotte, NC, Nucor is a leading producer of structural steel, steel bars, steel joists, steel deck and cold-finished bars in the United States.

    "excerpt": "Productivity and efficiency initiatives, and digital growth are likely to have aided Newell (NWL) in Q4, offset by a tough environment, reduced inventory, inflationary pressures and currency rates.",
    "summary": "Newell Brands Inc. NWL is expected to witness year-over-year declines in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 earnings on Feb 10, before the opening bell.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fourth-quarter earnings is pegged at 12 cents, which suggests a decline of 71.4% from the year-ago quarter's reported figure. The consensus mark has been unchanged in the past 30 days. For quarterly revenues, the consensus mark is pegged at $2.24 billion, indicating a decline of 20.2% from the figure reported in the year-ago quarter.In the last reported quarter, the Atlanta, GA-based company delivered an earnings surprise of 12.8%. Its bottom line beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 23.7%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.\n\nNewell Brands Inc. price-eps-surprise | Newell Brands Inc. Quote\nNewell has been witnessing the continued effects of the tough macro environment, reduced inventory, inflationary pressures and the impact of a stronger dollar. The company's sales for the to-be-reported quarter are likely to have been affected by the adverse impacts of the sale of the Connected Home & Security (CH&S) business, unfavorable foreign currency, and exit of its category and retail store. The company is also expected to have been affected by the significant inflation in food, housing and energy, leading to reduced consumer discretionary spending.On the last reported quarter's earnings call, management expected the aforementioned headwinds to persist in the near term. Newell also predicted the discretionary spending levels to remain constrained.On its last reported quarter's earnings call, management envisioned fourth-quarter 2022 net sales to be $2.18-$2.26 billion, with a core sales decline of 9-12%. For the quarter, the company expects a normalized operating margin of 5.1-6.5% and normalized earnings of 9-14 cents per share. The guidance includes the impacts of unfavorable foreign currency, closures of Yankee Candle stores, and the exit of certain product categories, particularly in the Outdoor & Recreation, and Home Appliances segments.Moreover, the company expects 2022 results to reflect the adverse impacts of unfavorable foreign currency and inflation. It anticipates net sales of $9.35-$9.43 billion, with core sales expected to decline 3-4% in 2022, excluding the contribution from the CH&S business. The company anticipates a normalized operating margin of 10-10.3%. Normalized earnings per share are forecast to be $1.56-$1.61 for 2022.However, Newell has been benefiting from the actions to accelerate productivity and efficiency by accelerating fuel productivity plans, driving automation and fully implementing Project Ovid. Increased focus on revenue growth management, aggressive efforts to reduce SKU and supply network optimization are expected to have aided the fourth-quarter performance. Also, the company's stringent cost-cutting plans, such as rightsizing overhead costs based on the simplification agenda, are likely to have boosted margins and the bottom line to some extent.Newell's fourth-quarter results are expected to reflect the positive effects of leveraging its robust e-commerce capabilities, which have been strong for some time due to the increasing shifts to the online platform. The company has been strengthening its e-commerce business via increased investments and better customer engagement. Continued digital penetration, driven by expanded omnichannel capabilities, is likely to have supported the top line in the fourth quarter.\nOur proven model doesn't conclusively predict an earnings beat for Newell this time around. The combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 (Hold) increases the odds of an earnings beat. But that's not the case here. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they're reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.Newell currently has a Zacks Rank #3 and an Earnings ESP of 0.00%.\nHere are some companies that you may want to consider, as our model shows that these have the right combination of elements to deliver an earnings beat.Coca-Cola KO currently has an Earnings ESP of +0.75% and a Zacks Rank of 2. The company is likely to register top-line growth when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 results, while the bottom line is likely to be flat year over year. The consensus mark for KO's quarterly revenues is pegged at $9.98 billion, which suggests 5.4% growth from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The consensus mark for Coca-Cola's quarterly earnings has moved down 4.3% in the past 30 days to 45 cents per share. The consensus estimate for KO's fourth-quarter earnings is expected to be flat with the year-ago quarter's reported figure. KO has delivered an earnings beat of 8.8%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Molson Coors TAP currently has an Earnings ESP of +3.49% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register increases in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TAP's quarterly earnings has moved up by a penny in the past 30 days to $1.06 per share. The consensus estimate indicates growth of 30.9% from the year-ago quarter's loss per share of 9 cents.Molson Coors' top line is expected to have risen year over year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for TAP's quarterly revenues is pegged at $2.68 billion, suggesting growth of 2.4% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter. TAP has delivered a negative earnings surprise of 12.3%, on average, in the trailing four quarters.Kellogg's K currently has an Earnings ESP of +4.12% and a Zacks Rank of 3. The company is likely to register increases in the top and bottom lines when it reports fourth-quarter 2022 results. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for quarterly revenues is pegged at $3.7 billion, which suggests a rise of 7% from the figure reported in the prior-year quarter.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Kellogg's quarterly earnings has been unchanged at 84 cents per share in the past 30 days.

    "excerpt": "Delta pilots Brent and Kelly Knoblauch met as interns and flew their first plane together in January through a massive Winter storm.",
    "summary": "Delta pilots Brent and Kelly Knoblauch first met as interns in 2010. Now, they're married with two kids.\nThey said communication and flexibility is the key to both a successful flight and relationship.\nHere are their top 10 travel tips for couples, as told by Insider reporter Hannah Towey.\nThis as-told-to essay is based on a conversation with ATL-based 737 Captain and First Officer Brent and Kelly Knoblauch, who are both commercial pilots at Delta Air Lines. It has been edited for length and clarity.\nKelly: Brent and I first met in 2010, when I was still in college at the University of North Dakota. I got this call from Delta and was able to interview for a flight operations internship and ended up getting it, which totally blew me away. So I went down to Atlanta for the summer internship and on my first day walking to my cubicle \u2026 there's Brent.\nBrent: I graduated a year prior from Jacksonville University in 2008. I was a Delta intern in 2008 came back to help with our triple seven pilot group and do a sleep and fatigue study, of all things. So that's what I was doing during the summer we met. With those internships, it's a lot of fun. We get to do a lot of stuff to support our flight operations team but then also in your off time, if a seat is available, you can travel. So we spent that summer kind of traveling the world together.\nKelly: It was a group of four of us interns at the time and we would just go anywhere we could find open seats. We would hit these random cities and then eat and sleep on the airplane on the way back and be back to work by 8 a.m. on Monday. So that was kind of how our relationship first developed.\nBrent: It's been fun because ever since that point, we've really kind of been stepping together along our different career paths. I went to ExpressJet and then a year later, Kelly flew for ExpressJet, and we were flying regional jets. Then in 2014, I was hired at Delta. And then I think almost a year to the day, Kelly was also hired as a pilot back at Delta.\nBrent and Kelly both flew regional planes at ExpressJet before landing back at Delta.Courtesy of Brent and Kelly Knoblauch\nKelly: I became an airline pilot just over 10 years ago and been on the 737 at Delta since 2015. I grew up on a farm kind of watching crop dusters, and I have six brothers and sisters \u2014 so I always did my best to be the most interesting.\nBrent: I grew up in upstate New York, kind of in the Finger Lakes region. My mother was the director of the tourism bureau for our county. So we would do a lot of traveling to tourism conferences across the country as a kid. I took my first flight lesson in 2003. That summer, when I turned 16, I soloed an airplane for the first time, a little Cessna 150. My dad literally had to drive me to the airport because I didn't have\u00a0 a permit or a driver's license or anything \u2014 so I got to solo an airplane before I ever got to even drive a car.\nKelly: It's funny just how different our starts were, you know me on this farm and way up in Northern Minnesota. I had never been on an airplane at all before I went to flight school \u2014 so my first time flying was my first lesson. Growing up on the farm, I always wanted to drive things, I always wanted to be the one who got into the combine and got to harvest the wheat and I had this tractor to drive around. For a career, I knew I wanted something where I could be out and about and not sitting in an office somewhere, so I landed on aviation.\nBrent: I've helped out with our propel pilot career path program, I'm a pilot recruiter actually, and this is an extremely exciting time in our industry. If you have that interest or passion, go take a discovery flight. Go to your local airport, get in a little plane and see if you like it. There are so many opportunities out there in this industry.\nKelly: We have two little boys. They're six and four. People ask me specifically, probably more than Brent, like, \"who raises your kids?\" But I think we actually have more free time and more flexibility in this job than most people have been a regular nine-to-five.\nObviously we're very, very reliant on our childcare. I was lucky enough to talk my niece into moving in with us recently so now we kind of have a live-in nanny situation. We also have an extremely comical series of photos where Brent will drive up to the airport with the kids in the car, and we'll basically do a curbside high five, I'll jump in the car and run back home, and he'll go back to work.\nBrent: It's always been a partnership with equal roles and responsibilities. The key to any successful relationship and also by the way, any successful flight, is communication. Being able to see what you're seeing, what you're hearing, what you're suspecting, and just being open about that. I think that's something that we've learned on the job that has also benefited us so much personally.\nKelly: It's crazy how some of that training that we get in the flight deck really carries over into our personal life \u2014 sometimes in good ways, sometimes in bad ways.\nWhat's really cool is that I think we probably talk shop to each other a little more than most people. The pilot career and lifestyle is so different from most people's that when you try to communicate how it actually is, sometimes it's hard for other people to understand. But, we're able to bond over that in a way.\nBrent:\u00a0 We actually just flew a plane together for the first time in January.\nKelly: That was the first time our careers finally aligned because Brian upgraded to Captain last February and after that, I went to the training department to work as an instructor. So I ended up back on the line in January and Brent was looking at the same trip as me \u2014 so we flew the three-day trip together.\nWe started off down Panama City and up to Hartford, Connecticut and then back to Atlanta.\u00a0With the two little guys, it felt like the first time we were able to have an uninterrupted conversation in years. It was funny because we got into the airplane and you just snap into it and it was like flying with any normal Captain.\nBrent: Besides just flying together, the trip will be memorable because there was a big old storm that went up the East Coast. We were one of the planes that unfortunately had bad weather sitting over the airport and we couldn't land. We had an unplanned stop in Charleston to get gas, but everything worked out.\nKelly: It actually went really well. And I was like, well we do hard things together all the time. Like, you never know when you're going to have a kid sick in the middle of the night and you just go and deal with it.\nKelly: When we're traveling together, we have this yin-yang thing to be honest. Brent in general is more of a planner and more methodical.\nBrent: The first thing I do when I get to a hotel, at least when I'm traveling for work, I set a timeline for when I'm leaving this hotel and I immediately get myself ready for the next day. That's my organization style.\nKelly: Even when we're planning personal trips, Brent is the one planning itineraries and making dinner reservations and I just show up. So it's fun, he's able to figure out the overall structure.\nBrent: But when you're traveling, you also have to be spontaneous. And I can always count on Kelly to bring that energy and it kind of breathes new life into the whole trip.\nKelly: One of the main things that we do every time we travel is pack for flexibility because you never know what could happen. If we can manage to, we love to just travel with carry-ons, and if you can't manage carry-ons, at least have something that gets you through at night in your bag at all times.\nBrent: When you travel a lot, you learn to be very flexible and over-communicate. The other thing about being a pilot is always knowing what your other solutions are and always having a backup plan.\nKelly: The other thing too that I think passengers should have is a mental mindset that hey, everybody here wants to get this done. The pilots want to get there, the flight attendants want to get there, the gate agents definitely want us out of there. So if something's not going to plan, it's not because they're not trying hard enough.\nBe spontaneous: Don't plan out your entire trip and see where it can take you. Being spontaneous has been a fun way to bond and figure it out together. Always understanding that the journey is just as important as the destination.\nAlways pack snacks: Staying fueled helps you avoid any added travel tension.\nLearn each other's travel style and play to each other's strengths: Every couple travels in different ways. Brent is very much the planner and does all the research for the trip, where Kelly adds spontaneity and fun by showing up just ready to go at the airport.\nYour time on vacation is just as valuable as your money: Whether it is obsessing over finding the \"right\" souvenir for everyone at home or queuing for that perfect Instagram photo \u2014 you planned, waited and saved for this trip \u2014 spend your moments wisely.\nGet off the beaten path: When it comes to where you stay, what you do, and how you eat. Although it is always worthwhile to see the major attractions of a given destination, our most lasting travel memories are usually the more authentic, local, cultural experiences.\nRemember everything you pack you must carry: Nobody wants to be the person getting off the airplane with an unmanageable load of stuff \u2014 don't overpack!\nPack a portable sound machine that can help mask the thinnest walls and the inevitable late night emergency vehicle/junior high cheerleading competition in your hotel.\nCreate a fun Kodak Photo Challenge: On most vacations we have our own Kodak photo challenge. We buy a single use camera for a given trip. Sometimes the limited number of shots help you to slow down and really appreciate each moment. Plus, the printouts are usually epic.\nBrent's top hack is to create a note that lists everything you may have in your wallet: Just in case it gets misplaced. We also carry a photocopy of each other's passports and leave non-essentials at home.\nKelly's top hack is to pack a night-stand kit: Streamline your night-time routine by creating a kit with your ChapStick, phone charger, hand cream, etc. to make your time away feel a little more like home.\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

    "summary": "The Pac-12 has a ton of football teams that can make a run at the conference title next season in what will be the last year before USC and UCLA go to the Big Ten.\nThe Colorado Buffaloes made the biggest splash of the offseason by bringing in Deion Sanders and a ton of talent. On the other hand, Cam Rising is back in Utah, Bo Nix returned to Oregon and Michael Penix Jr. is at Washington again.\nOh, and Heisman Trophy winner Caleb Williams is back with a talented USC team.\nHere are a few burning questions for each Pac-12 team, according to Chris Hummer of 247 Sports:\nUSC: FRONT 7\nOklahoma State's Mason Cobb (0) celebrates after intercepting a pass in the third quarter during a college football game between the Oklahoma State Cowboys and the Texas Tech Red Raiders at Boone Pickens Stadium in Stillwater, Okla., Saturday, Oct. 8, 2022. OSU won 41-31.\nUSC's offense is loaded, but the biggest question is its defense. Adding Mason Cobb helps, but the defense will make or break the season.\nWASHINGTON: SECONDARY\nNov 19, 2022; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies linebacker Daniel Heimuli (15) and safety Asa Turner (20) tackle Colorado Buffaloes running back Deion Smith (20) during the second quarter at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\nWashington's offense is also loaded, but the bigger question is again its defense, especially in the secondary.\nOREGON: ILB CORE\nSep 18, 2021; Eugene, Oregon, USA; Oregon Ducks linebacker Noah Sewell (1) tackles Stony Brook Seawolves running back Ty Son Lawton (7) during the second half at Autzen Stadium. The Ducks won 48-7. Mandatory Credit: Troy Wayrynen-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Ducks' loss of Noah Sewell is a massive one and they will need to replace him. Having Bo Nix back at QB helps the offense not miss a beat, however.\nUTAH: HEALTH OF CAM RISING\nSeptember 24, 2022; Tempe, Arizona; USA; Utah quarterback Cameron Rising (7) passes against ASU during a game at Sun Devil Stadium.\nCam Rising suffered a torn ACL in the Rose Bowl but decided to forego the NFL for one more year. The biggest questions are when will he return and how good will he be?\nOREGON STATE: DJ UIAGALELEI\nClemson quarterback DJ Uiagalelei (5) fades back to pass near North Carolina defensive lineman Kevin Hester (98) during the first quarter of the ACC Championship football game at Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina Saturday, Dec 3, 2022.Clemson Tigers Football Vs North Carolina Tar Heels Acc Championship Charlotte Nc\nThe Beavers fared well by landing former Clemson QB DJ Uiagalelei in the transfer portal. Can he play as he did at Clemson, though?\nUCLA: QB SITUATION\nNov 19, 2022; Pasadena, California, USA; UCLA Bruins head coach Chip Kelly watches game action against the Southern California Trojans during the second half at the Rose Bowl. Mandatory Credit: Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\nFive-star QB Donte Moore is electric, but Kent State QB Collin Schlee could win the starting job as well. Whoever gets the job has big shoes to fill after the loss of Dorian Thompson-Robinson.\nWASHINGTON STATE: PASSING GAME\nSep 3, 2022; Pullman, Washington, USA; Washington State Cougars quarterback Cameron Ward (1) is forced out of the pocket by Idaho Vandals defensive lineman Zach Krotzer (96) in the first half at Gesa Field at Martin Stadium. Mandatory Credit: James Snook-USA TODAY Sports\nWashington State lost both its OC and DC this offseason, and Cam Ward needs to take a step forward if the Cougars want to make another bowl game.\nARIZONA: RUSHING DEFENSE\nNov 5, 2022; Boulder, Colorado, USA; Oregon Ducks linebacker Justin Flowe (10) during the game against the Colorado Buffaloes at Folsom Field. Mandatory Credit: Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\nJayden de Laura and the Wildcats' offense were surprisingly decent. However, Arizona needs to stop the run if they want to make a bowl game. Former Oregon Duck Justin Flowe should help in that department.\nCAL: OFFENSIVE LINE\nDec 31, 2022; Glendale, Arizona, USA; TCU Horned Frogs quarterback Sam Jackson (16) against the Michigan Wolverines during the 2022 Fiesta Bowl at State Farm Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Bears brought in TCU QB Sam Jackson V. The OL returns four of five starters, and they need to improve to have a chance of winning a few games.\nARIZONA STATE: ROSTER CONSTRUCTION\nOregon offensive coordinator Kenny Dillingham calls out to players during practice with the Ducks on Tuesday, April 5, 2022.O40522 Eug Football Practice 10\nWhenever a new coach comes in, there is almost always a ton of roster turnover, and that has been the case for the Sun Devils. How quickly can this roster gel?\nSTANFORD: OFFENSE\nSep 18, 2021; Berkeley, California, USA; Sacramento State Hornets head coach Troy Taylor kneels on the sideline during the second quarter against the California Golden Bears at FTX Field at California Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\nDavid Shaw walked away and the Cardinal hired former Sac State HC Troy Tayor. The offense needs a massive overhaul.\nCOLORADO: TRANSFERS\nDec 17, 2022; Atlanta, GA, USA; Jackson State Tigers quarterback Shedeur Sanders (2) passes against the North Carolina Central Eagles during the first half of the Celebration Bowl at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Buffs have crushed the transfer portal so far this offseason. As such, the question is, how much will these transfers make a difference? Here's what Hummer wrote:\nBut let's narrow it down a bit: What will the Power Five's worst defense, which gave up 7.2 yards per play last year, look like with an infusion of talent via the transfer portal and high school ranks? It'll be better. But whether that unit can even be average will determine if the Colorado bowl hype is legitimate.\nThe secondary figures to be considerably better.\u00a0Travis Hunter\u00a0and\u00a0Cormani McClain\u00a0are the most talented cornerback duo in the country, even if they're young. The Buffaloes also added starting-quality pieces like\u00a0Kyndrich Breedlove\u00a0(Ole Miss),\u00a0Myles Slusher\u00a0(Arkansas) and\u00a0Tayvion Beasley\u00a0(Jackson State) to help the DB room. You could say the same about Colorado's entire defense, frankly. The Buffaloes upgraded everywhere. But can a starting unit made up almost entirely of transfers and high school players come together quickly enough for this unit to be ready for a brutal non-conference schedule and a loaded Pac-12 schedule? We'll see.",

    "excerpt": "Trump allies quickly turned the impending charges against the ex-president into a litmus test for the rest of the Republican field.",
    "summary": "Donald Trump long predicted that his MAGA followers would rush to his defense if an indictment against him materialized. What became clear over the weekend was how quickly the rest of the Republican party might follow.\nAfter the former president broadcast his prediction that he would be arrested Tuesday and called for his base to protest, former Vice President Mike Pence said the case 'reeks' of 'political prosecution.' House Speaker Kevin McCarthy called it 'an outrageous abuse of power by a radical DA.' Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) said a Manhattan district attorney's expected effort to bring a criminal charge over Trump's handling of a hush money payment during his 2016 campaign was only evidence of how 'afraid' Democrats are of the former president.\nBy late Saturday, Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur and longshot presidential contender, was injecting the issue directly into the campaign, calling on the rest of the Republican field to join him in demanding that prosecutors 'abandon the political persecution through prosecution' of Trump.\nSensing an opening, Trump's campaign began to turn the impending indictment into a litmus test for the rest of the field: either defend the ex-president, they warned, or be labeled a leftist sympathizer.\nEven Trump's GOP detractors began to see the writing on the wall.\n'He's become the new Teflon president,' said Michael Brodkorb, a former deputy chair of the Minnesota Republican Party and a longtime critic of Trump. 'He is someone who has built his entire political empire on being the victim all the time, and being the martyr, and this is just another example.'\nFor the duration of the Trump era, Trump has sought to turn one seemingly disqualifying scandal after another into his benefit. Sometimes he's succeeded (the Access Hollywood tape was not the dagger everyone expected it to be), sometimes he's struggled (the aftermath of the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 remains largely unkind). In each case, he's survived.\nThe expected, coming indictment will test that once more; though, so far, the timing could hardly be better for him. If he is arrested this week, it will once more frame the early stages of the presidential primary around him, just as Pence, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and several other high-profile Republicans consider launching their own campaigns.\n'It seems very evident that the left is trying everything they can to discredit former President Donald Trump,' said Bruce Cherry, chair of Seminole County Republican executive committee in Florida, who said the 'best possible ticket this country could have' would be Trump as the presidential nominee alongside DeSantis, as his running mate. 'The indictment, I feel, doesn't mean anything.'\nIf anything, Republicans say, Trump will benefit from a short-term rush of support, much as he did following the FBI's seizure of documents from his Mar-a-Lago estate last year. It may not manifest itself in national polls \u2014 where independent and Democratic voters will be reminded of the drama and scandals that seem to perpetually follow Trump. But one national GOP strategist, granted anonymity to discuss the political fallout, said the ex-president would likely enjoy an immediate fundraising boost in an otherwise unfriendly political environment.\n'Small-dollar donors are down,' this person said. 'It's going to motivate them. It proves there is a witch hunt.'\nOn right-wing social media channels over the weekend, some Trump supporters were debating the merits of violent versus nonviolent protest, loosely contemplating a trucker strike or a bank run while others warned of a deep state 'trap.' Unlike legal challenges Trump faces in Fulton County, Ga., and in a special counsel probe around Jan. 6, the case in New York is coming from a district attorney in Manhattan, viewed by many Republicans as an epicenter of the excesses of the left.\n'In this case, I think Republicans will rally around Trump initially,' said Whit Ayres, a longtime Republican pollster. 'Long-term, it depends on what happens with this case, as well as the other criminal investigations.'\nIf Trump ends up facing multiple indictments, Ayres said, it's possible that primary voters who are at least open to other Republican presidential candidates will see him as having too much 'baggage.' But, he cautioned, no one fully can understand how it will all play out. After all, it's never happened before.\n'I have never studied the indictment of a former president and leading presidential candidate,' Ayres said, 'and I've never done any polling on the indictment of a former president and leading presidential candidate.'\nOne nagging fear of some Trump critics is that the case against him may prove to be weak, and that beating it could further embolden him. Former Rep. Peter Meijer, the Michigan Republican who lost his primary last year after voting to impeach Trump over his role in the Jan. 6 riot, said 'bullshit Dem crusades help Trump in his primary, which, if he wins, helps Dems by getting the weakest GOP candidate to the general.'\nTrump's highest profile 2024 GOP critic of late, Pence, declined to twist the knife on Saturday. Campaigning in Iowa at foreign policy forum hosted by the Bastion Institute, he told reporters: 'No one is above the law. I'm confident President Trump can take care of himself.'\nBut privately, Pence's allies have made the case that Trump is likely to face more indictments related to his efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n'He's trying to walk a pretty narrow fence line,' Mike Murphy, a former Indiana Republican state lawmaker who is close to Pence, said of the former vice president's comments. 'He's trying to keep Trump at arm's length. But at the same time he knows the Republican base is going to go nuts if this happens on Tuesday. He has to come off as empathetic to their concerns, without being empathetic to Trump. The more serious potential indictment is in Atlanta. He's going to be clear on that one that right is right and wrong is wrong.'\nIt's possible that Trump is overplaying his hand, with his call to 'Protest, take our nation back!' and with a rally on Saturday in Waco, Texas, the first of his 2024 campaign. If protests do not materialize \u2014 or if crowd sizes are paltry \u2014 'it'll show that the Trump movement is sputtering,' said one longtime Republican strategist who was granted anonymity to discuss the dynamics of the 2024 campaign.\nIt's also possible that Republicans fixated on electability will, after Trump's loss in 2020 and a disappointing midterm, see Trump's indictment as untenable in a general election.\n'At some point, some of his supporters will see that the pile-on effect of these legal actions directly affects his ability to win a general election,' said Dick Wadhams, a former Colorado Republican Party chair and longtime party strategist. 'There is a reality that could start sinking in that he's going to be diverted by these legal actions through the entire campaign, probably.'\nThe biggest fear for some Republicans, however, is that an indictment may truly hurt Trump and the GOP just when the party needs to win back independents and moderate Republicans who ran away from them in 2020. Images of an indicted former president or of the protests it sparks could be painful reminders of his time in office.\n'It helps him in the Republican primary, but he was going to win the Republican primary, anyway,' said Mike Madrid, the Republican strategist who was a co-founder of the anti-Trump Lincoln Project.\nThe problem for the GOP, he said, is that even if an indictment further intensifies Trump's base, it will do nothing for the party in the general election.\n'The intensity of a shrinking base is not the sign of a growing movement,' Madrid said. 'It's the sign of a dwarf star imploding.'\nNatalie Allison contributed to this report.",

    "excerpt": "In 2018, a \u2018Tom Brady' Super Bowl ring sold for a record $345,000. There was only one problem: Tom Brady had nothing to do with the ring.",
    "summary": "The Parker's Kitchen gas station on U.S. 301 just outside the tiny southeast Georgia town of Jesup is an unlikely spot for the start of a multi-year nationwide criminal scheme involving several hundred diamonds, several hundred thousand dollars and Tom Brady's phantom nephews.\nParker's is a franchise of coastal gas station/convenience stores, clean and pleasant, a leap up from the don't-go-in-the-bathroom roadside service stations but not quite a Disney-with-beef-jerky behemoth like Buc-ees. What the Jesup Parker's Kitchen does have is a wide parking lot, very bright lights and easy access to the highway, making it an ideal spot for a rapid exchange of a variety of goods and services at 11:00 p.m. \u2026 goods that included, on one notable occasion, a Super Bowl ring.\nRobert Kraft sported a Persian blue sportcoat and a wide smile as he welcomed the Patriots to his home. It was June 9, 2017, 15 years to the day after New England had held its first Super Bowl ring ceremony. Deflategate and Spygate were in the rearview mirror, the Tom Brady-Bill Belichick divorce years in the future. That night would be an evening to celebrate the Patriots' most remarkable achievement in a generation's worth of them.\nBrady sported his four previous rings on his left hand, the mammoth rings clinking against his cocktail glass. LeGarrette Blount draped a massive arm over Kraft's shoulders. Martellus Bennett posed, arms wide, in front of the five Lombardis on display.\nThe mood on this perfect summertime evening was joyous, and rightfully so. The 2016-season Patriots who were gathering at Kraft's estate hadn't won just any old Super Bowl. They had pulled off the most remarkable comeback in Super Bowl history, rallying from 28-3 to defeat the Atlanta Falcons and claim their fifth title.\nAt place settings across the party sat dozens of small, clear boxes. Each one featured the Super Bowl LI logo, the player's name, and the Patriots logo inscribed on the top. Each box was also sealed with a tiny, three-digit combination lock.\nYou might guess that the combination would be 2-8-3, and you would be wrong. The combination was 8, for the eight months the team had spent together since the start of training camp; 3, for the three phases of a team \u2014 offense, defense, special teams \u2014 necessary to win; and 1, for the Patriots' status as a No. 1 team. 8-3-1.\nBut there was a Super Bowl LI component, of course. The time on the clock in the third quarter when the Patriots first got the ball back after falling behind 28-3? 8:31. The time on the clock in the fourth quarter when Dont'a Hightower strip-sacked Atlanta's Matt Ryan, keeping the Patriots' rally going? 8:31.\nWhen the players opened their boxes, they found what were at that time the largest Super Bowl rings ever made. The rings tell the story not just of the Super Bowl, but of the Patriots franchise as a whole, with Lombardi trophies, Gillette Stadium's iconic lighthouse and bridge view, a sapphire-and-ruby logo, and the words 'We are all Patriots' and 'Greatest Comeback Ever' inscribed within. And it's all wrapped in diamonds \u2014 283 in all.\nIt's a ring unlike any other in NFL history. And almost every player will cherish it forever.\nFor the first 150 rings a Super Bowl champion team orders, the NFL contributes about $5,000 to $7,000 per ring. Beyond that, it's the team's responsibility to cover the whole cost. While every team gives rings to all Super Bowl-roster players, coaching staff and front office members, Kraft will often buy dozens more to give to players who passed through Foxborough at one point or another during the Super Bowl year.\nOne such player, identified in court documents as 'T.J.,' had the good fortune to pass through the New England Patriots organization while it was stacking Super Bowl trophies. T.J. played for Florida State during its most recent national championship season, and was a member of the Patriots organization in the 2016 season. New England released him shortly after Super Bowl LI, and he did not attend Kraft's June ring unveiling. But since he'd been on the payroll during Super Bowl LI, he received his own ring, which showed up in the mail in late July.\nCourt documents detail what happened next.\nA few weeks after T.J. received his ring \u2014 Yahoo Sports has identified T.J., but will not reveal his name \u2014 he opened Instagram to find a message waiting for him from a man named Scott V. Spina Jr. Representing himself as a merch and collectibles salesman, Spina, 19 years old at the time, claimed celebrity clients such as the rapper Fat Joe, and inquired whether T.J. would be interested in selling his Super Bowl ring and his rings from Florida State's then-recent national championship run. (Spina's attorney claimed in court filings that T.J. initiated the contact.) T.J. was intrigued enough to agree to a meeting, and the very next day, Sept. 25, 2017, Spina boarded a plane in New Jersey for a trip that would change both their lives for the worse.\nSpina and his girlfriend flew into the Savannah/Hilton Head International Airport, rented a car, and drove the 60 miles to the Parker's Kitchen outside Jesup. There in the parking lot, they met T.J., who was carrying boxes holding both his Super Bowl and national championship rings, and there, in the thick, humid air, they began negotiating.\nTelling T.J. he knew someone who could sell the Super Bowl ring at auction, Spina opened with an outright offer of $30,000 for the Super Bowl and several of T.J.'s college rings.\n'The college rings are worth only a few grand all together,' Spina said. 'It's the Patriot ring that's worth the amount they are paying.'\nT.J. declined, so Spina raised to $50,000, with the stipulation that T.J. would receive that amount regardless of what the rings fetched at auction. Half now, half on completion of the auction, Spina promised.\nThat was sweet enough for T.J. to swing the deal. Spina's girlfriend took photos of the two men meeting and negotiating in order to establish the ring's authenticity. According to the FBI, Spina handed T.J. two checks \u2014 one for $12,000, one for $13,000. In return, T.J. handed over the box containing his Super Bowl ring, along with all the paperwork and certificates that came with it, and the two men went their separate ways.\nSoon afterward, according to FBI investigators, T.J. tried to cash the checks. Both bounced. (It is worth noting here that Spina's attorney contended in court filings that Spina paid T.J. $20,000 in cash and $12,000 by check, acknowledging that the check bounced.)\nT.J. tried to contact Spina on Instagram, but Spina didn't respond. He had what he wanted from T.J., and was moving on, fast. Spina contacted a California-based dealer with experience in moving championship rings. Intrigued, the dealer agreed on September 29 to purchase the ring for $63,000, and flew from California to New Jersey to close the deal.\nSpina insisted on being paid in cash, and the dealer had to visit multiple Bank of America locations in New Jersey to amass the funds. Spina's written agreement with the dealer transferring ownership of the ring stated that Spina owned the ring 'free and clear,' when that was clearly not the case, but the ring changed hands again anyway.\nT.J.'s ring was gone, but T.J., according to FBI documents, did not receive any of the proceeds from Spina. That decision alone would cause Spina problems soon enough.\nBut in the paperwork T.J. had provided him, Spina discovered something interesting: a loophole he thought he could use to make himself rich.\nOwning a Super Bowl LI ring comes with a little-known perk: the ability to order additional, slightly smaller duplicate rings for one's family and friends. They're not cheap, but they're authentic, in the sense that they're manufactured by the exact same company \u2014 in the case of Super Bowl LI, Jostens \u2014 that made the original rings. (Jostens did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.)\nEvery Super Bowl ring comes with its own distinctive box, but also with paperwork that contains information on how to order additional rings. Spina read over the paperwork and quickly realized that ordering another ring with T.J.'s name would be valuable \u2026 but if he could order a ring with a certain other Patriot's name on it, that ring would be worth substantially more.\nUsing information from the player's paperwork, Spina called Jostens on Sept. 28, 2017, and began fishing.\n'I want to purchase a family ring for the Patriots,' he said, claiming that he was having problems ordering online. He spoke to a Jostens operator that court documents identify as 'Kim,' who told Spina that he could have anything he wanted printed on the ring, as long as it was within the character limit. He asked how long the ring would take to be created \u2014 six to eight weeks \u2014 and whether it could be delivered to an outside address rather than the Patriots' team facility (yes). Spina was testing the system, looking for information he could use when he called back the next day to move forward with his plan.\nOn Sept. 29, Spina called back, again posing as T.J.\n'I'm gonna place a couple of ring orders today,' he told Kim. 'I want to get, uh, a quarterback a present for his baby.'\n'What's the, um, quarterback [sic] last name that you're looking to order it for?' Kim asked.\n'Brady,' Spina replied, helpfully spelling out 'B-R-A-D-Y.'\nSpina ordered three rings, sizes eight, 11, and 12, claiming that they were for '[Brady's] family.' The cost of three rings topped $30,000, but Spina claimed his 'financial advisor' would not permit him to put them on a credit card. He asked about making a wire transfer, but was told Jostens did not accept such transfers. So he managed to put together a certified check for $31,757.86 \u2014 unlike T.J., Jostens would not take Spina's word that a personal check was good.\nAt the same time, Spina reached out to the same merchandise dealer who'd bought T.J.'s original ring, texting him that he was working 'a deal out with brady rings,' claiming that 'Brady's nephews' had agreed to sell him the rings. The dealer and Spina agreed to a price of $81,500 for the three rings.\nOn October 5, Spina arranged for a certified check to be sent to Jostens \u2014 a check which actually had Spina's name printed on it, with a handwritten memo indicating it was an order for T.J. Still, soon afterward, Jostens began work on three Brady-engraved Super Bowl LI 'family' rings.\nThat same day, Spina and the dealer executed a written contract to purchase 'Three (3) Tom Brady Family 2016 New England Patriots Super Bowl LI World Championship Rings.' Spina indicated in the contract that the three rings 'were ordered for Tom Brady directly from Jostens, for select family members.' The dealer agreed to pay $81,500 for the three rings, wiring $6,500 in advance and agreeing to pay the balance upon receipt of the rings. The dealer used three separate Zelle transfers to complete the deal, a number which would become significant to Spina's fate soon enough.\nJostens completed the new rings, shipping them out on Nov. 17 so that 'Brady' would be able to present them to his nephews as a Christmas present at Thanksgiving \u2026 or so Spina told Kim. Somewhere along the line, though, the dealer got cold feet, wondering \u2014 rightly, as it turned out \u2014 whether Brady truly had nephews that would actually sell those rings. (Brady has three older sisters and does have multiple nieces and nephews.)\nAfter the dealer backed out of the deal, Spina moved quickly, selling the rings to Goldin Auctions for $100,000. Soon afterward, in January 2018, Goldin opened an auction on the first of the Brady rings, advertising it \u2014 correctly \u2014 as a family ring, smaller than the originals.\n\"This is the first Brady award that has ever come to market,\" Goldin's Ken Goldin said at the time. \"He never lets things go, and nobody from his inner circle has ever given up something like this.\"\nThe auction \u2014 and headlines indicating the ring was 'authorized' by Brady \u2014 drew the attention of Brady's 'inner circle,' and attorneys for Brady made Goldin Auctions note that the ring was not, in fact, authorized by Brady.\nEven so, the ring sold for an astonishing amount \u2014 $344,927 \u2014 which, according to ESPN, was the highest price paid for sports memorabilia in the prior 25 years since Mike Piazza's uniform for the first game after Sept. 11 sold for $365,000 in April 2016.\nHowever, once Goldin Auctions confirmed the circumstances behind the ring's creation, the sale was canceled and the money returned to the buyer. Goldin auctions declined to speak on any other aspect of the case, and declined to indicate whether the three 'family' rings are still in the auction house's possession.\nThe fate of T.J.'s ring remains unclear as well. The dealer who originally bought the ring for $63,000 did not respond to multiple interview requests. At least two Super Bowl LI ring transactions have since occurred, one by SCP Auctions for $75,000 and another, through Lelands, for $92,146 in September 2021. Neither the player(s) nor the buyer have been disclosed in either of those. (Kraft sold his Super Bowl LI ring for more than $1 million in a May 2020 benefit auction to raise money for COVID-19 relief.)\nT.J. had long ago given up trying to get his Super Bowl ring back. Like many players who have parted with their rings, he'd been embarrassed about falling into circumstances that forced him to sell the ring in the first place, according to FBI investigators, and wanted to avoid any more publicity that came from continuing to pursue the ring. But when the FBI came calling in August 2020, he listened and agreed to help. Federal investigators had begun looking into Spina's story, and through conversations with T.J. and others, the scope of Spina's fraud became clear.\nSpina was charged with one count of mail fraud, for using FedEx to ship the contract to purchase the rings to the dealer; three counts of wire fraud for the three payments Spina received under false pretenses; and one count of aggravated identity theft, for impersonating the player to order the rings.\nThe authorities knew where to find Spina. Less than a year after his ill-fated trip to Jesup, he was in prison, locked up at FCI Schuykill in Pennsylvania and serving 35 months on an unrelated wire fraud offense. A Schuylkill prison official deemed Spina 'by far the best worker I had,' with 'an unbelievable drive to get work done.' He was released to a halfway house in November 2020, and put on supervised release in March 2021. According to a letter from his attorney, Spina worked for a time as a manager at a salon, and in May 2022 proposed to his girlfriend.\nHe was facing a maximum charge of 92 years in prison and a fine of $1.25 million. He opted to plead guilty to all counts, and in August 2022 was sentenced to 36 months in prison, where he is today. He has also been ordered to pay T.J. restitution of $63,000. (Spina, through his attorney, declined to speak to Yahoo Sports.)\nNone of the numbers Florida State has on file for T.J. are now in service, and the whereabouts of all four rings are not publicly known. The market for Super Bowl rings, however, remains strong. Every year, dozens more go up for auction.",

    "summary": "Help began pouring into one of the poorest regions of the U.S. after a deadly tornado wrought a path of destruction in the Mississippi Delta, even as furious new storms Sunday struck Georgia, where two tigers briefly escaped their badly damaged safari park.\nAt least 25 people were killed and dozens of others were injured in Mississippi as the massive storm ripped through several towns on its hour-long path late Friday. One man was killed in Alabama after his trailer home flipped over several times.\nSearch and recovery crews resumed the daunting task of digging through the debris of flattened and battered homes, commercial buildings and municipal offices after hundreds of people were displaced.\nJarrod Kunze drove to the hard-hit town of Rolling Fork, Mississippi, from his home in Alabama after hearing about the storm, ready to volunteer 'in whatever capacity I'm needed.'\n'The town is devastated,' Kunze said. 'Everything I can see is in some state of destruction.'\nKunze was among several volunteers working Sunday morning at a staging area, where cases of bottled water and other supplies were being prepared for distribution.\n'Sharkey County, Mississippi, is one of the poorest counties in the state of Mississippi, but we're still resilient,' Rolling Fork Mayor Eldridge Walker said Sunday. 'I feel confident that we're going to come back and build this community back bigger and better for our families and that's what we're hoping and that's what we're looking to do.'\n'Continue to pray for us,' he added. 'We've got a long way to go, and we certainly thank everybody for their prayers and for anything they will do or can do for this community.'\nPresident Joe Biden issued an emergency declaration for Mississippi early Sunday, making federal funding available to the areas hardest hit.\nThe recovery efforts in Mississippi were underway even as the National Weather Service warned of a new risk of more severe weather Sunday \u2014 including high winds, large hail and possible tornadoes in Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama.\nA tornado reportedly touched down early Sunday in Troup County, Georgia, near the Alabama border, according to the Georgia Mutual Aid Group. Affected areas included the county seat of LaGrange, about 67 miles (about 108 kilometers) southwest of Atlanta.\n\"Many buildings damaged, people trapped,\" the agency said on Facebook. In nearby West Point, roads, including Interstate Highway 85, were blocked by debris. 'If you do not have to get on the roads this morning please do not travel.'\nTwo tigers 'briefly escaped' early Sunday from their enclosures at Wild Animal Safari in Pine Mountain, Georgia, after the park sustained extensive tornado damage, the park announced on its Facebook page. 'THE TIGERS ARE SAFE!,' the park added. 'Both have now been found, tranquilized, and safely returned to a secure enclosure.' It added that none of its employees or animals were hurt.\nFollowing Biden's declaration, federal funding can be used for recovery efforts in Mississippi's Carroll, Humphreys, Monroe and Sharkey counties, including temporary housing, home repairs, loans covering uninsured property losses and other individual and business programs, the White House said in a statement.\nThe twister flattened entire blocks, obliterated houses, ripped a steeple off a church and toppled a municipal water tower.\nBased on early data, the tornado received a preliminary EF-4 rating, the National Weather Service office in Jackson said late Saturday in a tweet. An EF-4 tornado has top wind gusts between 166 mph and 200 mph (265 kph and 320 kph), according to the service. The Jackson office cautioned it was still gathering information on the tornado.\nThe tornado devastated a swath of the town of Rolling Fork where 2,000 people live, reducing homes to piles of rubble and flipping cars on their sides. Other parts of the Deep South were digging out from damage caused by other suspected twisters. One man died in Morgan County, Alabama, the sheriff's department there said in a tweet.\nThe Federal Emergency Management Agency said in a briefing that 25 people were confirmed killed in Mississippi, 55 people were injured and 2,000 homes were damaged or destroyed. High winds, hail and strong storms were expected for parts of Alabama and Georgia on Sunday, the National Weather Service said.\n'How anybody survived is unknown by me,\" said Rodney Porter, who lives 20 miles (32 kilometers) south of Rolling Fork. When the storm hit Friday night, he immediately drove there to assist. Porter arrived to find 'total devastation' and said he smelled natural gas and heard people screaming for help in the dark.\n'Houses are gone, houses stacked on top of houses with vehicles on top of that,' he said.\nAnnette Body, who drove to the hard-hit town of Silver City from nearby Belozi, said she was feeling 'blessed' because her own home was not destroyed, but other people lost everything.\n'Cried last night, cried this morning,' she said, looking around at flattened homes. 'They said you need to take cover, but it happened so fast a lot of people didn't even get a chance to take cover.'\nMississippi Gov. Tate Reeves issued a state of emergency and vowed to help rebuild as he viewed the damage in the region of wide expanses of cotton, corn and soybean fields and catfish farming ponds. He spoke with Biden, who also held a call with the state's congressional delegation.\nMore than a half-dozen shelters were opened in Mississippi to house those who have been displaced.\nPreliminary information based on estimates from storm reports and radar data indicate the tornado was on the ground for more than an hour and traversed at least 170 miles (274 kilometers), said Lance Perrilloux, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Jackson, Mississippi, office.\n'That's rare \u2014 very, very rare,' he said, attributing the long path to widespread atmospheric instability.\nPerrilloux said preliminary findings showed the tornado began its path of destruction just southwest of Rolling Fork before continuing northeast toward the rural communities of Midnight and Silver City and onward toward Tchula, Black Hawk and Winona.\nThe supercell that produced the deadly twister also appeared to produce tornadoes causing damage in northwest and north-central Alabama, said Brian Squitieri, a severe storms forecaster with the weather service's Storm Prediction Center in Norman, Oklahoma.\nIn Georgia, Rachel McMahon awoke Sunday morning to news from her dad that the Troup County motel he'd been staying in was totally destroyed in the storm. She said her dad, who's disabled and has a hard time moving around, took shelter in the bathtub when the tornado hit.\nHe was badly shaken up, but not injured. She went to check on him Sunday morning and had to walk the last half-mile to the motel because of downed trees blocking the road.\n'SO thankful my dad is ok,' she posted on Facebook Sunday morning, along with photos and videos of the damage: houses with gaping holes in their roofs, massive tree trunks snapped in half and powerlines dangling every which way.\n___\nAssociated Press journalists Emily Wagster Pettus and Robert Bumsted in Rolling Fork, Mississippi; Michael Goldberg in Silver City, Mississippi; Jim Salter in O'Fallon, Missouri; Lea Skene in Baltimore, and Nicole Winfield in Rome contributed to this report.\nLeah Willingham, The Associated Press",

    "excerpt": "Don't underestimate Lucille and Leo Frank: Ben Platt and Michaela Diamond dazzle in the Broadway revival of Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown's Tony award-winning musical Parade.",
    "summary": "Joan Marcus The company of 'Parade'\nIn a swathe of land near where Rosewell Road intersects Interstate 75 in Marietta, Ga., stands the memorial dedicated to Leo Frank, a Jewish man who was convicted of murdering 13-year-old Mary Phagan amid a rise in anti-Semitism in 1913. He was kidnapped from prison and lynched two years later. \"Without addressing guilt or innocence,\" it reads, \"and in recognition of the state's failure to either protect Frank or bring his killers to justice, he was granted a posthumous pardon in 1986.\"\nThe same monument is projected across the brick wall behind the stage when audiences step into the Bernard B. Jacobs Theatre each night to see Parade, Alfred Uhry and Jason Robert Brown's Tony award-winning musical that dramatizes Frank's trial and how government officials and local media played a role in his death. Following a celebrated sold-out string of performances at the New York City Center in November, the show is returning to Broadway once again for the first time since its original 1998 run in a phenomenal production that feels more poignant and powerful than ever.\nPlucked from his Brooklyn roots and deposited into the red hills of Georgia, Leo Frank (Tony Award winner Ben Platt) is a reserved, college-educated Jewish man who clings to his religious and geopolitical beliefs in a land that might as well be another planet. He finds little commonality with not only his new neighbors, but also his wife Lucille (the dazzling Michaela Diamond) and instead devotes himself entirely to the future and work as the superintendent of Atlanta's National Pencil Factory. On Confederate Memorial Day, Leo meets Mary Phagan (Erin Rose Doyle, making her Broadway debut). When she's found dead in the factory's basement, Leo is charged and later sentenced to death for her murder, kicking off a two-year legal battle that ends with his own demise. Through it all, Lucille (the sparkling Michaela Diamond) struggles to decide whether to stand with her husband or the people of Georgia.\nJoan Marcus Ben Platt in 'Parade'\nParade is much more than just a singular spectacle; it slowly and methodically highlights the ways in which Frank's tragedy isn't an isolated incident, but rather a cog in the wheel of injustice that continues to spin to this day. It can be seen in its corrupt politicians \u2014\u00a0Governor Slaton (Sean Allan Krill), prosecutor Hugh Dorsey (the viciously vibrant Paul Alexander Nolan), all the way down to local authorities (William Michals) \u2014\u00a0that select Frank as their scapegoat despite only circumstantial evidence linking him to the crime. Or how local editor Tom Watson (Manoel Felciano) and reporter Britt Craig (Jay Armstrong Johnson) profit off the town's bubbling hatred by demonizing Frank in the press, ultimately helping to push locals to commit unspeakable acts in the name of vengeance, religious extremism, and Southern nationalism. Throughout its two hour and thirty minute runtime, Parade revels in the moral ambiguity that it presents, and its outstanding 33-person ensemble dares one to inspect their own thoughts on due process and \u2014 despite its 1910s setting \u2014 see its present-day parallels, some of which are unfolding right outside its very stage door.\nThe revival also doesn't shy away from examining how race affected what would inevitably become a nationwide fervor surrounding Frank's case, with some advocating for his death and others maintaining his innocence. In one scene, Riley (Douglas Lyons) and Angela (Courtnee Carter), two of the Governor's housekeepers, imagine how the trial, and Frank's ongoing appeal process, might've played out had either parties involved been Black, singing, \"They comin' now, yes-sir-ee! 'Cause a white man gonna get hung, you see.\"\nThe duo dance atop the musical's unique set, crafted by stage designer Dane Laffrey, which features a square, elevated stage that acts as a witness stand, gravesite, and dance floor, with pews flanking its sides that add another layer of religious connotation to its stripped-back courtroom. Meanwhile, projection designer Sven Ortel grounds Parade in a harrowing sense of authenticity with his use of newspaper headlines and historical portraits that eclipse the stage's back wall, some of which are so chilling that it felt as if the air had been sucked out of the entire theater when they were displayed.\nJoan Marcus Micaela Diamond and Ben Platt in 'Parade'\nIn fact, Parade often manages to pull an emotional reaction out of its audience by suddenly twisting even its most beautiful moments into something far more menacing. When Mary is laid to rest, her childhood friends (all-stars Emily Rose DeMartino, Ashlyn Maddox, Sophia Manicone, and Jake Pedersen) mourn a sweet, young girl with crooked teeth that loved movies and cotton candy. However, it sours when Pedersen's Frankie Epps vows not to rest until Mary's killer is \"burning in the ragin' fires of Hell forevermore.\" Later, Mary's mother (Kelli Barrett) laments the loss of her daughter on the witness stand. \"I forgive you,\" she tells Leo. And, for a beat, it feels hopeful. Then, she spits out, \"Jew.\"\nPlatt gives a constrained, yet compelling performance as Leo, a man who is not only literally fighting for his life, but also to preserve his own dignity. Despite his inward nature, Platt still finds moments within Uhry's script to dazzle and delight \u2014\u00a0he easily summons laughs from the audience with his snappy, dry wit, and his complete transformation into a fictionalized lecherous, toe-tapping tempter recounted during witness testimonies is seriously sinister \u2014\u00a0but it's during Leo's devastating statement on the witness stand, \"It's Hard to Speak My Heart\", that the actor truly shines. His earnest, lilting vocals, which pour out of him like water, are laced with a heartbreaking mixture of fear and sincerity that allows an extra level of insight into the mind of a man desperately attempting to control what little he can as greater forces plot against him.\nJoan Marcus Micaela Diamond in 'Parade'\nDiamond's Lucille is the perfect foil to her reserved husband and, truly, the heart of Parade. The 23-year-old actress brings a warmth to the role as she expertly shifts gears from an unfulfilled, passive housewife into a fiery, emboldened fighter that is able to get Governor Slaton to review \u2014\u00a0and later commute \u2014 Leo's death sentence. The loyalty, passion, and optimism that Diamond imbues within the character acts as a balm for both Leo and the audience alike during the couple's darkest moments. Her searing performance of \"You Don't Know This Man,\"\u00a0Lucille's verbal takedown of reporter Britt Craig in defense of her husband,\u00a0is pure magic.\nCombine them together and Platt and Diamond's chemistry is undeniable. Their voices blend beautifully in the uplifting anthem \"This Is Not Over Yet,\" and their prison cell picnic is a bittersweet reprieve that sees both actors charmingly play off one another as their characters fall in love in the face of overwhelming adversity.\nAdd in the powerhouse vocals of Alex Joseph Grayson,\u00a0who steals every single scene as the bombastic Jim Conley, the rich baritone of Eddie Cooper in his Broadway debut, and it's easy to see why Parade is the most gut-wrenchingly gorgeous production on Broadway.

    "excerpt": "Staging his first public rally of the 2024 election cycle, Trump spent much of his time attacking the various investigations against him.",
    "summary": "Staging his first public rally of the 2024 election cycle,\u00a0President Donald Trump\u00a0lashed out at the many criminal investigations against him\u00a0\u2013 particularly the one in New York City that could lead to his indictment any day.\n\"They're not coming after me, they're coming after you,\"\u00a0Trump told fervent supporters Saturday during a rambling speech in Waco, Texas, seeking support from his political base as he faces the prospect of becoming the first former president to face criminal charges.\nThe Waco rally\u00a0\u2013 itself a source of criticism \u2013\u00a0came a week after Trump claimed he would be arrested by New York\u00a0authorities in a case that revolves around hush money to an alleged mistress. That has not happened as a New York grand jury is reportedly continuing its investigation.\nDuring the week, Trump repeatedly urged his supporters to protest the investigations in New York and elsewhere, exhortations that some lawmakers interpreted as calls to violence.\nTrump did not make such a plea during a Waco speech that lasted some 95\u00a0minutes.\n\n\n\nProsecutors in New York are investigating Trump over hush money to former adult film actress Stormy Daniels to buy her silence right before the 2016 presidential election. Investigators are looking into whether the payoff constituted an illegal campaign contribution that Trump tried to cover up.\nTrump is also under investigation in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., over efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election and the insurrection by Trump supporters on Jan. 6, 2021.\nIn Waco,\u00a0Trump attacked \u2013 but did not name\u00a0\u2013\u00a0Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, who has received death threats that included a letter with an undisclosed substance that was \"immediately contained,\" his office said.\nLaw enforcement agencies are preparing security plans in New York and Washington in the event that Trump is indicted.\nThe former sprayed attacks on an array of government agencies, from the Manhattan DA's office to the Supreme Court itself, which has ruled against executive privilege and forced Trump to turn over documents to investigators.\nJudges have also allowed prosecutors to question Trump lawyers about his handling of classified documents, another investigation that Trump is trying to blunt.\nWhile he did not urge people to protest\u00a0\u2013 at the rally at least\u00a0\u2013 Trump did strike threatening notes in his speech. He again promised to be an agent of \"retribution\" if he is again elected president, and told the crowd at one point: \"Either the deep state destroys America or we destroy the deep state.\"\nPolitical opponents assailed Trump's decision to hold an event in Waco during the 30th anniversary of the standoff between federal agents and members of the Branch Davidian religious sect. It ended in an inferno at the Branch Davidian compound that claimed nearly 80 lives.\nMary Trump, the former president's niece and one of his fiercest critics, called the site selection \"a ploy to remind his cult of the infamous Waco siege of 1993, where an anti-government cult battled the FBI.\" Before the event, Mary Trump tweeted that the former president \"wants the same violent chaos to rescue him from justice.\"\nTexas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, a prominent Trump supporter who addressed the rally, used a barnyard epithet to describe claims that the former president went to Waco because of the violent events there.\nPatrick, who ascended the rally stage as the PA system played a Brooks & Dunn song called \"How Far to Waco,\" said he picked the site because the people of the region represent\u00a0\"the American values and the Texas values and the godly values of this country ... that's that reason he's here.\"\nMcLennan\u00a0County, which includes Waco, gave nearly 61% of its vote to\u00a0Trump during the 2020 election.\n\n\nThe pro-Trump crowd that Trump seconded his attacks on law enforcement, and predicted that criminal charges would help him politically.\n\"They're doing whatever they can to stop him, but that's not gonna stop him,\" said Linda\u00a0Robinson, 75, of Robinson, Texas, near Waco. \"It will push him to an election win.\"\nOthers were unsure how it would play out, especially with Trump being challenged by Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and other Republicans.\nBrad Cox, 43, from Teague, Texas, said criminal charges \"could go either way. Politicians do a good \u00a0job of spinning things.\" While opponents like DeSantis would seek to \"capitalize on it,\" Cox said \"Trump's team would spin it in a positive manner.\"\nMembers of Congress and Texas state officials have defended Trump joined him in Waco. That included Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., whom Trump suggested should considering running for the U.S. Senate.\n\nOther than the protests about law enforcement and investigations, Trump's speech in Waco featured the usual grab-bag of issue\u00a0arguments and political attacks on President Joe Biden, \"open order fanatics,\" \"globalists,\" new election rules, military aid to Ukraine and other assorted \"vultures\" who oppose him.\nTrump again struck a near-apocalyptic tone as voters approach the 2024 election. Trump\u00a0called it \"the final battle\" and claimed that the country is \"doomed\" if it does not go well for him.\nTrump offered a lengthy attack on DeSantis, the Florida governor\u00a0who is polling the best among Trump's potential opponents for the Republican presidential nomination. He criticized DeSantis over plans to change Social Security and \"I'm not a big fan.\" rather than investigations.\nDeSantis has criticized the potential prosecution as politically motivated\u00a0\u2013 he also repeated the sordid details behind the allegations, telling reporters that, \"I don't know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair.\"\nSome political analysts mocked Trump's performance.\n\"This speech is like getting cornered by a guy at a party who is 11 beers deep and can't stop talking about how his career & marriage didn't go as well as he hoped,\" tweeted Tim Miller, a former GOP political strategist and author of \"Why We Did It: A Travelogue from the Republican Road to Hell.\"\nRepublican strategist Scott Jennings, a CNN commentator, said there was \"nothing new\" in Trump's event and \"there won't be anything new. This is what it is and we'll find out whether the Republicans want this or something evolved beyond what he represents\nTrump supporters who attended the rally at the Waco airport seemed pleased.\nTed Nugent, the Texas-based rocker, kicked off the rally with a guitar rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner. The outspoken conservative and long-time Trump supporter musician also riled up the faithful by bashing Biden on items ranging from Planned Parenthood funding to military aid for Ukraine.\n\"I want my money back!\" he said.\nTrump boosters dominated the crowd, but not everybody was a committed Trump voter.\nLisa Ventura, who said she traveled two hours to get to the Waco\u00a0rally,\u00a0wore a Trump lapel but said she hasn't decided if she'll vote for him or DeSantis.\n\"He's a good candidate, too,\" Ventura said.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump attacks prospective indictment during Waco rally",

    "excerpt": "The majority of Gen Z and millennials are online, so it's no surprise they've taken their dating life to the internet",
    "summary": "The Instagram logo seen in the background of a silhouette of a woman holding a mobile phone. Credit - Rafael Henrique\u2014SOPA Images/LightRocket/Getty Images\nIf you're dating and haven't found any success on the endless dating apps in the App Store, you may want to consider joining the group of singles using Instagram as a replacement. DMing (direct messaging) on the social platform\u2014with over 1 billion monthly users\u2014isn't new, but young people are now using it, and Instagram's newer app features, to find better dating success than from traditional dating apps.\nThese Instagram users are not alone\u2013 successful celebrity couples like Joe Jonas and Sophie Turner, and Simone Biles and Jonathan Owens, haven't shied away from the fact they've connected via the platform's DMs. Even Meghan Markle wouldn't have become royalty had her friend not posted an Instagram photo of Markle that caught the attention of her now-husband, Prince Harry.\nShooting your shot in the DMs can seem daunting, so here are some tips for flirting and dating via Instagram, according to the Gen Z users finding success with it.\nJoy Ofodu, a content creator and host of podcast Dating Unsettled who often gives dating advice to her over 200,000 followers, believes the best way to approach Instagram flirting is to first try and discern whether or not they're single.\nWhile Instagram may not give someone immediate confirmation on a potential mutual interest, like a dating app can, profiles can serve as an indicator of someone's relationship status, similar to the days of updating your dating status on Facebook. Now, for many, posting your partner on Instagram, even if just a 'soft launch,' is the go-to for letting your followers (or those lurking on your page) know where things stand with your dating life.\nIf you're still not sure after perusing their page, feel free to ask for clarity via a DM, but be sure to ask respectfully, says Ofodu. When shooting a DM, be friendly, and if the person is receptive, ask directly in a way that can potentially lead to a real-world connection\u2014 whether it be a FaceTime call or an in-person date. And if it doesn't work out the first time, don't get discouraged. 'Be persistent until you hear no and if you hear no, backup quickly and keep shooting elsewhere,' she says.\nBut traditional DMing isn't the only way to use Instagram for dating. For Dave Ramirez, a 24-year-old barista in Atlanta, GA., using the app's new 'Notes' feature (think AOL's AIM status circa early 2000's) is his bait for conversation starters. Posting a brief status on how you're feeling or a question prompt can take the pressure off of a cold-call message, and get someone who is already following you that you may be crushing on to engage in conversation.\nSome of Ramirez's other Instagram flirting techniques require more strategy. If you want to get to know someone specifically, he suggests you add them on your Instagram's 'close friends' list, a separate section of people that have access to more private content. When added, those select followers can assume they're a bit more special than the rest of the person's followers only getting main-feed content. Then deliberately post a photo or message that you think will grab that person's attention, knowing that they will likely see it and potentially 'swipe up' with a message. So far, it's been successful. 'It may sound crazy, but it works like a dream,' he says.\nPatricia Blanton, a 26-year-old archivist in Los Angeles, CA., also adds people she's interested in to her close friends list, but one of her favorite hacks is flirting with newer features like liking Instagram stories. 'It's an easy way to show someone that you're interested,' she says. Blanton is not alone. Over two billion story likes are sent on Instagram daily, according to an Instagram rep.\nRaul Martinez, 24, from Washington State, has been on nearly 20 dates via Instagram DM's and recommends you use people's Instagram's profiles as a means to gauge whether your interests and personalities would align. Martinez believes it's a better gauge than from a simple 'match' on a dating app. 'I use Instagram to share moments of my life, from fun experiences to my hobbies, so it sets up a good base for someone to see if we'd be a good fit to go on a date together.'\nAnd if you're still looking to find connections in-person, Instagram flirting can still be for you. Consider asking for someone's Instagram's handle before asking for a phone number, says Ramirez. If they have an active profile, it'll tell you way more about the person than an individualized text will.\nThe majority of Gen Z and millennials are online, so it's no surprise they've taken their dating life to the internet. According to Instagram's 2023 trend report, more than half of Gen Z social media users feel more comfortable being vulnerable online and over text than in person. The hashtag #love is Instagram's most-used hashtag of all time, with more than 2 billion uses.\nBut as much as Gen Z and millennials are online, a survey conducted by data collectors Singles Reports found that nearly 80% of the individuals surveyed were experiencing fatigue and emotional burnout from online dating. The burn out may be paving the way for more people to go back to social media platforms, like Instagram, to find more authentic connections. As much as some people may have fallen off of the Instagram bandwagon and joined the TikTok takeover, it's still one of the most popular apps, and its newer features, like updating your 'notes' status, or liking Instagram stories, has become an easier way to flirt and date than the usual Tinder or Hinge, according to users.\nOfodu was experiencing dating app burnout herself. In the span of two years, Ofodu swiped on over 3,000 dating profiles and went on more than 20 first dates. A year ago, she saw her now-partner on a dating app, but instead of just swiping right and sending a message on the app, she saw their Instagram handle on their profile and decided to send a first message on there instead. They've been dating since.\n'I thought that if I hit him up on there, I would more likely get a response and we would be able to have a bit more of a lively conversation,' she says.\nFor Barista Ramirez, 24, using Instagram was once just a means of keeping tabs on friends. Now it's his go-to app for getting to know potential dating prospects and setting up dates. The reason for his preference: people's profiles can tell more than a handful of photos and prompts on a dating app profile. Ofodu agrees, 'Instagram paints a bit more of a rich picture of the world that this person lives and operates in.'\nFor those who may prefer to meet someone IRL (in real life), consider that your next love interest may just be a DM away. 'Ultimately you are trying to meet up, so use Instagram as an avenue to get to know somebody,' says Ofodu. 'You have nothing to lose and everything to gain.'",

    "excerpt": "The Georgia grand jury that investigated former President Donald Trump reported concerns witnesses \"may have lied under oath,\" according to judge.",
    "summary": "A Georgia grand jury is concerned witnesses lied in their investigation of former President Donald Trump and his allies' efforts to interfere in the state's 2020 election, raising the specter of potential charges.\nDescriptions of the alleged lies could be unveiled Thursday, when parts of the grand jury's long-awaited report on the Trump probe is made public. Though the witnesses won't be identified and no one has been charged, prosecutors could pursue perjury charges as leverage to broaden the investigation, according to legal experts.\nCharges for lying to investigators or perjury are rare because they can be difficult to prove and peripheral to the main case, according to legal experts. But federal prosecutors have convicted witnesses in recent years with lying to authorities during previous investigations of Trump.\n'That expands the scope of potential defendants quite a bit,' said Clark Cunningham, a law professor at Georgia State University. 'It also opens up the possibility for the district attorney to proceed immediately with perjury indictments, which would be pretty straightforward.'\nA perjury charge in Georgia, which carries a maximum 10-year prison term,\u00a0could be used to leverage testimony for more serious conspiracy charges carrying a maximum 20-year term, according to legal experts. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis hired an expert in conspiracy cases\u00a0against Racketeering Influenced and Corrupt Organizations and legal experts said she may pursue RICO charges in this case.\nA RICO charge alleges the suspect participated in at least two crimes, as part of a pattern of criminal activity. State and federal prosecutors\u00a0\u2013 including Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani\u00a0\u2013 have wielded RICO laws in recent decades\u00a0to combat organized crime and drug dealing. Dozens of charges qualify to build a RICO case, including perjury, bribery and tampering with\u00a0witnesses or evidence.\nWillis has brought RICO cases against Atlanta school officials and alleged gang members, which is why some legal experts expect her to use the statute in the Trump investigation.\nTom Morgan, a criminology professor at Western Carolina University and a former district attorney in DeKalb County, Georgia, said he probably wouldn't pursue\u00a0stand-alone perjury charges from a grand jury because those cases are difficult to prove. But he said perjury felonies\u00a0could become part of a broader RICO case.\n'It makes the other counts stronger in the RICO case because it shows a pattern of covering up,\" Morgan said. \"Juries don't like that.'\nPerjury carries a prison term of one to 10 years and a fine up to $1,000, if\u00a0convicted under Georgia state law. it's defined as 'knowingly and willfully\" making a false statement under oath in a judicial proceeding about something important to a case.\nFulton County Superior Court\u00a0Judge Robert McBurney\u00a0said the\u00a0part of the report to be released Thursday\u00a0'discusses the concern that some witnesses may have lied under oath during their testimony to the grand jury.'\nDefenses against perjury charges include witnesses thinking they were telling the truth or making\u00a0a false statement without knowing it was a mistake.\nAn average of fewer than 30 people per year during the last decade were charged with perjury in Georgia and fewer than 10 per year were convicted, according to the Georgia Bureau of Investigation. Yearly convictions twice peaked at 17\u00a0during the last decade and there were none last year, according to the agency.\n'In my career, I'm not aware of a perjury indictment based on grand jury testimony,' said Morgan, a former 12-year prosecutor. 'It's very rare.'\nSamuel Gross, a law professor emeritus at the University of Michigan, said perjury is common, but prosecution of it is rare. Anecdotally\u00a0in civil cases, witnesses sometimes lie in response to questions they consider unrelated to the point of the case, Gross said. In criminal cases, police might lie about the justification for a search or defendants might lie to avoid being found guilty, he said.\n'Perjury is really, really, really common,\" said Gross, referring to a phrase he doesn't like: \"testi-lying.\"\nFederal prosecutors have charged witnesses with lying to investigators, either as stand-alone charges or in combination with broader cases.\nAmong the convictions in special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election were retired Gen. Michael Flynn, Trump's national security adviser, of lying to FBI investigators; Rick Gates, Trump's deputy campaign chairman, for conspiracy against the United States for making false statements; George Papadopoulous, a Trump campaign foreign policy adviser, for making false statements to the FBI; and Alex van der Zwaan, a Dutch lawyer, for making a false statement to investigators. Trump later pardoned Flynn, Papadopoulos and van der Zwaan. Gates cooperated with prosecutors.\nSpecial counsel John Durham's only conviction in his probe of how the Russia investigation got started came when former FBI lawyer\u00a0Kevin Clinesmith\u00a0pleaded guilty to falsifying an email used to support the surveillance of a suspect.\nThe Georgia Supreme Court decided in a key 2016 case there was enough evidence to convict\u00a0a DeKalb County chief executive of perjury and attempted extortion, although the verdict was overturned for technical reasons about evidence allowed at trial. The executive, Burrell Ellis, had been charged with demanding a $2,500 campaign contribution from a county vendor and then lying about threatening to end the company's contract with the county.\nIn Fulton County,\u00a0Willis asked the special purpose grand jury to investigate attempts to interfere with the 2020 election.\nThe inquiry covered Trump's call Jan. 2, 2021, to state Secretary of State Brad\u00a0Raffensperger, asking him to\u00a0\"find\" enough votes for Trump to win the state. Trump has denied wrongdoing and described the call as \"perfect.\" Another\u00a0aspect of the inquiry deals with the Trump campaign recruiting an alternate slate of presidential electors, in an attempt switch Georgia's results from President Joe Biden to Trump.\nThe 75 witnesses who were summoned included Trump advisers such as Giuliani; Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.; and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga.\nGiuliani, who has been told he is a target of the investigation, testified to state lawmakers about alleged voter fraud. Graham called Raffensperger and his staff in the weeks after the election. Gingrich advocated a strategy to have the House decide the election, which Trump would have won because a majority of state delegations were Republican.\nGiuliani, Graham and Gingrich have each denied wrongdoing. No charges have been filed and their testimony hasn't been revealed.\n\nCunningham said if he were Willis, he wouldn't charge Trump immediately \u2013 even if he could \u2013 because the former president has numerous defenses that could slow down the case. Instead, Cunningham said people charged with perjury could become cooperating witnesses against higher level conspirators.\n'That puts the district attorney in a position to immediately start working with defendants who might become cooperating witnesses and could really open things up,' Cunningham said.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Trump Georgia investigation: Suspected witness lies raise questions",

    "summary": "Second major order for modules, to be delivered between 2026 and 2028, to power Lightsource bp projects in US\nLightsource bp Places Multi-Year Order for 4 GW of First Solar Modules\nTEMPE, Ariz., Feb. 28, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- First Solar, Inc. (NASDAQ: FSLR) today announced that global solar leader, Lightsource bp has placed an order for 4 gigawatts (GW)DC of advanced thin film solar modules. The modules, scheduled to be delivered between 2026 and 2028, are expected to power Lightsource bp projects in the United States. This latest deal follows a prior order by Lightsource bp for up to 4.3 GWDC signed in 2021, and places the company on the path to becoming one of the world's largest users of First Solar's ultra-low carbon solar technology.\n'The US solar industry is at a pivotal moment, poised to expand at an exponential rate with the Inflation Reduction Act serving as the catalyst,' said Kevin Smith, chief executive officer, Americas, Lightsource bp. 'We are seizing the opportunity by not just growing our 20 GW development pipeline across the United States, but also creating sizeable demand for our US-based partner First Solar, which, in turn, is investing in innovation and manufacturing, and supporting thousands of direct and indirect American jobs.'\nThe deal includes orders for First Solar's Series 6 Plus and next-generation Series 7 modules.

    "summary": "Aaron V. Christiansen; VP of Operations; Oil-Dri Corporation of America\nChristopher Lamson\nDaniel S. Jaffee; Chairman, CEO & President; Oil-Dri Corporation of America\nLeslie A. Garber; IR Manager; Oil-Dri Corporation of America\nSusan Marie Kreh; CFO; Oil-Dri Corporation of America\nOperator\nThank you for standing by, and welcome to Oil-Dri's Q2 Fiscal Year 2023 Investor Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I would now like to hand the call over to Chairman, President and CEO, Dan Jaffee. Please go ahead.\nDaniel S. Jaffee\nThank you very much, and welcome, everyone, to our second quarter and first 6 months of fiscal 2023 investor teleconference. With me today virtually is Susan Kreh, our CFO; Aaron Christiansen, VP of Operations; Chris Lamson, Group Vice President of Retail and Wholesale; Laura Scheland, VP of Strategic Partnerships and General Counsel; David Atkinson, VP Controller; and Leslie Garber, Manager of Investor Relations. I would like everyone to know you'll see that Wade Robey is not on the call today. Our Animal Health team is currently at the VIV, V-I-V, show in Asia. It's in Bangkok, Thailand. And I'm getting texts and videos. It's going very well. But due to the time change and their commitments, we will be answering any questions that we can related to Amlan and our Animal Health business, but if there are questions that are better answered by Wade, we will save those for the third quarter earnings teleconference when he will be back on the call. And again, Wade is our President of Amlan International. So Leslie, please walk us through the safe harbor.\nLeslie A. Garber\nGreat. Thank you, Dan, and welcome, everyone. On today's call, comments may contain forward-looking statements regarding the company's performance in future periods. Actual results in those periods may materially differ. In our press release and in our SEC filings, we highlight a number of important risk factors, trends and uncertainties that may affect our future performance. We ask that you review and consider those factors in evaluating the company's comments and in evaluating any investment in Oil-Dri stock. Thank you for joining us. Dan?\nDaniel S. Jaffee\nGreat. Before I turn it over to Susan Kreh for her to walk us through the financials, just some general 50,000-foot comments that are highlighted in the release but are worth rementioning. So first of all, very excited. We broke $100 million for the quarter. We're at $200 million through the halfway point in revenues, which is great. You can see that we have -- had improved margins. We only made 17.3% last year in the quarter, now 22.6%. But the point being from first quarter to second quarter, relatively flat around the 22.5% margin. And we are very mindful that we need to get back to historic norms of 27%, 28%. We still have pricing action and, fortunately, some costs are starting to come down. You'll hear about those. And so we do feel confident that we will continue to show sequential margin improvement going forward, and we're very much living our mission of creating value from sorbent minerals. So I don't want to steal too much of the thunder, so I'll turn it over to Susan to walk us through the financials.\nSusan Marie Kreh\nThank you, Dan. As a reminder from our last quarterly call, our investors have asked us to reserve more of the time on this investor call for questions and to spend less of the call on formal comments. So we understand that you've read the materials or we'll assume that, that we published. So I'll just make a few brief comments on the quarter. First of all, as Dan highlighted, net sales of $102 million represent an all-time record quarter for Oil-Dri and a 17% increase over the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven by pricing actions across multiple products in order to cover the input cost increases that Oil-Dri has had to absorb. Overall, pricing was up 19% in the quarter compared to the same period last year, and the pricing increase was offset by a 2% decrease in volume, primarily attributable to low-margin products in our consumer catheter business. The strong year-over-year performance in pricing drove a significant 48% improvement in gross margin dollars. That being said, and as Dan pointed out in his opening comments, our gross margin percent of 22.6% remained flat with the first quarter of fiscal 2023. So we still have some work to do in pricing in order to cover our costs and return to pre-pandemic gross margin levels. During the quarter, we booked a onetime charge of $1.977 billion net of tax to establish a reserve. I thought I would provide a little bit of the back story here. And if you have further questions, we have Dave Atkinson, our Vice President, Corporate Controller on the line; as well as Aaron Christiansen, our VP of Operations, who have in-depth knowledge around this matter. But to go back, in 1996, Oil-Dri began operating a landfill at our Ochlocknee, Georgia plant, in order to dispose off waste generated at the plant to avoid using public landfills. This space is primarily unusable clay discarded during processing, along with some packaging in lumber. This is actually the only landfill that the company operates. In 2018, our regular monitoring and permit renewal activity identified that the landfill exceeded its permitted expense in heights and area. We self-identified this issue and reported it to the Georgia Environmental Protection division. A task force made up of Oil-Dri leaders was created with the directive signed viable sales outlets for this waste material. However, this met with little success. So fast forward to September 14, 2022, the Georgia Environmental Protection division, (inaudible) to Oil-Dri, noting that the landfill was overfilled and that Oil-Dri was being required to provide a work plan to relocate the overflow -- overfill in the current cells within the permitted landfill boundaries. The Oil-Dri team engaged outside consultants to advise on the preparation of a response to the Georgia Environmental Protection division, and to develop viable plans for modification of the landfill. In the second quarter, Oil-Dri determined its only viable option was to begin excavating new landfill cells within the permitted extent and to relocate the overfill into those new cells. This plan is expected to take up to 2 years and is currently estimated to cost $2.5 million before tax or $1.977 billion net of tax, and that is the amount that was booked in the quarter. So those being the most -- 2 most notable results, the strong pricing and the onetime accrual in our very strong quarter. With that, Dan, I'll turn it back over to you.\nDaniel S. Jaffee\nGreat. Thank you. And Leslie, let's go through the questions. We appreciate it. We had a lot of good questions come in, and we'll cover as many of them as we can.\nLeslie A. Garber\n(Operator Instructions) So we have a few in the queue already. The first one comes from Brad Evans at Heartland Funds. He says, I'm hearing from multiple players that private label is taking share from branded players across categories based on widening price gaps and struggling consumer finances. What are you seeing on private label demand And how that might be helping or hurting your branded product shelf space with your retail partners. Chris, do you want to address that?\nChristopher Lamson\nSure. And thanks, Leslie, and thanks, Brad. And Brad, you're hearing, right? That is, I think, a broader trend in fast-moving consumer goods and definitely holds true in litter as well from a total category perspective. And we've been asked this question kind of in different forms, probably over the last 3 quarters. The answer really remains the same, and I'll talk about it from a category perspective first and then how it impacts us at Oil-Dri in our consumer litter business. Really, we're seeing -- again, you're right, we're seeing a bifurcation in the market where private label and value brands are gaining share. And by bifurcation, I also mean the upper end of the market is gaining share as well. So crystal alternatives are doing very well as well. Getting squeezed in the middle is really -- and we saw probably most significantly in this last quarter, private label gain share well ahead of the big 3 consumer brands in the category. I would also note and maybe a new trend consistent with price value, the course segments or the non-scoopable segment which has been on a slow decline in favor of scoopable and alternatives over many, many, many years, actually showed a modest uptick relative to scoop. So actually the segment gained a slight amount of share over the last quarter. So lots of signs pointing to the consumer with -- in the face of inflation being very price value sensitive and cash outlay sensitive. For us, the question may have been framed a little bit of, hey, could that be hurting you. The short answer is no. It's not. So it's not from a standpoint of value brands. We're also benefiting along with private label. And it's not from the perspective of -- we still have a decent size of business in course. And finally, it's also not hurting us and in fact, helping us from the perspective of -- we've got a strong and growing and premium private label lightweight business that we feel very good about, and it is experiencing tailwinds just as the rest of private label is in the segment. So across the board, these trends have -- are providing, I'd call them, modest to solid tailwinds that we don't see letting up. Back to you, Leslie.\nLeslie A. Garber\nGreat. Thank you. Okay. The next question comes from Robert Smith from the Center for Performance Investing. I'm actually going to combine 2 of his questions. Are you capable of reaching $40 million in revenues for Amlan this fiscal year? And what are the parameters for pricing Amlan products? And then his second submission was what is the reasonable gross target range for Amlan over the next several years?Dan, do you want to take that?\nDaniel S. Jaffee\nSure. So the blunt answer is no. We are not going to make $40 million this year. At the midway point, we're up a good 30%. We feel we'll finish the year up about 33%. And last year, we did about $21 million. We think we can do about $28 million. Well, our running rate be in the 30s. We sure hope so. Still showing growth, but it's a long cycle and they're slow to move in and they're slow to move out, but we're still gaining, obviously, as we move forward. Our pricing is very simple. It's value pricing. So we're replacing antibiotics and we price our products so that they are of a significant value to our customer as they use our products to do all sorts of beneficial things, live birth rate and obviously, less mortality, weight gain, all the different metrics that they use and then we try and share in that value. Regarding going further out, Bob, your guess would be as good as mine at this point. it's so dependent. It's like I've said all along, I'm amazed that we are hitting some singles here or doubles being up 33% but it's pretty much a business of grand slams or strike outs, and we're still in the testing phase on a lot of major customers. We're getting a lot of activity. We had a great show in Atlanta I'm hearing feedback. We're having a great show in Bangkok. So we are still very bullish on it. And in the meantime, all of our other businesses are also doing well. So it's sort of a good time to the Oil-Dri.\nLeslie A. Garber\nGreat. The next question comes from Ethan Star, a private investor, and he asks, are you expanding your capacity to manufacture Amlan products? If so, if the previous capacity was x, what will the new capacity be as a multiple of x?Aaron, do you want to field that?\nAaron V. Christiansen\nEthan, I'm happy to field your question. I believe we've provided a similar update in past quarters. So it's a great opportunity to update on the work. Simple answer is we already have and are continuing to invest in added capacity in front of the Amlan growth. A large appropriation was made in the prior fiscal year '22 and in fiscal '23 to add capacity in at least one of our facilities for Amlan. Approximately 2/3 of that work is complete. The remaining 1/3 will take place in front of the anticipated Amlan growth curve, timing is to be determined. We would prefer for a number of reasons to not devote the details of the size of the capital allocation and specifics of the capacity that is added, but I can assure you we have a very well-put together plan to have capacity in front of the Amlan growth.\nLeslie A. Garber\nGreat. Thanks, Aaron. The next question is from Eric Cinnamond from Palm Valley Capital. And he asks, there was a time when Oil-Dri hedged half of its natural gas use. Given the sharp decline in natural gas prices, has there been any consideration of reimplementing the natural gas hedging program?Aaron, do you want to take that one also?\nAaron V. Christiansen\nYes. Eric, that's a great question. I'll start with saying, yes. Oil-Dri has reenacted the purchase of buying natural gas forward. I do want to speak to the word hedge that's inferred in your question. We don't think of it as a means to beat the market we are purchasing natural gas in a very conservative and algorithmic way to average price over time. It provides our businesses a better visibility to allow for pricing decisions and takes volatility out of the cost structure. Our purchase strategy will have no more than 40% of the required volume in a given month that's bought in a mechanism that has gas secured forward.\nLeslie A. Garber\nGreat. Okay. The next question is from Bill Patterson, individual investor, and he asks, how much stock has been repurchased by the company year-to-date and how much left under authorization. Susan?\nSusan Marie Kreh\nYes, sure. Bill, thanks for the question. We've actually made no open market share repurchases year-to-date. However, we have repurchased 7,493 shares at a cost of 225,000 that were surrendered by employees to pay taxes related to restricted stock awards. So that's the only activity we've had in that category. As far as what's left outstanding, we have authorization to repurchase 429,033 shares left under our current authorization.\nLeslie A. Garber\nThe next question is from Ethan Star. Recently, there's been an increase in expenses to support strategic initiatives, including money spent on outside services. Could you please discuss these strategic initiatives and how they will make a difference?Dan, do you want to talk about some of the B2B?\nDaniel S. Jaffee\nYes, I'll take the B2B, and then I'll turn it over to Chris for the retail and wholesale. And as I alluded to in one of my answers, it is a good time to be Oil-Dri. We have winning strategies in each of our major business units. And so you know about Amlan, and it is winning, it is growing. We're continuing to attract global talent. We just hired a person to take over Latin America for us. We hired him from Tyson's Cobb. He's joining his fellow Cobb teammates. We have a whole new team there. And -- but he's very talented, very successful, and we're excited about the impact he's going to have on our business south of the border and all the way south through Latin and Central and South America. And so our strategies are working in Amlan. We are continuing to leverage our clay as our unique sustainable competitive advantage, and it's what gives us traceability and quality all the way to the mine.Then over in our next largest B2B business, it's in the fluids purification side and the trend towards renewable diesel is great for us, and specifically, it's in our backyard, a lot of new plants opening up in the United States, and they use our clay to remove trace metals. And the beauty of it is they're buying oil that's already been refined many a times by our clay to remove other things. And then when they get the oil, they then need to use another one our products as a final polishing step. And so that strategy is working very well. The ag business is continuing to grow our -- specifically tailored spherical granules, our Verge granules, which has been a big investment over the years. We are basically sold out and putting in more capacity there. And that's all very much in line with creating value from sorbent minerals. So our strategies are working on B2B. And we've got some exciting strategies over on the consumer side as well that I'll let Chris talk about.\nChristopher Lamson\nAnd I think we highlighted these in a -- put a pretty good spotlight on them in the shareholder meeting or annual meeting last time around. But we continue to be extremely excited about the lightweight segment of the catheter category and what our unique mineral does within that category and the strong performance that drives within the category, but we really see it as our role to do everything we can to ignite the lightweight segment. We've talked this before, it's just below 20% of the overall scoopable segment. But if you look up to Canada, it's well above 50% now. And the opportunity to move the U.S. in that direction is obviously enormous to Oil-Dri. It's enormous from an environmental benefit. You take upwards of 30,000 truckloads a year off the roads in the U.S. So we're doing a number of things, really, what I think of as kind of a 360-degree consumer approach to get there. In the short term, and you'll see this over the next -- over the back half of the year, we're totally focusing our consumer demand spend on the lightweight segment really shifting from previously where we focused on litter for good. That's probably the closest and most tangible thing that you'll be able to see play out in the marketplace again over the next -- over the coming months through the end of the fiscal year and beyond. In addition to that, we're extremely focused on and Dan says it well, if the product performed as well as heavyweight, why wouldn't everybody -- who's going to choose heavyweight. Who's going to want to log 50% more weight up the stairs of their apartment building, really nobody. Our product performs well. Can it perform better? Yes, and we're extremely focused on our IP against that product performance improvement. And candidly, we'd be under and (inaudible) and a little more bailed, but we would be interested in helping other players in the category ignite lightweight as well, so through selling innovation, for instance. Now that clearly is further out. So a ton of effort focused on growing lightweight and sort of pun intended. We do see what's happened in the Canadian market as a bit of our north star.\nLeslie A. Garber\nGreat. Thanks, Chris. So we have 2 remaining questions in the queue, but they are really best answered by Wade Robey, our President of Amlan International. And as we mentioned before, he is not on the call this quarter. So we're going to save those for next quarter when he is in attendance. And Dan, I'm just going to turn it back to you for any closing remarks.\nDaniel S. Jaffee\nGreat. Well, thank you, and thanks to the Oil-Dri team and for our loyal shareholders. It was a very good quarter. We believe we have a lot of positive momentum heading into the third and then finally into the fourth quarters of this fiscal year. And as always, we look to the long term. So we are making investments that may or may not pay out this year. But we're confident they will pay out in the long run. And we're benefiting this year from investments that were made years ago that are starting to come to fruition. So thank you for your patience. And I think you know we've got the -- what the next Board meeting is in March, but then in the June Board meeting is when we will discuss any kind of dividend action. But we're certainly proud of our record of increased dividends, and I'm sure dividend increase will be a hot topic of conversation at our June meeting. So thank you for your support, and we will talk to you again in about 3 months.\nOperator",

    "excerpt": "Efforts to keep costs down and make railroads more efficient have made trains less safe, experts told USA TODAY.",
    "summary": "In 2013, a train derailment and subsequent fire in Lac-M\u00e9gantic, Quebec, killed 47 people and required all but three downtown buildings to be demolished for safety reasons. The following year, a derailment in Casselton, North Dakota, spilled nearly 500,000 gallons of crude oil and\u00a0caused $13.5 million in damage, prompting the Obama administration to push for a new safety rule to govern the transportation of hazardous materials, avoid environmental disasters and save lives.\nThe effort to create a new safety rule was fought by industry lobbyists, including Norfolk Southern Corp., the Atlanta-based company whose train derailed in eastern Ohio and spilled chemicals earlier this month, leaving residents in East Palestine worried about their air, soil and water quality.\nWhen the safety rule was issued in 2015, however, it was narrowly crafted and required only\u00a0 electronically controlled brakes \u2013 which applies braking simultaneously across a train rather than railcar by railcar over a span of seconds \u2013 to be installed by 2023. It applied only to certain 'high-hazard flammable trains' carrying at least 20 consecutive\u00a0loaded cars filled with\u00a0liquids like crude oil.\nThe Trump administration repealed the rule three years later, stating that its cost exceeded the benefits.\nEfforts to reduce costs including lobbying\u00a0against\u00a0costly regulation, increasing train lengths, reduced inspection times\u00a0and major cuts to the railroad workforce have made trains less safe, labor representatives and industry experts told USA TODAY, increasing the potential for accidents like the one in Ohio to become more common.\nStill, in general, major derailments leading to public evacuations, chemical spills or loss of life are relatively rare compared with the vast amounts of hazmat cargo railroads transit.\nWe crunched the numbers:\u00a0How often do train wrecks spill hazardous chemicals into neighborhoods?\nHad industry lobbying interests not prevailed on the 2015 rule, the Norfolk Southern Railway train involved in the Feb. 3 derailment\u00a0may have\u00a0been equipped with the better braking system, shown in studies to reduce the size of a derailment pile up when emergency braking is applied.\n\"ECP brakes would have avoided that monster pile up behind the derailed car,\" said Steven Ditmeyer, a former senior official at the Federal Railroad Administration. \"In fact, depending on when the crew got the (error) notice from the wayside detector, applying the ECP brakes would have stopped everything very quickly.\n\"So I think it would have helped.\"\nNorfolk Southern referred to the industry group, the Association of American Railroads for comment, around lobbying over ECP brakes.\nAssociation of American Railroads spokeswoman Jessica Kahanek said in an emailed statement that several railroad operators have tested out ECP brakes and found them to have a \"significant\" failure rate and lengthy repair time that makes them impractical.\nWhen such electronically controlled brakes fail, she said, trains become immovable and it can cause major disruptions. So instead, railroads use locomotives throughout a train to try to distribute a brake signal more quickly among cars, Kahanek said.\nIn a 2017 report, the National Academy of Sciences said it was unable to \"make a conclusive statement about the emergency performance of ECP brakes\" compared with other braking systems based on the results of the provided DOT testing and analysis.\nThe rule-making saga and its ultimate repeal are emblematic of the politically and financially difficult task of making improvements to the nation's railroad system, which has left the industry mostly stuck with post-Civil War-era technology in its braking systems, even as other\u00a0new technologies meant to streamline operations, are adopted.\nRailroad operators have seen increasing competition from long-haul truck drivers for transporting goods to such a degree that over the last decades its executives have instituted a business philosophy known as precision scheduled railroading, which focuses on maximizing the use of trains by the individual carload, that has led to longer, heavier trains crisscrossing the nation's railroad tracks in the name of efficiency and better shareholder returns.\nBut heavier and longer trains also mean that when something goes awry, the consequences can be far more catastrophic.\n\"If you have a very small error of some sort, most often a mechanical failure,\u00a0you can all of a sudden have a very expensive derailment,\" said Karl Ziebarth, a longtime transportation consultant who has contracted for the Federal Railroad Administration.\n\"All of these things (industry trends)\u00a0together show the pursuit of lower operating ratio (or costs) may spin off in other directions and cause catastrophic failures,\"\u00a0Ziebarth\u00a0added.\nThe Norfolk Southern train that derailed in East Palestine was carrying flammable liquids, benzene and butyl acrylates, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The tank car carrying butyl acrylates was breached and the entire load was lost in the spill and subsequent fire, according to EPA documentation.\nThe train also had five derailed tank cars of vinyl chloride, a flammable gas not captured by the Obama-era rule despite efforts by the National Transportation Safety Board at the time to have the agency adopt a broader definition for high-hazard flammable trains that would include those carrying flammable gasses.\nThe derailed Norfolk Southern train in Ohio resulted in large plumes of black smoke over the rural 5,000-person community, as crews did a 'controlled release' of the hazardous materials on board to avoid an explosion. Residents were forced to leave their home for days, and upon returning, complained about the smell in the air, burning in their eyes and sick animals. Environmental authorities continue to monitor the air quality and residents and business owners have banded together in a federal class-action lawsuit accusing Norfolk Southern of negligence.\nIn a Norfolk Southern 2015 lobbying disclosure, the company noted that it lobbied both Congress and the executive agencies working on the Department of Transportation rule, and 'opposed additional speed limitations and requiring ECP brakes.'\nNorfolk Southern's vice president of government relations, Rudy Husband, told Pennsylvania lawmakers in June 2015 that while the rail industry would comply with the new rule, it has 'serious concerns about the ECP brake requirements and the potential adverse impacts on the fluidity of the national freight network.'\nIn the company's 2021 annual report, Norfolk Southern Corp. told investors it had concluded its three-year plan to transform into a more 'innovative and efficient railroad,' reaching record levels of productivity across its operations, including increasing average train weight by 21% and train length by 20%.\nThe Atlanta-based company's railway subsidiary operates across 22 states and Washington, D.C., but it's not the only company with trains that have grown in length.\nAverage train lengths in 2017 were between 1.2 and 1.4 miles, according to data provided by two major railroads to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, an increase of 25% since 2008. And the Association of American Railroads, an industry trade group, found that most trains have grown by roughly 2,700 feet, or 26 additional cars per train, over the last decade.\nNorfolk Southern's train in Ohio, at roughly 150 cars long, stretched nearly 1.9 miles, the company said. Preliminary indications are that a wheel bearing in the final stage of overheat failure occurred moments before the derailment and may have caused the crash, the NTSB said Tuesday. The train's crew received an alarm from a wayside defect detector shortly before the derailment indicating a mechanical issue and then an emergency brake application was initiated, according to the NTSB.\nThe labor union, the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen, has noted that very long trains can lead to interruptions in radio communications with crew members or wayside defect detectors. There are no regulatory standards for wayside detectors. The labor union also noted in a presentation last month that very long trains can impact braking performance, decrease time for thorough inspections and increase the likelihood of catastrophic derailments.\nThe Federal Railroad Administration does not place limits on freight train length, but the agency states in documents that 'existing safety issues may be exacerbated as train length continues,' including insufficient time for human inspection of rail cars, losing communication with equipment and people, and wearing out equipment more quickly.\nThe National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine is now studying the impacts of trains longer than 7,500 feet, with federal officials looking to see if new regulations are necessary. That study is expected to be completed in November, according to the Federal Railroad Administration.\nWhen a train using conventional air brakes tries to stop, the air pressure signal is sent sequentially at a speed slightly slower than sound from railcar to railcar, generating increasing amounts of 'in-train forces' due to individual cars pushing and pulling against one another, as cars at the front of a train begin to reduce speed before cars at the back.\nThe longer the train, the more difficult it is to skillfully stop, and the more likely it is an emergency braking scenario goes awry.\nOver the last decade, as trains have grown longer and heavier, both the total number of reported accidents and the percentage of accidents on major tracks with 150 or more railcars have both gone up, according to a January presentation by the Federal Railroad Administration.\nFewer and longer trains means data around overall railroad accidents can make it appear as if there have been fewer accidents over the last decade. But a USA TODAY analysis of federal safety data by rate of train accidents per million train miles shows that the rate of accidents has been ticking up for Norfolk Southern progressively over the last decade. So too have the numbers around hazmat cars damaged or derailed, with 14 damaged or derailed in 2012, a peak of 117 in 2020 and 85 in 2021.\nIn 2017, a 121-car Norfolk Southern train derailed in Pell City, Alabama, leading to a release of hazardous material with minor evacuations.\u00a0 In 2020, a 230-car Norfolk Southern train with 78 hazmat cars derailed in Rocky Gap, West Virginia. Three of the hazmat cars were damaged, with the company chalking up the cause to railcars not being put in proper order.\nConnor Spielmaker, a spokesman for Norfolk Southern, said the company's data on accidents along major\u00a0railroad tracks, which impacts the public more directly than incidents at one of the company's facilities, shows that accidents are on a flat or downward trend depending on the years selected for analysis.\nBut USA TODAY's review of the rate of so-called \"main line\" train accidents per million\u00a0train miles, also consistently trended slightly upward over the last decade ending in 2021, federal safety data shows.\nThe railroad industry has cut roughly 30%, or 45,000 total workers\u00a0since 2015, and since deploying precision scheduled railroading. Norfolk Southern has shed roughly 40% of its 30,456-person workforce. By the end of 2021, the company employed 18,100 workers, according to U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filings.\nMeanwhile, major railroad operators including Norfolk Southern\u00a0have paid out $196 billion in buybacks and dividends since 2010, much more than the $150 billion spent on infrastructure improvements during that time, said Martin J. Oberman, chairman of the North American Rail Shippers Association, in a 2021 speech.\n'In our view, I don't think you can separate the drastic reduction in workforce over the past seven or eight years, from the increase in accidents, the rate of safety incidents,' said Greg Regan, president of the Transportation Trades Department of the AFL-CIO, the union representing rail labor. 'What people see on the ground is a really big amount of pressure on moving as fast as possible, as lean as possible, and generating as much profit as possible.'\nRegan noted that because there is no minimum inspection time required for railcars, the time taken for workers to inspect cars has dropped from two minutes to 40 or 45 seconds.\nThere has also been an effort to introduce more technology in lieu of human workers or in place of a physical inspection, Regan said, but when such technology fails, the lack of eyeballs and workers to address an issue can lead to accidents.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Norfolk Southern's Ohio train disaster could happen again.

    "summary": "A check is written, signed and dated instructions for a bank to transfer funds. To mail one, you have to wrap that piece of paper in a second piece of paper and then stick a third piece of paper on the outside to prove you paid to have it travel to its destination on at least one gas-burning vehicle.\nIf that sounds like a primitive way to move money, you're in good company.\nSee: What To Know If You Deposit More Than $10K Into Your Checking AccountFind Out: Here's How Much Americans Have in Their Savings Accounts in 2023\nAccording to a GOBankingRates survey of 1,000 American adults, 45% haven't written a single check in the last year \u2014 another 12% wrote fewer than six.\nIt's nothing new \u2014 the writing was on the wall for checks long before COVID forced a shift from in-person to app-based banking. Like manual transmissions and fax machines, paper checks aren't quite gone yet, but the museum has a spot all picked out.\u00a0Here's why.\nIn 2012, the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia predicted paper checks would be extinct by 2026 \u2014 but according to Business Insider, the clock had been ticking since 9/11.\nUntil that day, physical checks worth billions of dollars were packed onto trucks, shipped to sorting facilities and then loaded onto airplanes every single day. When the FAA grounded all flights on Sept. 11, 2001, the Check 21 Act allowed banks to verify funds with images of checks instead of physical paper.\nThere was no turning back.\nMore than a decade later at the time of the Philadelphia Fed report, nearly all bank-to-bank transactions were settled electronically. According to the Atlanta Fed, the number of consumer checks declined by 63% between 2000 and 2015.\nTake Our Poll: Are You Concerned About the Safety of Your Money in Your Bank Accounts?\nAt the time of the Philadelphia Fed report, the shift away from physical checks was already saving the banking industry $1.2 billion annually. Faster processing was saving consumers and businesses $2 billion a year.\nThat was more than a decade ago and the trend continues today.\nThe 2022 Payments Cost Benchmarking Survey from the Association of Financial Professionals (AFP) showed that the ongoing shift from checks to ACH transfers saves money, lowers fees, reduces fraud and saves time.\nThere was a time just before the Check 21 Act when the masses didn't trust their money to new and unfamiliar emerging technologies. But today, handing a stranger a piece of paper that contains your name, address, bank account number and signature defies the most basic principles of data protection \u2014 especially since multiple people handle each check throughout the process.\nAccording to Money Magazine, your funds and data are much safer under the stewardship of modern financial cybersecurity than they are inside a 20th-century checkbook.\nThe Money report pointed out that it's not just big banks. Even payment apps like Zelle and Venmo are safer than writing checks, and they're just two among many check alternatives.\nZelle is linked directly to your bank of choice and Venmo is a third-party social app. If that's too much clutter for you, you can send and receive money on a p2p basis right through your PayPal account. Don't have one? You can use Apple Cash to send and receive funds as simple texts without leaving your iPhone's native messaging app. Don't have an iPhone? Try Google Pay.\nThat's just the tip of the iceberg. The list goes on and on until the thought of writing a check no longer makes sense.\nIn May 2022, Pymnts released research showing nearly four in 10 people are enrolled in automatic bill pay. That's a whole lot of checks never written and back-of-checkbook arithmetic never tallied.\nAlthough the money still leaves your checking account, the rise of automatic payments removed the ick from the monthly chore of paying bills. Even better, the Pymnts study showed that those enrolled in autopay were more likely to pay on time.\nThe bad news is that 'the check's in the mail' is an excuse with waning validity.\nVirtually every major bank offers mobile check deposits through their apps and websites, with limits usually in the thousands or even tens of thousands per month.\nThe process is secure and user-friendly \u2014 even the most modest technological prowess will get you through. Not only is mobile deposit free and easy, but it goes through instantly or close to it even if the funds have a clearing delay.\nAlthough one party has to write a check for a mobile deposit to happen, the shift toward online deposits further erodes the relevance of physical checks and keeps them contained to two-party transactions.\nDespite all the reasons to toss your checkbook, the GBR survey showed that more than 40% of the population still writes at least one check per month. Interestingly, 40% of respondents still visit physical bank branches mostly because they prefer to drop off their checks in person. That indicates that the residual desire to hand off written instructions while inside a bank is one of the biggest reasons branches still have their lights on.\nUnsurprisingly, age plays a significant role.\nThe survey showed that the youngest adults are by far the least likely to write checks and do their banking in person and most likely for an app to be their preferred banking method. The oldest respondents were the opposite, and the demographics in between tracked consistently and predictably toward more checks and less tech as they aged.\n\n\n\n\n\nMethodology: GOBankingRates surveyed 1,000 Americans aged 18 and older from across the country on between December 7 and 12, 2022, asking nineteen different questions: (1) What category does your current financial institution fall under?; (2) Have you considered changing Banks within the past year?; (3) If you have considered changing banks in the past year, were any of the following factors? (select all that apply):; (4) Which feature, perk, or other offering is most important to you when opening an account with a new institution?; (5) Are you currently satisfied with all your banking products and services offered by your Bank/Credit Union?; (6) Would you ever have different types of accounts across multiple banks?

    "excerpt": "NORTH WILKESBORO, N.C. \u2014 For the first time in more than a decade, NASCAR Cup Series cars roared to life Tuesday at the historic North Wilkesboro Speedway. Tyler Reddick, Austin Dillon and Chris\u2026",
    "summary": "NORTH WILKESBORO, N.C. \u2014 For the first time in more than a decade, NASCAR Cup Series cars roared to life Tuesday at the historic North Wilkesboro Speedway.\nTyler Reddick, Austin Dillon and Chris Buescher wheeled their Next Gen vehicles around the legendary 0.625-mile oval, a venue steeped in a history palpable upon arrival. North Wilkesboro was a staple upon Cup Series schedules from the sport's inauguration through 1996, its last race won by then-one-time champion Jeff Gordon for the 19th victory of what would become a 93-win, four-time title-winning career.\nThe next generation of drivers finally got their turn in a Goodyear tire test on Tuesday ahead of the May 21 NASCAR All-Star Race (8 p.m. ET, FS1, MRN, SiriusXM NASCAR Radio). Reddick was nine months old the last time multiple Cup cars hit the track in northwestern North Carolina. Dillon was 6 years old and Buescher wasn't yet 4.\nRELATED: Photos from North Wilkesboro testing | Buy tickets\nA test session at a site so unique and rich with stories made Tuesday unlike any other test.\n'I've never had that level of nostalgia coming to a test ever really,' Reddick said.\nTwenty-seven years since Wilkesboro's last NASCAR national series event and even longer since its freshest coat of asphalt, Reddick wasted no time Tuesday. He was first to hit the track in his No. 45 Toyota and immediately set out for a decent outing.\n'I'm imagining they did a lot of work to it. I mean, you can tell for sure. But for it to have sat, what, 27 years, is that right? I mean, it does not seem like it's at 27 years,' Reddick said after the session. 'That's part I guess that's the thing I'm not thinking about. I went out there and just went right to ripping laps, 20-lap run in the Next Gen car and yeah, it didn't it doesn't seem like a track that sat that long.'\nThe grandson of car owner Richard Childress, Dillon knows North Wilkesboro holds a special place in his family's lineage. Childress, of course, owned the No. 3 Chevrolet that Dale Earnhardt wheeled to five wins there and now owns Dillon's. But Dillon has ties from his father's side of the family too: dad, Mike Dillon, earned a 1995 victory late model win at North Wilkesboro and took the ride up the famed elevator to the track's one-of-a-kind Victory Lane.\n'I actually drove up here (Tuesday) with one of his old crew guys, and who kind of helps me around my house,' Dillon said. 'And he was like, I want to check out the elevator because I got to take an elevator ride. I guess I did too when I was here when I was a kid. I just don't remember it. So hopefully, we get to try and take an elevator ride for a million dollars.'\nTurning laps around the short track was a far cry from what Dillon typically thinks of when driving through Wilkes County on Highway 421.\n'Just driving by it as a kid, going into the mountains and seeing like this ghost of a track that you hear about from your family and all the good times that were had here,' Dillon said. 'And now we're getting to experience it and it's coming to life fast and it's cool to be a part of it.'\nBuescher is quite the fan of just how worn the existing pavement remains, happy the fresh asphalt has been reserved only for pit road and infield parking. He was chasing grip all day in his No. 17 RFK Racing Ford \u2014 just what he wanted.\n'It's probably not as bumpy as I thought,' said Buescher, who hadn't been back to North Wilkesboro since helping Dale Earnhardt Jr. and Speedway Motorsports President Marcus Smith clean the facility in December 2019. 'I mean it's rough. But man, I can't tell you how many other race tracks we go to where we get hits through the suspension that hit you a lot harder than anything out here. So it's probably a lot by design, just trying to make sure we get as much grip in these things as possible. It's hard to chase aero when the track's not very flat underneath you.\n'All the right reasons to make it a good race. So excited to have the All-Star (Race) here. It's amazing just seeing the progress, seeing a lot of history is still being preserved.'\nThe goal of the day, through all the glory of just getting onto the race track, was to help Goodyear determine what tire to bring in May for the exhibition event. The problem, per se, is that each driver has his own preferences behind the wheel.\nAhead of a true debrief with his team and Goodyear, Buescher said their fall-off in lap time was 'several seconds throughout runs depending which tire you were on.'\nDillon noted he thought the fall-off was 'pretty significant,' but Reddick, his former teammate at Richard Childress Racing, believes there could be even more.\n'You're kind of on ice taking off for sure. This place has got a lot of age and character to it,' said Reddick, now five races into his tenure at 23XI Racing. 'You know, you're having to pedal it pretty good. The first lap, you have to kind of be careful squeezing the gas down and as you run, you know, it's hard to get back to wide-open throttle. But you know, really, I think we were seeing a second-and-a-half fall off or so over even 50 laps, and that was kind of surprising. I figured we'd have more fall off.\n'But I mean one little miscue misstep into Turn 1 or Turn 3, you'd lose a second sliding up out of the groove and losing control of your car, so that's with no traffic, no mistakes. So maybe with more traffic and everything the fall off will be more, but certainly, we're out of control from I'd say Lap 10 on.\n'You have to really take care of your car. So I guess that's all I was really saying was hoping to make the throttle time even less, but I mean it's really hard 30, 40 laps in around it to even get wide open.'\nNorth Wilkesboro is set to become the fourth host of the NASCAR All-Star Race in the past five seasons. Texas Motor Speedway hosted each of the last two while Bristol Motor Speedway held the 2020 event. Through 2019, Charlotte Motor Speedway hosted the festivities annually since the event's 1985 inauguration, with a lone exception for Atlanta in 1986.\nMORE: Trucks test at Wilkesboro\nA facility and location previously stuck in time, North Wilkesboro is getting all dolled up for a romantic reunion with stock-car racing's biggest names, a weekend full of racing goods. Late models hit the track Tuesday and Wednesday as preludes to the NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series Tyson 250 on May 20 (1:30 p.m. ET, FOX, MRN, SiriusXM) and the Sunday night All-Star Race.\n'Dating back to 2020, I was somewhat familiar with this place,' Reddick said. 'But I had a lot of downtime as all of us did during the pandemic and I got to watch a lot of races \u2014 not necessarily here, but just old-school races, and a number of them were here. And the place just was super entertaining back then.\n'I thought to myself watching those races, man, it would've been really cool to be a part of it and to have been there \u2014 see a race there. I've thought that as I've driven by it heading to Bristol Motor Speedway through the years. So really glad we got to have that opportunity. I'm excited to see this place full of life and be a part of the event and experience.'",

    "summary": "NEW YORK, March 13, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Indaptus Therapeutics, Inc. (Nasdaq: INDP, 'Indaptus' or 'the Company'), a biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing transformative therapeutics for patients, today announces that Atlanta, Ga.-based Emory Winship Cancer Institute ('Emory') has become a new clinical trial site for INDP-D101. INDP-D101 is the Company's first-in-human, open label, dose escalation and expansion, multicenter Phase 1 clinical trial of its lead compound Decoy20 in patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors. Emory has begun screening patients.\n'Emory joining the INDP-D101 trial is both validation of the scientific concepts behind Decoy20 in early testing, as well as acknowledgement of the remaining unmet medical need, and the need for additional hope for patients with advanced solid tumors. Emory is a well renowned center, and we are grateful to include it among the other influential centers we have activated thus far. We hope to continue the pace at which we are activating trial sites in order to more rapidly advance the trial toward initial data points, which, in turn will continue to facilitate the development of what we believe is a potentially important innovation in the treatment of solid tumors,' said Jeffrey Meckler, Indaptus Therapeutics' CEO. 'We look forward to collaborating closely with the investigators at Emory, and all of clinical trial sites, which we hope to be opening in succession in the coming weeks.'\nThe study's objectives are to assess the safety and tolerability of Decoy20, to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), as well as to assess Decoy20 pharmacokinetics (PK), pharmacodynamics and clinical activity.\nThe Phase 1 study was initiated with a single dose escalation, which is planned to be followed by an expansion with continuous weekly administration of Decoy20. The study is enrolling patients with advanced/metastatic solid tumors, who have exhausted approved treatment options. More information can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.\nThe primary endpoint of the study is incidence, relatedness and severity of adverse events and treatment-emergent adverse events and determination of the number of subjects per cohort with dose limiting toxicity-based adverse events. Secondary endpoints include the incidence of anti-drug antibodies and neutralizing antibodies pre- and post-treatment, change in Decoy20 PK parameters over time, objective response rate in subjects with measurable disease and duration of response. More information can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov.\nAbout Indaptus Therapeutics\nIndaptus Therapeutics has evolved from more than a century of immunotherapy advances. The Company's novel approach is based on the hypothesis that efficient activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells and pathways and associated anti-tumor and anti-viral immune responses will require a multi-targeted package of immune system-activating signals that can be administered safely intravenously (i.v.). Indaptus' patented technology is composed of single strains of attenuated and killed, non-pathogenic, Gram-negative bacteria producing a multiple Toll-like receptor (TLR) agonist Decoy platform. The products are designed to have reduced i.v. toxicity, but largely uncompromised ability to prime or activate many of the cells and pathways of innate and adaptive immunity.\nDecoy products represent an antigen-agnostic technology that have produced single-agent activity against metastatic pancreatic and orthotopic colorectal carcinomas, single agent eradication of established antigen-expressing breast carcinoma, as well as combination-mediated eradication of established hepatocellular carcinomas and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas in standard pre-clinical models, including syngeneic mouse tumors and human tumor xenografts. In pre-clinical studies tumor eradication was observed with Decoy products in combination with anti-PD-1 checkpoint therapy, low-dose chemotherapy, a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, or an approved, targeted antibody. Combination-based tumor eradication in pre-clinical models produced innate and adaptive immunological memory, involved activation of both innate and adaptive immune cells, and was associated with induction of innate and adaptive immune pathways in tumors after only one i.v. dose of Decoy product, with associated 'cold' to 'hot' tumor inflammation signature transition.\nIND-enabling, nonclinical toxicology studies demonstrated safe i.v. administration without sustained induction of hallmark biomarkers of cytokine release syndromes, possibly due to passive targeting to liver, spleen, and tumor, followed by rapid elimination of the product. Indaptus' Decoy products have also produced significant single agent activity against chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) and chronic human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections in pre-clinical models.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis press release contains forward-looking statements with the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act.

    "excerpt": "Jabil (JBL), Delta Air (DAL), AGNC Investment (AGNC), Hologic (HOLX) and Suzano (SUZ) are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from as equity markets start 2023 on a positive note.",
    "summary": "The U.S. equity markets inched up in the past few trading sessions, buoyed by better-than-expected economic growth and healthy earnings performance from hitherto reported companies. The fourth-quarter GDP rose at a 2.9% annualized rate compared with broad-based expectations of 2.8% growth. Consumer spending was up 2.1% in the October-December period, marginally down from 2.3% on a sequential basis as inflationary pressures remain an overhang. The personal consumption expenditure price index increased 3.2%, down from 4.8% recorded in the third quarter. The employment cost index showed compensation increased 1% in the fourth quarter, slightly down from broad-based expectations of a 1.1% rise.The economic indicators aroused hopes that the Fed will likely consider putting the brakes on its aggressive stance against inflation, fueling the stock market rally. The healthy equity market uptick in January portends a relatively robust performance for the full year. Investors widely expect the rally to continue in the short term, forcing the Fed to be more dovish toward the rate hike regime. The Fed had increased its benchmark interest rates by half a percentage point in its last policy meeting to a targeted range between 4.25% and 4.5% and put the 'terminal rate' to a target range of 5-5.25%As investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of 'backing and filling' in the market, they can benefit from 'cash cow' stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. Jabil Inc. JBL, Delta Air Lines, Inc. DAL, AGNC Investment Corp. AGNC, Hologic, Inc. HOLX and Suzano S.A. SUZ are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders' EquityROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.Moreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry \u2014 the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management's efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.Price/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.Return on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength.\u00a0 \u00a0Zacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.Here are five of the 17 stocks that qualified the screen:Jabil: Headquartered in St. Petersburg, FL, Jabil is one of the largest global suppliers of electronic manufacturing services.

    "summary": "The hotter-than-expected inflation data, with the consumer price index (CPI) rising more than anticipated in January, has highlighted the fact that we are far from being out of the woods and that inflation remains a formidable foe. CPI was up 0.5% in the first month of the year, following a 0.1% rise in December and compared to expectations of a 0.4% rise.\nThe Fed, which raised interest rates by 25 basis points a few days ago, has vowed to continue with its interest rate hiking strategy to curb high inflationary pressure. \u00a0The latest report indicates that further rate hikes are necessary in this respect. Higher interest rates shoot up the cost of borrowing, escalating the chances of an economic slowdown.\nInflationary woes have primarily resulted in extreme market volatility. Despite the current turmoil and economic uncertainty, shunning equities is an absolute no-no for investors. So what's the way forward to reap handsome returns from one's portfolio even during the current uncertainty?\nOne way to proceed in this scenario is by adhering to broker advice. By following this method, broker-friendly stocks like, Archer Daniels ADM,\u00a0Delek US Holdings DK, Beazer Homes USA BZH, AmerisourceBergen ABC and\u00a0Avnet\u00a0AVT should be included in an investor's\u00a0watchlist for healthy returns.\nAs brokers indulge in extensive research on stocks under their coverage, they have access to much-detailed information on a company. To this end, they attend company conference calls/presentations and scrutinize every piece of document available in the public domain before instructing investors.\nSince brokers meticulously follow the stocks in their coverage, they revise their earnings estimates after carefully examining the pros and cons of an event for the concerned company. Naturally, their estimate revisions serve as an important pointer regarding the price of a stock.\nGiven this extensive know-how, brokers are deemed to be experts in the field of investing, equipped with thorough knowledge and a clear insight into the details pertaining to the investment world. Paying heed to such well-researched information is, therefore, logical for investors to avoid the unfortunate scenario of one's hard-earned money invested in stock markets going down the drain.\nThe above write-up clearly suggests that by following broker actions, one can arrive at a promising basket of stocks. Keeping this in mind, we have designed a screen to shortlist stocks based on improving analyst recommendations and upward earnings estimate revisions over the last four weeks.\nAlso, since the price/sales ratio is a strong complementary valuation metric in the presence of analyst information, it is considered in designing a winning portfolio of stocks. The price/sales ratio takes care of the company's top line, making the strategy extremely effective.\n# (Up- Down Rating)/ Total (4 weeks) =Top #75: This gives the list of top 75 companies that have witnessed net upgrades over the last 4 weeks.\n% change in Q (1) est. (4 weeks) = Top #10: This gives the top 10 stocks that have witnessed earnings estimate revisions over the past 4 weeks for the upcoming quarter.\nTo ensure that the strategy is a winning one, covering all bases, we have added the following screening parameters:\nPrice-to-Sales = Bot%10: The lower the ratio the better, companies meeting this criteria are in bottom 10% of our universe of over 7,700 stocks with respect to this ratio.\nPrice greater than 5: A stock trading below $5 will not likely create significant interest for most investors.\nAverage Daily Volume greater than 100,000 shares over the last 20 trading days: Volume has to be significant to ensure that these are easily traded.\nMarket value ($ mil) = Top #3000: This gives us stocks that are the top 3000 if one judges by market capitalization.\nCom/ADR/Canadian= Com: This eliminates the ADR and Canadian stocks.\nHere are five of the 10 stocks that made it through the screen:\nArcher Daniels: This Chicago, IL-based leading agricultural products player's leadership in key global trends like flexitarian diets, nutrition and sustainable materials is a contributor to its momentum. ADM's focus on making investments in assets and technological capabilities to serve customers efficiently is likely to be a key driver.\nArcher Daniels' Readiness program, positive cash flow and solid performance at the Nutrition unit are aiding results. ADM has been progressing well on its three strategic pillars, which are optimize, drive and growth, for a while. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2023 earnings has been revised 6.7% upward over the past 60 days. ADM currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see\u00a0the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\nBrentwood, TN-based\u00a0Delek US Holdings\u00a0is an independent refiner, transporter and marketer of petroleum products. DK's extensive downstream operations within the Permian Basin grant it a fairly significant competitive edge over its peers in the long term.\nDelek US Holdings\u00a0currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). DK surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in three of the past four quarters (missing the mark in the other one). The average beat is in excess of 100%.\nBeazer Homes: This Atlanta, GA-based homebuilder designs, builds and sells single-family homes. BZH, currently carrying a Zacks Rank #3, designs homes to appeal primarily to entry-level and first move-up homebuyers. BZH's subsidiary, Beazer Mortgage, originates the mortgages for the company's homebuyers.\nThe company's Balanced Growth strategy, higher pricing, lower sales incentives and solid backlog level are expected to improve profitability. BZH has seen an upward estimate revision of 2.9% for current-year earnings over the past 60 days. This depicts analysts' optimism about the company's prospects.\nAmerisourceBergen is one of the world's largest pharmaceutical services companies. It focuses on providing drug distribution and related services to reduce healthcare costs and improve patient outcomes. Strong organic growth rates in the U.S. pharmaceutical market, improving patient access to medical care, enhanced economic conditions and population demographics are likely to favor the company in the quarters to come.\nABC has seen an upward estimate revision of 1.2% for current-year earnings over the past 60 days. ABC surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate for earnings in each of the past four quarters by an average of 3.5%. Currently, the company carries a Zacks Rank of 2.\nAvnet\u00a0is benefiting from robust demand for its products across Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) regions. Improvement in the Americas also served as a tailwind. Its continued focus on boosting IoT capabilities is helping it expand in the newer markets and win customers. Moreover, cost-saving efforts are aiding profitability.\nAvnet, currently carrying a Zacks Rank of 3, has an impressive surprise history. It surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, the average being 15.5%.\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

    "summary": "Dotdash Meredith and Yahoo Inc. may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\nHere's what to look for at Ace Hardware, BBQ Guys, Amazon, and more.\nFood and Wine / Brian Kopinski\nYou could browse retailer after retailer to buy your next piece of grilling or barbecue equipment. Whether you're hunting for a pre-assembled smoker, the best wood pellets, or essential grilling tools, we've created this guide to help simplify your search. While we hesitate to overlook the many outstanding independent, local, and regional retailers, we focused this list on more prominent national or international outlets to serve the most significant geographic area. For those who want to see, feel, and touch what they're purchasing, we've included several brick-and-mortar outlets and online or predominantly online retailers for those who don't require that piece.\nWith each, we've looked at how easy it is to purchase and receive your product from them as well as whether additional services, like assembly, are available. They all have their strengths and weakness, which we've noted below. We selected these retailers for their product offerings, ease of shipping and returns, pricing, and customer service options. Read on to see our top picks, both in-store and online.\nAmazon\n\nPros: There's a wide variety of products, and returns are fairly painless.\nCons: Obtaining warranty information can be difficult, and with only an online presence, you can't physically preview the item before purchasing.\nA Product We Love: Weber SmokeFire EX4 Wood Fired Pellet Grill\nThere's very little one cannot find on Amazon. It's positioned itself to be the world's largest online retailer. Putting custom or high-end, ultra-specific products aside, when it comes to grills, smokers, barbecue accessories, and tools \u2013 down to charcoal and pellets \u2013 it's pretty much got you covered. It's also great at letting you know about things you never knew you needed. Barbecue claws? Infrared thermometers? Amazon's got you with its suggestive algorithm. Aside from selection, it has a delivery infrastructure that delivers your products quickly, sometimes on the same day. It also has an easy-to-navigate return policy in most cases, and assembly is available on-site for many products.\nOn the downside, products often ship from independent sellers, who may or may not offer the same price or shipping options across the board. Technical specifications on the website may not be accurate, so it's best to check with the manufacturer before purchasing. While you're doing that, you may also want to look into warranty information directly from the manufacturer, as that is often absent from Amazon's website. For the non-detail-oriented people who don't have the patience to read every spec and review, the online-only presence prevents you from seeing, touching, and otherwise examining a product before buying.\nShipping Cost: Many are free with a Prime membership. Domestic Standard shipping is $4.49 plus $0.50 per pound.\nShipping Time: Same day to two weeks\nReturn Policy: Most products shipped from an Amazon warehouse are eligible for a return, unused and in the original packaging. The seller must provide a return policy similar to Amazon for third-party sales.\nReturn Window: 30 days in most cases\nHome Depot\n\nPros: It carries a wide range of grilling and barbecue products at competitive prices.\nCons: Not all items are in stock, and shipping is more expensive.\nA Product We Love: ThermoPro TP20B Wireless Meat Thermometer\nHome Depot doesn't have Amazon's breadth of selection or fast delivery options. Still, it does bark at Amazon's heels in the selection department, with the added convenience of a physical presence. Should you want to purchase a fully-assembled smoker to take home today, you'll find at least some offerings at the store. While space limitations precluded having all items at every store, the online selection is vast. If a product is not in the store, shipping for customer pickup is often free, but without the near-immediate gratification of Amazon's home shipping. Home Depot, too, uses a suggestive algorithm that provides alternatives and products 'you didn't know you needed.' It carries a wide spread of best-selling and highly-rated products in the grilling world at competitive prices. It also offers professional assembly on a range of products for an additional fee.\nIn finding flaws, shipping to your door is more expensive and slower than other online retail outlets. While it offers an array of products, specific items may be outside its purview, and you may find yourself shopping multiple sites to find everything you need.\nShipping Cost: Many things over $45 come with free shipping. Free shipping for in-store pickup is also available. Other items vary by weight and destination.\nShipping Time: Two days to two weeks\nReturn Policy: Unopened, unused items are eligible for return in-store with the receipt. Online orders are processed and returned via UPS.\nReturn Window: 90 days\nLowe's\n\nPros: Competitive pricing and selection are its strongest points.\nCons: The availability of professional assembly is hit or miss, and it doesn't seem to have the same physical market saturation as its competitors.\nA Product We Love: Permasteel PA-12002 Grill Lights\nLowe's is on par with its main competitor, Home Depot, but doesn't maintain the same online market share as the latter. That doesn't mean it's a lesser outlet by any means. You'll find overlap between all the major outlets, with differentiation on specific brands and store brands in each. You can find something as basic as heat-resistant gloves or treat yourself to a Nuke Gaucho Grill. Like its contemporaries, Lowe's has many grills and smokers sold preassembled for take-home that day. Shipping is reasonably priced and efficient, and online returns are free.\nIn-store you'll find a smaller amount and diversity of products compared to online, which is expected. In the online shopping realm, options for professional assembly are hit or miss, should this be a deal breaker for you. Depending on your area, store locations may be fewer than other large retailers.\nShipping Cost: Free shipping on most orders over $45. Others vary by weight and distance.\nShipping Time: Two days to two weeks\nReturn Policy: Free returns on online orders. Most unused items are returnable in-store with the sales receipt.\nReturn Window: 90 days; 30 days for outdoor equipment\nAce Hardware\n\nPros: It has a comprehensive supply of many grills, smokers, and supplies at a competitive price.\nCons: Shipping charges apply for many items not shipped from the store.\nA Product We Love: Char-Broil Performance Series 4-Burner Gas Grill\nAce is a smaller online presence than the previous three reviewed, but the smaller presence doesn't mean a lack of options. Ace carries many top-rated or best-selling brands and items at comparable prices. If you're starting from zero, you can find everything you need to get started grilling or barbecuing in one stop \u2013 from the grill to the fuel, including LP gas, to rubs and sauces. It even has meat processing equipment like knives, cleavers, bone saws, and meat pounders, should you want to go that route. Delivery is available, as is free shipping to a store for pickup. Professional assembly is also available; for some products, it even offers a haul-away of your old item with delivery.\nIts website isn't as robust as others, but it still offers suggestions for alternatives and add-ons while shopping. Ace has a large physical presence, but delivery areas are limited; you may be paying for delivery by default due to distance limitations.\nShipping Cost: Free shipping directly from a store for orders over $50 within a pre-determined delivery area. Freight costs apply for online orders not shipped from the store.\nShipping Time: Two days to two weeks\nReturn Policy: Unused products are available for return with the receipt. Online orders are subject to return shipping charges unless they ship the incorrect item or the product is damaged.\nReturn Window: 30 days\nBBQ Guys\n\nPros: BBQ Guys stocks quality products and maintains a knowledgeable sales staff who only deal in outdoor equipment to assist you in decision-making.\nCons: There are only two physical locations, and standard shipping is on the slower end of the scale.\nA Product We Love: Jealous Devil All Natural Hardwood Lump Charcoal\nBBQ Guys, as the name suggests, deals exclusively in all things outdoor cooking or fire-generating, from grills and smokers to full outdoor kitchens. It carries many of the biggest name brands for home use and commercial models for those who want to take their game up or go pro with their cooking. With only two physical locations, one in Atlanta and the other in Baton Rouge, La., most of the sales are online, which comes with the drawbacks of not physically seeing the product you're purchasing. Still, sales and customer service people can assist you with the selection process via phone or chat. BBQ Guys also has a whole section of tested product reviews, buying guides, and recipes to help guide your decision-making process.\nThis isn't a place to shop for immediate gratification, though. When free shipping is available, it will take five to seven business days after any warehouse processing time to reach you. However, BBQ Guys is an excellent option for those who want to take their time and take advantage of trained sales staff and knowledge base.\nShipping Cost: $6.95 or free shipping on orders over $49\nShipping Time: Shipping typically takes five to seven business days after the item leaves the warehouse. Some items leave the next day, and others may take 48 to 72 hours.\nReturn Policy: Unused, unassembled products in their original packaging are eligible for return; however, all return shipping costs are deducted from the refund.\nReturn Window: 30 days\nWalmart\n\nPros: It's a quick and convenient retailer with multiple forms of shopping.\nCons: No authoritative salespeople and a vast website mean that you should be prepared and know what you're buying beforehand.\nA Product We Love: Cuisinart Petit Gourmet Portable Tabletop Gas Grill\nIf you take pieces of Amazon, Home Depot, and Lowe's and put them all in a blender, you get Walmart. By that, I mean that you get a wide selection of products with multiple choices for purchases: in-store, ship-to-store, or fast shipping to home. Because of Walmart's reach, you can buy everything you need to start grilling, including the food, at the same time, in person or online.\nWith the one-stop convenience comes a few drawbacks. First, like the other big box stores, you need to know what you're looking for when shopping in-store. Staff work in multiple store sections and aren't authoritative on specific products. Walmart works with many brands online, and the item you're seeking may not get prominent website placement. There's nothing wrong with this model, but it may be confusing and time-consuming.\nShipping Cost: Free on most items\nShipping Time: Two to three days for most items\nReturn Policy: Items purchased or picked up at a store are eligible for return at the store. Online orders shipped to you are eligible for a return via mail.\nReturn Window: 90 days\nBass Pro Shops\n\nPros: Bass Pro has trained sales staff on-site and is a good representation of the best-reviewed brands.\nCons: Its offerings are less vast than other retailers, and the selection of grill tools is adequate but not great.\nA Product We Love: Coleman RoadTrip 285 Portable Stand-Up Propane Grill\nBass Pro Shops are monuments to all things outdoor recreation. This includes grilling and barbecuing, and an in-store visit can be a sensory overload of outdoor gear. But for those not close to a physical location, online shopping is available with an easy-to-navigate website with reasonable shipping and return policies. As they specialize in outdoor gear, sales staff are more knowledgeable than at some other retailers, so it's easy to find answers to your questions when shopping in-store. While not the deepest or broadest selection, Bass Pro Shops still carries many of the major and best-reviewed brands of grills and smokers on the market today. Its tool selection is adequate, and it stocks several brands of charcoal and smoker chips to get the fire going. It also stocks over 100 seasoning and rub options for all types of outdoor-cooked foods.\nShipping Cost: Free shipping for orders over $50 and $5 for orders under that amount.\nShipping Time: Four to six business days on most orders\nReturn Policy: You can exchange or request a refund on online or in-store items. Return shipping is free for defective merchandise or incorrect orders.\nReturn Window: 60 days\nDick's Sporting Goods\n\nPros: Dick's provides good in-store service with multiple online shopping and delivery options.\nCons: Compared to some, the number of brands carried is low, and there's a limited selection of accessories available.\nA Product We Love: Traeger Apple BBQ Wood Pellets\nDick's is another good crossover between brick-and-mortar and online shopping. Like others in the non-big-box category, it specializes in sporting goods and outdoor equipment and has knowledgeable sales staff to assist you in person. It's limited in the number of brands it carries but has a good selection within those brands. Online shopping is easy and intuitive, with available home delivery, store pickup, and ship-to-store options.\nThere are certainly places with a greater pool of options, but the tradeoff is personal service with many of those. The in-store availability and shipping options increase its rating, countering most downsides.\nShipping Cost: Free shipping on orders over $65 for regular sales, free shipping on orders over $49 for members, and $25 for other orders. Same-day delivery is available on some items when ordered within a certain time frame.\nShipping Time: Two to five business days\nReturn Policy: Items can be returned for exchange or refund with the receipt. Online returns are via mail or in-store.\nReturn Window: 90 days\nBrand Selection\nBrand selection counts in a big way if you're unsure about what brand you wish to buy. Stores and online retailers make agreements with manufacturers to carry certain brands, and you may wish to look at a wide variety of them before deciding. In this case, a retailer with a wide brand selection is to your benefit. If you're certain about a brand and model, pricing varies between retailers largely based on that retailer's sales volume and manufacturer's agreem",

    "excerpt": "When President Joe Biden signed the $369 billion Inflation Reduction Act in August, supporters hailed the measure as the largest climate investment in the nation's history -- but questions remained\u2026",
    "summary": "When President Joe Biden signed the $369 billion Inflation Reduction Act in August, supporters hailed the measure as the largest climate investment in the nation's history -- but questions remained about what the spending would ultimately achieve.\nThe majority of the funding took the form of tax credits meant to incentivize private investment in clean energy, such as wind and solar, and in theory, boost U.S. production of renewables as the nation pursues ambitious carbon emissions goals and a supply chain less dependent on China.\nThe success of the strategy, however, in a large part hinged on the willingness of companies to pursue those tax credits. So far, dozens of firms have announced projects that qualify for government relief, totaling more than $40 billion in clean energy investment and adding nearly 7,000 jobs, according to a report from Clean Power America, an industry group representing green energy companies.\nNew plans range from a battery manufacturing plant in Georgia to a solar complex in Alabama to the expansion of a wind turbine facility in Colorado, the report found.\nAs the global supply chain struggles to recover from the pandemic, the early wave of investment proves the wisdom of the landmark energy law, foretelling significant growth for U.S. clean energy and easing the sector's reliance on China, some industry representatives and analysts said.\nMORE: Oil company chief's appointment to lead COP28 climate conference sparks backlash\nBut some climate experts cautioned that the tens of billions in investment makes up a fraction of the scale required, leaving the effectiveness of the environmental measure in question. The law left out key parts of the climate change fight that could imperil carbon emissions goals regardless of the amount of investment, they added.\n\"Friction in the global economy is causing difficulties getting solar panels and lithium batteries,\" David Victor, a professor of innovation and public policy at the University of California, San Diego, told ABC News. \"It's hard to deploy the commitments we've made, let alone bring a radical expansion.\"\n\"This is a massive amount of money behind that ambition that we've never seen before in American history,\" he added.\nTo be sure, a host of industry groups and economists opposed the Inflation Reduction Act altogether, warning that the billions in spending would exacerbate inflation rather than alleviate it. Congressional Republicans tried to obstruct the law with a party-line \"no\" vote.\n'We share the goal of addressing climate change,\" the American Petroleum Institute, a trade group representing about 600 companies in the oil and natural gas industry said in a letter to House leaders before the law's passage. \"The considerable tax increases and new government spending in the IRA amount to the wrong policies at the wrong time.'\nLast decade, the use of renewable electricity in the U.S. skyrocketed. Between 2011 and 2020, the U.S. quadrupled the share of electricity it gets from wind and solar, according to a report from the nonprofit Environment America Research and Policy Center and the nonpartisan research organization Frontier Group.\nOver the first six months of 2022, nearly a quarter of U.S. electricity generation came from renewable sources, according to the Energy Information Administration, a government agency. But the progress falls well short of the Biden administration's goal of 100% clean electricity by 2035.\nThe need for additional U.S. clean energy capacity has drawn attention to the nation's renewables manufacturing sector, which pales in comparison to China, the source of more than 80% of components in all of the key stages of solar production, the International Energy Agency said in July.\nMORE: Tech layoffs 2023: Companies that have made cuts\nAs global supply chain bottlenecks amid the pandemic have weighed on China's economy and hindered U.S. access to key parts, the need for a fix has gained added urgency, some analysts said.\n\"Frankly, we've seen a slowdown,\" John Hensley, vice president for research and analytics at American Clean Power, told ABC News. \"The inability to source solar modules is front and center.\"\nThe three-month period ending in September marked the slowest quarter for renewable energy growth in three years, a report from American Clean Power found. Wind installations fell 78% compared with the previous quarter, while solar installations dropped 23%, the report showed.\nBy dramatically expanding U.S. clean energy production, the Inflation Reduction Act, or IRA, will help the nation circumvent a fragile global supply chain and return it to a trajectory of robust growth, industry representatives and some analysts said.\nA pronounced impact is expected in the solar market. The law will lead to over $600 billion in new investment over the next decade, bringing 50% more solar investment than the country would've drawn without the measure, the Solar Energy Industry Association found.\nHanwha Qcells, a Korean solar company, announced earlier this month more than $2.5 billion in new investment to build a manufacturing facility about 50 miles northwest of Atlanta. The company said it will also expand an existing plant in Dalton, Georgia, bringing a total of 2,500 new jobs.\nMORE: Collection of voice data for profit raises privacy fears\n\"The U.S. solar manufacturing industry has really struggled over the last couple decades,\" Scott Moskowitz, senior director, head of market strategy and public affairs at Qcells North America, told ABC News. \"The IRA marks a turning point in the history of the industry.\"\nThe Republican party, whose members on Capitol Hill uniformly opposed the energy law, retains one-party control of Georgia's state legislature. But government officials in the state have backed the solar project, Moskowitz said.\n\"We've had nothing but support from our elected officials,\" he said. \"We've found there's universal support for manufacturing jobs and pretty wide support for a diversified and cleaner energy mix.\"\nDespite signs of success, some analysts warned that the investment so far remains far short of what the country will require to achieve its climate goals.\n\"It's definitely good,\" Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, told ABC News. \"The issue is we need much more.\"\nThe law hamstrings itself, Jacobson said, since it includes tax credits for what he says are unproven technologies like carbon capture, a way of reducing emissions at their source by trapping and storing carbon before it releases into the air. Such tax credits are \"basically taking money away from real solutions,\" he said.\nMORE: 'Extreme' drought status nearly eliminated in California in wake of atmospheric rivers\nThe market will limit the use of credits for technology that proves ineffective, limiting that potential waste, said Hensley, of American Clean Power.\n\"If you have a project that doesn't have great economics, that doesn't have a great production profile, that isn't delivering on goals and benefits, not many of those projects are going to get done,\" he said.\nWhile improving the output of clean energy, the IRA doesn't address the issue of fossil fuel consumption, Jacobson said. As long as cars, homes and offices use fossil fuels, the benefits of clean energy will prove limited, he said.\n\"The IRA isn't addressing that problem of getting rid of fossil fuels,\" he said. \"The big problem is we need to stop burning things.\"\nHensley acknowledged that the climate fight will require initiatives that extend beyond clean energy production.\n\"It will take a joint effort to get there,\" he said. \"The country has a good track record of rising to the occasion.\"\nBiden climate law spurred billions in clean energy investment.

    "summary": "(Bloomberg) -- Artificial intelligence has become the tech industry's shiny new toy, with expectations it'll revolutionize trillion-dollar industries from retail to medicine. But the creation of every new chatbot and image generator requires a lot of electricity, which means the technology may be responsible for a massive and growing amount of planet-warming carbon emissions.\n\nOne Bank Folds, Another Wobbles and Wall Street Asks If It's a Crisis\n\nPeter Thiel's Founders Fund Advises Companies to Withdraw Money From SVB\nIn Biden's Tax-the-Rich Budget, Capital-Gains Rates Near 45%\nWarner Bros. Delays \u2018Suicide Squad' Game Again to Add More Polish\nMicrosoft Corp., Alphabet Inc.'s Google and ChatGPT maker OpenAI use cloud computing that relies on thousands of chips inside servers in massive data centers across the globe to train AI algorithms called models, analyzing data to help them 'learn' to perform tasks. The success of ChatGPT has other companies racing to release their own rival AI systems and chatbots or building products that use large AI models to deliver features to anyone from Instacart shoppers to Snap users to CFOs.\nAI uses more energy than other forms of computing, and training a single model can gobble up more electricity than 100 US homes use in an entire year. Yet the sector is growing so fast \u2014 and has such limited transparency \u2014 that no one knows exactly how much total electricity use and carbon emissions can be attributed to AI. The emissions could also vary widely depending on what type of power plants provide that electricity; a data center that draws its electricity from a coal or natural gas-fired plant will be responsible for much higher emissions than one that draws power from solar or wind farms.\nWhile researchers have tallied the emissions from the creation of a single model, and some companies have provided data about their energy use, they don't have an overall estimate for the total amount of power the technology uses. Sasha Luccioni, a researcher at AI company Hugging Face Inc., wrote a paper quantifying the carbon impact of her company's BLOOM, a rival of OpenAI's GPT-3. She has also tried to estimate the same for OpenAI's viral hit ChatGPT, based on a limited set of publicly available data.\n'We're talking about ChatGPT and we know nothing about it,' she said. 'It could be three raccoons in a trench coat.'\nGreater Transparency\nResearchers like Luccioni say we need transparency on the power usage and emissions for AI models. Armed with that information, governments and companies may decide that using GPT-3 or other large models for researching cancer cures or preserving indigenous languages is worth the electricity and emissions, but writing rejected Seinfeld scripts or finding Waldo is not.\nGreater transparency might also bring more scrutiny; the crypto industry could provide a cautionary tale. Bitcoin has been criticized for its outsized power consumption, using as much annually as Argentina, according to the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index. That voracious appetite for electricity prompted China to outlaw mining and New York to pass a two-year moratorium on new permits for crypto-mining powered by fossil fuels.\nTraining GPT-3, which is a single general-purpose AI program that can generate language and has many different uses, took 1.287 gigawatt hours, according to a research paper published in 2021, or about as much electricity as 120 US homes would consume in a year. That training generated 502 tons of carbon emissions, according to the same paper, or about as much as 110 US cars emit in a year. That's for just one program, or 'model.' While training a model has a huge upfront power cost, researchers found in some cases it's only about 40% of the power burned by the actual use of the model, with billions of requests pouring in for popular programs. Plus, the models are getting bigger. OpenAI's GPT-3 uses 175 billion parameters, or variables, that the AI system has learned through its training and retraining. Its predecessor used just 1.5 billion.\nOpenAI is already working on GPT-4, plus models must be retrained regularly in order to remain aware of current events. 'If you don't retrain your model, you'd have a model that didn't know about Covid-19,' said Emma Strubell, a professor at Carnegie Mellon University who was among the first researchers to look into AI's energy issue.\nAnother relative measure comes from Google, where researchers found that artificial intelligence made up 10 to 15% of the company's total electricity consumption, which was 18.3 terawatt hours in 2021. That would mean that Google's AI burns around 2.3 terawatt hours annually, about as much electricity each year as all the homes in a city the size of Atlanta.\nNet-zero Pledges\nWhile the models are getting larger in many cases, the AI companies are also constantly working on improvements that make them run more efficiently. Microsoft, Google and Amazon \u2014 the biggest US cloud companies \u2014 all have carbon negative or neutral pledges. Google said in a statement that it's pursuing net-zero emissions across its operations by 2030, with a goal to run its office and data centers entirely on carbon-free energy. The company has also used AI to improve energy efficiency in its data centers, with the technology directly controlling cooling in the facilities.\nOpenAI cited work it has done to make the application programming interface for ChatGPT more efficient, cutting electricity usage and prices for customers. 'We take our responsibility to stop and reverse climate change very seriously, and we think a lot about how to make the best use of our computing power,' an OpenAI spokesperson said in a statement. 'OpenAI runs on Azure, and we work closely with Microsoft's team to improve efficiency and our footprint to run large language models.'\nMicrosoft noted it is buying renewable energy and taking other steps to meet its previously announced goal of being carbon negative by 2030. 'As part of our commitment to create a more sustainable future, Microsoft is investing in research to measure the energy use and carbon impact of AI while working on ways to make large systems more efficient, in both training and application,' the company said in a statement.\nRead more: ChatGPT Microsoft Deal Highlights AI's Need for Computing Power\n'Obviously these companies don't like to disclose what model they are using and how much carbon it emits,' said Roy Schwartz, professor at Hebrew University of Jerusalem, who partnered with a group at Microsoft to measure the carbon footprint of a large AI model.\nThere are ways to make AI run more efficiently. Since AI training can happen at any time, developers or data centers could schedule the training for times when power is cheaper or at a surplus, thereby making their operations more green, said Ben Hertz-Shargel of energy consultant Wood Mackenzie. AI companies that train their models when power is at a surplus could then tout that in their marketing. 'It can be a carrot for them to show that they're acting responsibly and acting green,' Hertz-Shargel said.\n'It's going to be bananas'\nMost data centers use graphics processing units or GPUs to train AI models and those components are among the most power hungry the chip industry makes. Large models require tens of thousands of GPUs, with the training program ranging from weeks to months, according to a report published by Morgan Stanley analysts earlier this month.\nOne of the bigger mysteries in AI according to Luccioni, the researcher, is the total carbon emissions associated with GPUs. Nvidia, the biggest manufacturer of GPUs, said that when it comes to AI tasks, they can complete the task more quickly, making them more efficient overall.\n'Using GPUs to accelerate AI is dramatically faster and more efficient than CPUs \u2014 typically 20x more energy efficient for certain AI workloads, and up to 300x more efficient for the large language models that are essential for generative AI,' the company said in a statement.\nWhile Nvidia has disclosed its direct emissions and the indirect ones related to energy, it hasn't revealed all of the emissions they are indirectly response for, said Luccioni, who asked for that data for her research.\nWhen Nvidia does share that information, Luccioni thinks it'll turn out that GPUs burn up as much as the total emissions of a small country. She said, 'It's going to be bananas.'\n Businessweek\n\nAmerica's $52 Billion Plan to Make Chips at Home Faces a Labor Shortage\n\n\n\n\u00a92023 Bloomberg L.P.",

    "excerpt": "Peter King opens his Scouting Combine notebook to reveal everything from which players who helped themselves the most, to who to keep an eye on and more.",
    "summary": "The Jeremiah takeaways. Three players who helped themselves at the Combine, per NFL Network's Daniel Jeremiah:\nC.J. Stroud, QB, Ohio State, 6-3, 214: 'Best pure passer in this draft, and he had what I'd call a graceful workout. I've been to workouts that are overpowering. Stroud was smooth and natural. He's a born thrower.'\nCalijah Kancey, DT, Pitt, 6-1, 281: 'Not often a player's taller than advertised at this event, but Kancey was. Delivered on the explosiveness we thought we'd see. In a passing league, a disruptive player like this won't get out of the first round.'\nCharlie Jones, WR, Purdue, 5-11, 175. 'Not a great receiver year, and he ran fast (4.43 seconds) and had a phenomenal overall workout. Might have worked himself into the third round.'\nSean Payton's busy. The two most interesting Denver Broncos factoids I learned at the combine:\nSean Payton hired a few of his former New Orleans employees for his new staff in Denver. There were two who he did not hire. His former administrative assistant/offensive assistant, Kevin Petry, was a valued aide to Payton, and the coach requested Petry to follow him to Denver. But when he put in a request with the Saints for Petry to join the Denver staff, New Orleans GM Mickey Loomis nixed it. Turns out Petry was too valuable to the Saints, and because it was a lateral move from one staff to the other, Loomis was within his rights to decline Payton's request to hire Petry. The other employee? 'I wanted to bring the hair stylist also,' said Payton. 'She is fantastic.' I think Payton was kidding. I'm pretty sure he was kidding.\nPayton told me he's going to put an old car front and center in the parking lot so that all players and coaches will see it. He said he'll have the rearview mirror plus the side mirrors removed from the car. As he said at the Combine, he wants his players and his new organization to look ahead, and not behind, at the nightmare that was the 2022 Broncos season. So if you see a stripped-down old jalopy alongside some very nice vehicles in the Broncos parking lot this season, you'll know why.\nTush push. I asked a lot of NFL people about the rugby-scrum type of formation the Eagles perfected last season. They were 37-of-41 on QB sneaks, many of which featured the quarterback being pushed from behind on short yardage. Sean Payton and Pete Carroll have each said if it remains legal, they intend on making it part of their playbook next season. For this 18-year-old offensive wrinkle to be outlawed, three-quarters of the league's owners would have to vote to change it. So the Eagles and only eight other teams would have to vote to keep it for it to survive. I think I've got a good feel of the thinking of the Competition Committee, and I believe the group is mostly against assisting the ball carrier. But how adamant will the committee be as the league meetings in Arizona, when rules proposals come up for a vote, get closer? That's the big question we don't know yet. If the committee believes it doesn't have a good chance to get support from 24 teams, it's likely not to put the measure to a vote. My feeling is getting 24 votes would be a stretch. Two things committee members don't like: One, this isn't a football play. Two, the potential for injury. It's only a matter of time before a defender acting as a projectile flies over the scrum and contacts a QB helmet-to-helmet with force, or a QB getting pushed by 450 pounds of pushers meets similar resistance from defensive tackles and separates a shoulder.\nQuote of the Combine on the issue. Chargers coach Brandon Staley doesn't consider this a very big deal, but he's not keen on the potential for injury. He told me: 'It's what the law of physics says. If there's a force coming from the offense, there will be an equal or greater response from the defense. And that's concerning.'\nOn Jalen Carter. Lots of authorities had the Georgia defensive tackle as the top prospect in the draft entering the Combine. But oddly and perhaps significantly, on the day Carter reported to the Combine, the Athens-Clarke County (Ga.) Police issued an arrest warrant for Carter for reckless driving and racing in connection with the car-accident deaths of a Georgia player and recruiting staffer. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Carter left the scene of the crime and then misled police about the case. Carter left the Combine, turned himself into authorities in Georgia, then returned to the Combine and participated in interviews with teams Thursday night. Why do I question the timing of it all? The accident happened on Jan. 15. Exactly 45 days later, on the day he reported to the signature pre-draft event, the police issued the arrest warrant; Carter's reputation and draft stock took a major hit. The seriousness of the charge\u2014which Carter denies\u2014could derail Carter's career if proven. Aside from the legalities, when this happened is just odd. If Carter was highly regarded by the program and the community, would the case have been handled like this, giving him a black eye on the day of his big job interviews instead of three days before or three days after? 'You're not the only one to think that,' one GM told me Friday. 'I believe it was absolutely calculated.' This, of course, comes on the heels of ESPN's Todd McShay saying there were character concerns about Carter. Carter's history at Georgia will be a story to be followed between now and draft weekend.\nFree-agency? Meh. Assuming Lamar Jackson and Daniel Jones are either franchised or signed by the start of free-agency next week, it's going to be a lean year for the unrestricted players without contracts. Philadelphia defensive tackle Javon Hargrave and corner James Bradberry, tackles Orlando Brown (KC) and Mike McGlinchey (Niners) and DBs Jamel Dean (Bucs) and Jordan Poyer (Bills) will be some of the sought-after ones in the early hours of the market. As one GM told me, this could be a year when teams hold their cash till the market settles.\nThe quarterbacks. Alabama's Bryce Young, the leader in the clubhouse to be the first QB picked, didn't work out here. C.J. Stroud (Ohio State), Anthony Richardson (Florida) and Will Levis (Kentucky) did. Stroud had a great throwing workout and Richardson had one of the most athletic workouts a quarterback at the Combine has ever had. Young is the most polished of the class, but he's 5-10 1/8, and that surely will give some teams pause. Kyler Murray was the same height, exactly, four years ago, but still went one overall. The difference is Young doesn't have the speed Murray has. 'Young is the most pro-ready, we think,' said one GM whose team has a quarterback need. 'But he doesn't have one premier trait. He's very good at a lot of things, but obviously he's small.' Young, to me, on his size: 'I definitely didn't shrink any time recently. I'm comfortable with myself. I'm confident in my abilities. There's a lot of people who have paved the way for smaller quarterbacks. A lot of people have done it at a really high level. Drew Brees, Russell Wilson are guys that definitely inspired me a lot growing up. It's a good source of inspiration for me.'\nDot dot dot. The Derek Carr market is lukewarm. At best. 'If there was a lot of love for him, he'd have been signed by now,' one GM said \u2026 A guy you've never heard of, a guy who probably won't be drafted in round one, had one of the intriguing Combines. A 282-pound Northwestern defensive lineman, Adetomiwa Adebawore, ran the fastest time ever for a player weighing more than 275 pounds, 4.49 seconds in the 40-yard dash. His production didn't match his starry Combine, so teams will go to work on him now\u2014but he likely will be a hot player in the next seven weeks \u2026 Three undergrads from the University of Toronto won the $20,000 first prize in the NFL's Big Data Bowl at the Combine. Eight groups were flown to Indianapolis to compete for the prize, asked to come up with new metrics using Next Gen Stats data to improve a specific part of game study. Hassaan Inayatali, Aaron White and Daniel Hocevar presented on quantifying pocket pressure and how it affects the quarterback \u2026 In a nine-day span beginning March 22 in Columbus, the four top quarterbacks will hold Pro Days. Then the hay will be in the barn for, in order, Stroud, Young, Levis and Richardson.\nRead more in Peter King's full Football Morning in America column\n originally appeared on NBCSports.com",

    "excerpt": "Trump campaigns in Waco, Texas, as he hopes to wrest early control of the presidential contest from Nikki Haley and other GOP White House aspirants.",
    "summary": "As he faces possible criminal indictment, former President Donald Trump resumes high-profile political rallies Saturday in\u00a0a unique place in the political world: Waco, Texas.\nWhile Trump is accused of possibly playing to extremists for scheduling the rally during the 30th anniversary of the deadly siege of the Branch Davidian religious sect\u00a0in Waco,\u00a0the ex-president has a variety of reasons for choosing a city and state that are important\u00a0in many political\u00a0ways.\nWaco is in the heart of\u00a0Trump country, Texas division;\u00a0a region of religious and anti-federal government conservatives very receptive to Trumpian politics. \u00a0It's also about as centrally located as you can get in Texas, within 200 miles of heavily Republican areas around Dallas-Fort Worth, Houston, Austin, and San Antonio.\n\"Waco is a reliable Republican area, with Republican representation at nearly every level,\" said Matt Mackowiak, a Texas-based Republican political strategist. \"Feels rural. Culturally very conservative. Very pro gun. Very socially conservative.\"\n\n\nWaco is home to Baylor University and Dr. Pepper,\u00a0and near the ranch in Crawford once owned by Republican President George W. Bush. Russia President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Jiang Zemin visited the area during the second Bush presidency.\nIn short, there are a lot of reasons for a Republican politician to visit Waco, although focus has turned to one: The\u00a01993 raid-and-fire that claimed more than 70 lives.\nIt has been three decades since agents from the\u00a0Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raided\u00a0the Branch Davidian compound and ran into a gun battle from the occupants. That began a 51-day standoff that ended with a tear gas raid and fire that destroyed the compound and left nearly 80 people dead.\nSome far-right conservatives regard the 1993 fiasco as a deadly example of federal power. One of them, Timothy McVeigh, retaliated by bombing the Oklahoma City federal bombing exactly two years later, on April 19, 1995.\n'I mean, they're still talking about Waco as kind of this touchstone where they can refer back to as an example of extreme government overreach,' said\u00a0Stuart Wright, the chair of the Department of Sociology at Lamar University in Beaumont, Texas.\nThe Trump event could\u00a0motivate white supremacists and anti-government extremists, as well as right-wing populists, evangelical Christians, and Christian nationalists who love the ex-president's style, said Wright and other analysts of the phenomenon.\n'If you wanted to put in brief what is the lasting effect of the arrival of Donald Trump into American politics it's bringing the most extreme bits of America into the mainstream,' said Lawrence Rosenthal, the chair of the Center for Right-Wing studies at the University of California Berkeley.\nTrump aides and allies said the Branch Davidian episode has nothing to do with the selection of Waco for Saturday's rally.\nIn a written statement, Trump's campaign said it chose Waco because Texas is a Super Tuesday primary state and the city is\u00a0as close a central location as you can find within the sprawl of Texas.\u00a0Waco is\u00a0within 200 miles or so of four major media markets: Dallas-Fort Worth; Houston, Austin and San Antonio.\nThe campaign added that the Waco Regional Airport has\u00a0the\u00a0right infrastructure to support a Trump rally. Throughout his political career, Trump has often held campaign stops at airports and used his airplane as a backdrop, whether\u00a0it was Air Force One or the current \"Trump Force One.\"\n'This is the ideal location to have as many supporters from across the state and in neighboring states attend this historic rally,' the campaign said.\nThere's also Texas itself: Republican Texas.\nA Democrat has not won statewide in Texas since 1994 (and that was a conservative Democrat, Lt. Gov. Bob Bullock). A Democratic presidential candidate has not claimed Texas since Jimmy Carter in 1976.\nThe growth of Republican Texas since World War II has many roots, including the\u00a0rise of the oil industry, resistance to civil rights and other federal legislation, and the rise of suburban voters. Gun rights are big in Texas, as are religious conservatives who oppose abortion.\nTexas has also been fertile ground for far-right political movements, from the John Birch society to QAnon.\nAnd while Trump faces possible indictment in New York City over hush-money payments, Texas Republicans have never been known to be fastidious about such things. Texas Attorney\u00a0General Ken Paxton won reelection last year despite being under indictment in a securities fraud case.\nLike Trump, Paxton denies the allegation.\nTrump is expected to use the Waco rally to attack the many investigations against him, and to ask supporters to protest them as well. In addition to the New York case, which involves payments to an alleged former mistress, Trump is being investigated in Atlanta and Washington, D.C., over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election.\nTrump has long claimed that the investigations are \"a witch hunt,\" and that messaging continues as the prospect of a criminal indictment lingers. His campaign's emails this week include mentions of a 'deep state,' and a\u00a0'globalist cabal,' language that echoes the QAnon conspiracy theory.\nIn a video posted this week, Trump told his followers, \"They're not coming after me. They're coming after you.\" In a Truth Social post, he\u00a0berated prosecutors for even considering indictments when it is \"known that potential death & destruction in such a false charge could be catastrophic for our Country.\"\nTrump may well use this rally for \"emboldening Far Right forces,\"\u00a0said Edward Miller,\u00a0 a Northeastern University history professor and author of a book called \"Nut Country: Right-Wing Dallas and the Birth of the Southern Strategy.\"\n\"Trump is using this to rally anti-government support,\" Miller said.\u00a0\"He just has an affinity with that element.\"\nTrump wouldn't be the first presidential candidate to make a play for the base like this.\nMiller and other analysts\u00a0pointed to\u00a0Ronald Reagan, who\u00a0kicked off his general election\u00a0campaign in August of 1980 by traveling\u00a0to a small town in central Mississippi,\u00a0despite criticism that his rally fell nearly 16 years to the day after the discovery of the bodies of three murdered civil rights workers.\nWaco also has large pockets of religious conservatives, a big part of Trump's political base.\nThe biggest example,\u00a0Baylor,\u00a0describes itself as a \"Private Christian University and a Nationally Ranked Research\u00a0Institution.\" The school's nationally ranked football and men's and women's basketball programs have also brought publicity to Waco.\nWright said Saturday's rally may be an opportunity to appeal to religious followers like evangelical Christians who already support him by a wide margin, and some Christian nationalists who 'are definitely in his camp.'\n'There's kind of this persecution complex within parts of the Christian community \u2014 they're being persecuted, complaining about taking Christ out of Christmas,' he said. 'But these are myths that appeal widely to these groups, and so Trump being a clever politician has always tried to exploit that. So any opportunity he sees, I'm sure he's going to take advantage of it.\"\nWhile Trump is calling for massive protests, many analysts are\u00a0skeptical the rally would turn violent. And one said the choice of venue could more be about annoying liberals than riling up extremists.\n'January 6th will not be reproduced, and there are a couple of reasons for that,' Rosenthal said. 'One is the consequences \u2014 not during the last two weeks of Donald Trump's administration but under the Biden Department of Justice \u2014 have been really severe, and in the simplest sense a lot of people who would have done violence are now in jail.'\nTrump is expected to give shout-outs at the Waco rally to local Republican leaders, though at least one will not be there. Pete Sessions, the local Republican Congressman and longtime Trump supporter, encouraged others to attend but cited a prior commitment in East Texas.\nNicole Hemmer, author of \"Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s\", said Trump specializes in 'triggering the libs' \u2013\u00a0which she defines as \"picking something you know will provoke outrage and draw media coverage.\"\nOne example was Trump's decision to hold a rally in Tulsa on June 19, 2020 - Juneteenth, the holiday marking the end of slavery, in a city noted for a 1921 massacre of Black people. Trump proceeded with the event after moving it back a day.\n\"It all fits together in anti-Washington themes,\" she said.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Donald Trump's first 2024 campaign rally is in Waco, Texas.

    "excerpt": "Feb. 1\u2014CUMBERLAND \u2014 The U.S. economy has about a two-thirds chance of experiencing a recession before the end of this year, a Kennesaw State University economist told businessmen and women Wednesday.\u2026",
    "summary": "Feb. 1\u2014CUMBERLAND \u2014 The U.S. economy has about a two-thirds chance of experiencing a recession before the end of this year, a Kennesaw State University economist told businessmen and women Wednesday.\nRoger Tutterow, an economics professor and director of the Econometric Center at KSU, said the economy would more than likely experience a \"mild correction\" in 2023 at Synovus bank's annual economic forecast breakfast at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre.\nTutterow displayed a graph with data from economic think tank The Conference Board that showed leading economic indicators on a downward trajectory. The index aggregates 10 series of data which \"turn up before expansions and down before recessions,\" in Tutterow's words.\nThe indicators have fallen for eight consecutive months, and the six-month moving average is down 4.2%.\n\"We have never had that significant of a drop in the (leading economic indicators) and not had a subsequent recession,\" Tutterow said.\nLast April, Tutterow said he forecasted a 30% risk of recession before the end of 2023. By August 2022, his forecasted risk had grown to 40%. By the end of last year, he had raised it to \"about two-thirds.\"\nHis advice to the crowd? Don't panic.\n\"I think it's fair to say that the risk of a recession over the next 12 months is elevated,\" Tutterow said. \"So we make some choices about maybe hoarding a little bit of cash, maybe not deploying capital as quickly as we might otherwise do.\n\"But what you can't do is allow what should be a relatively mild correction to pull you off your long-term strategic plan. You have to manage in a way that allows you to be a little bit more measured in activities that you take, particularly the first half of this year. But I do think you still need to be focused on the longer term outlook and creating comparative advantage, vis-a-vis your neighbors and your competitors.\"\nKevin Blair, president and CEO of Synovus, said that uncertain economic times can also present an opportunity for businesses.\n\"Warren Buffett said, and I steal his quote all the time, 'When those around you are greedy, it's time to be fearful,'\" Blair said. \"And so what we've had for the last 10 years of zero interest rates and free money, we had a lot of greedy people. And I think you had to be a little cautious and pragmatic as you take risks. But he also said 'When those around you are fearful, it's time to be greedy.' And what I think he meant was, when there are times of crisis, that's when market share changes hands.\"\nThe 'R' word\nThe specter of \"the dirty 'R' word \u2014 recession,\" was a main theme of Tutterow's talk.\nA recession is sometimes defined as two consecutive quarters of negative gross domestic product growth. That was seen in the first and second quarters of 2022, when GDP declined by 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively. In the third and fourth quarters of last year, the economy grew by 3.2% and 2.9%, respectively.\nTutterow said that the first half of last year did not, in fact, represent a recession, if you looked closely at the numbers, because most of the weakness was confined to the trade sector, which was still plagued by supply chain disruptions.\nThe last two quarters of strength, likewise, look better on paper than they actually were, he said, because much of the growth was due to the supply chain recovering, and product inventories correcting.\n\"So we really have been a little more sluggish than what the headline GDP numbers tell you,\" Tutterow said. \"Now, the other reason that is an issue is, if so much of our GDP was building up inventories in the fourth quarter of last year, that it means that as we get into 2023, we've got to get rid of those inventories. ... And when we do that, production and employment may well suffer.\"\nInflation\nThe leading economic indicators graph Tutterow displayed was one of more than 20 he employed in his presentation. And it was one of two he called \"really ugly.\"\nThe other one was the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey, which has declined steeply since spring 2021. The survey measures how consumers feel about the state of the economy.\nLeading that trend, he said, is the public's concern over gas prices.\n\"Our research says that fuel prices exert a disproportionate impact on perceptions of inflation,\" he said.\nGas prices have started to moderate in recent months. That's good news, not just for motorists, but for economic projections.\n\"Hopefully that will give us some rebuilding. Because if we do not get consumer sentiment back up in the normal range over the next several months, then the risk of recession remains elevated,\" Tutterow said.\nSpeaking about the main economic force making headlines in recent years, Tutterow said that inflation has moderated but \"is still too high.\"\nOne indicator of inflation, the consumer price index, last June was up 9.1% over 12 months. Last December, it was up only 6.5% over 12 months.\n\"Happy Days, only 6.5% percent inflation,\" Tutterow said sarcastically.\nInflation is moving in the right direction, though. Tutterow forecasted a consumer price index in the \"mid-to-high 3% range\" by the end of the year.\nBusinesses need to factor in inflation when looking at their books, Tutterow said. Because for 35 years, the U.S. had low inflation.\n\"And we forget that when you're in a higher inflation environment, your top line, your revenue, will go up, just because of inflation. Your cost will go up, reflecting inflation. And that bottom line net income may well rise, just because of inflation. ... You need to take your financial statements in your businesses ... (and) demarcate, was there an inflationary effect versus real growth, inside my enterprise,\" Tutterow said.\nThe Federal Reserve was expected to announce another interest rate increase Wednesday, the eighth increase since the start of 2022 intended to curb inflation.\nTutterow said interest rates may be higher than they were in recent decades, but they are still historically low. He expects them to peak around 5% later this year.\nThose rates mean that few people will be looking to refinance their mortgages, Tutterow said.\nIn a potential recession, Tutterow said there will be far fewer foreclosures than in the 2008 recession, because banks have been more cautious about loaning money for homes to borrowers.\nEmployment\nEmployers have consistently struggled to fill jobs since the pandemic started. Part of this, Tutterow said, can be attributed to a 1% reduction in the labor force.\nThere's roughly 2.5 million more jobs than there are people in the labor force, he said.\n\"Now, I don't know why they left. So I think the great resignation is real. Some people have opted out, and they're not going to return, at least until they open their 401(k) statements, and they may rethink it. But the point is, labor shortages are here to stay,\" Tutterow said.\nThe number of jobs in the U.S. recovered to pre-pandemic levels last August, and has remained above that level. Georgia is ranked 8th among states in post-COVID-19 job recovery.\nEven as investment banks and tech companies have made headlines with recent layoffs, Tutterow said there hasn't been a broad scale reduction in jobs in the U.S.\nReal estate\nHome prices skyrocketed during the pandemic, but Tutterow expects them to moderate this year. He said they could be down by about 15% by the fall, but still above pre-pandemic levels.\nIn the commercial real estate sector, Tutterow thinks metro Atlanta may have had some overbuilding in multifamily housing, and apartment occupancy might dip soon.\nHotel construction is recovering from the pandemic as business travel picks up again, he said.\nTutterow said that hybrid work, too, is here to stay. When looking back on the pandemic, \"we're going to be talking about the voluntary behavioral changes that came about in the pandemic and never went away.\"\nThat also has implications for commercial real estate.\n\"How we work, how we live, how we shop is here to stay. And I don't see how that doesn't have some effect on the office market,\" Tutterow said.",

    "summary": "Bed Bath & Beyond announced it will close 87 more stores nationwide as the embattled home goods chain teeters on the brink of bankruptcy.\nIn addition, the company said it would close five buybuy Baby stores and all locations of its beauty store brand, Harmon. The retailer said the new closures expand an ongoing program to close 150 of its lowest-performing stores. It had previously announced the shuttering of 62 stores in September, and 56 more in January.\nThirty states are impacted by the latest announcement. Florida will shed the most Bed Bath & Beyond stores in the latest wave with 11 stores closing, followed by California with 10. Harmon stores are mostly concentrated in New York and New Jersey.\nThe retailer said in its third quarter results report earlier this month that it had seen net sales drop 33% to $1.26 billion, and announced an expected $500 million in general annualized cost cuts.\nExperts: Gas prices have jumped for five straight weeks and are 'unlikely' to drop soon\nEasy target?

    "summary": "With the NBA All-Star break over, teams are heading into the final stretch of the 2022-23 regular season with around 23 or so games remaining.\nWith that in mind, Yahoo Sports' NBA staff resets its preseason predictions for a number of awards, late-playoff matchups and what will be the most interesting storylines heading into the postseason.\nDan Devine: Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets\nJake Fischer: Joel Embiid, Philadelphia 76ers\nVincent Goodwill: Giannis Antetokounmpo, Milwaukee Bucks\nBen Rohrbach: Nikola Jokic, Denver Nuggets\nDan Devine: Paolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\nJake Fischer: Paolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\nVincent Goodwill: Paolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\nBen Rohrbach: Paolo Banchero, Orlando Magic\nDan Devine: Mike Brown, Sacramento Kings\nJake Fischer: Joe Mazzulla, Botson Celtics\nVincent Goodwill: Mike Brown, Sacramento Kings\nBen Rohrbach: Joe Mazzulla, Botson Celtics\nDan Devine: Denver Nuggets vs. Golden State Warriors\nJake Fischer: Denver Nuggets vs. Golden State Warriors\nVincent Goodwill: Phoenix Suns vs Golden State Warriors\nBen Rohrbach: Denver Nuggets vs. Phoenix Suns\nDan Devine: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Boston Celtics\nJake Fischer: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Boston Celtics\nVincent Goodwill: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Boston Celtics\nBen Rohrbach: Milwaukee Bucks vs. Boston Celtics\nDan Devine: Bucks vs. Warriors\nJake Fischer: Nuggets vs. Bucks\nVincent Goodwill: Bucks vs. Suns\nBen Rohrbach: Celtics vs. Nuggets\nDan Devine: The (all but certainly, he said, knocking on wood) playoff-bound Sacramento Kings!\nJake Fischer: Sacramento Kings\nVincent Goodwill: Sacramento Kings\nBen Rohrbach: Golden State Warriors (More on this in a second ...)\nDan Devine: The Toronto Raptors, who I thought had a chance to be legit good, but turned out to be aggressively mid.\nJake Fischer: Los Angeles Clippers\nVincent Goodwill: Los Angeles Lakers\nBen Rohrbach: Golden State Warriors ... It is mind-bending to consider the Golden State Warriors are .500 with 24 games to play in the regular season, in danger of missing the playoffs entirely, and yet no team would want to face them if they make it. How can they be so dangerous but so average?\nIt's that championship DNA, I guess \u2014 the mundanity of the regular season after winning four titles in six Finals appearances over eight years. The Warriors have one fewer loss than the Portland Trail Blazers, and Draymond Green is on Twitter claiming, 'Told y'all they can't beat us,' when the starting five is together.\nThat starting five \u2014 Stephen Curry, Klay Thompson, Andrew Wiggins, Kevon Looney and Green \u2014 is outscoring opponents by 21.9 points per 100 possessions, easily the best of any NBA unit that has played 300 minutes, but they are also 14-13 in games they have been on the floor together. That speaks to a lack of depth, and trading a recent No. 2 overall pick to reacquire an injured Gary Payton II (who they could have just re-signed this past summer) is an admission of that fault. The Warriors won't need as much depth in the playoffs, but first they have to get there, and get there with enough gas left in the tank to win four rounds.\nDan Devine: With all due respect to the recent shake-ups out West \u2014 KD to Phoenix! Kyrie to Dallas! Half a team to the Lakers! \u2014 I think we should be keeping an eye on whether the Bucks can overtake the Celtics for the top seed in the East. Boston's been in pole position since the season tipped off. But Milwaukee's got the better record and net rating since the calendar flipped to 2023, has been lights out since Giannis Antetokounmpo and Khris Middleton got healthy, finally added their hoped-for missing piece in Jae Crowder, and has a slightly softer post-All-Star break schedule than the C's.\nMany public-facing playoff projection systems see Jayson Tatum and Co. holding off the Bucks' charge. It's notable to me, though, that Mike Beuoy's model at Inpredictable \u2014 which seeks to 'reverse-engineer an implied power ranking from the Vegas point spreads [and] figure out who the betting market \u2018thinks' are the best teams in the league' \u2014 pegs Milwaukee as the team with the higher likelihood of finishing with the No. 1 seed. Given how good these teams are in their own gyms and how slim the margins between them are, home-court advantage could matter a ton \u2026 which is why this 20-odd-game sprint bears close watching. (Also: If Milwaukee finishes first, Mr. 'Unseen Fr34ky Hours' over here might have something to say to the big Serbian fella about that MVP race.)\nJake Fischer: The power struggle atop the Western Conference will be something to behold. Denver is well-positioned to emerge as the No. 1 seed, but how hot will the Suns burn after Kevin Durant returns from injury? Can the Memphis Grizzlies play their villain card perfectly, and make do on Ja Morant's claims of being \"good\" in the conference? Will the Clippers find stability? Can Golden State regroup once Stephen Curry returns? How will the Wolves look with Karl-Anthony Towns back in the mix? Top to bottom, the entire conference is facing critical questions.\nVincent Goodwill: Seeing if the champion Warriors can find some level of consistency when Stephen Curry returns. They don't want to be in the play-in tournament and will have to put on a rush to get there.\nBen Rohrbach: Kevin Durant on the Phoenix Suns. Durant, Devin Booker and Chris Paul give the Suns three of the deadliest crunch-time playmakers in the league, and Deandre Ayton should not be an afterthought in any discussion about how deadly Phoenix can be, even if they do not have many players beyond them you can reliably trust in a big playoff moment.\nThey are going to be a ton of fun to watch, especially to see how quickly they can develop their on-court chemistry. Durant fits into any system as well as any superstar who has ever lived, but there are 23 games left on the schedule, and he has not played since Jan. 8. Paul and Booker have also missed significant time with injuries that could linger for the remainder of the season. How they walk the fine line of creating a cohesive unit and maintaining their health could determine which team is left standing at the end of the season.\nDan Devine: The Nuggets were right to bet on the brief glimpse of their team they saw before Jamal Murray blew out his knee. Zion Williamson could elevate the Pelicans to another level (when he's healthy, at least). 'Maybe everything finally breaks right in Brooklyn. It seems equally likely, though, that everything finally just breaks.'\nJake Fischer: The Kings are good! Keegan Murray is not quite the Rookie of the Year candidate I predicted, but he's been a super-valuable fifth starter in Sacramento, shooting over 40% from distance as Domantas Sabonis and De'Aaron Fox's All-Star campaigns have the Kings entering the break as an improbable No. 3 seed. Never did I think Sacramento would end its postseason drought with home-court advantage in the playoffs, but we believed in the talent assembled in Cowbell Kingdom, and Mike Brown has done an excellent job piloting it all from the sideline.\nVincent Goodwill: That the Brooklyn Nets would be a mess. Coach gone, transcendent star gone, Kyrie Irving gone, Ben Simmons remains.\nBen Rohrbach: Let me count the ways, my friends. None of the NBA's old guard is among the league's leading MVP candidates. The Atlanta Hawks, Minnesota Timberwolves, New Orleans Pelicans and even the Cleveland Cavaliers seem like they did enough to be just not good enough. The Celtics look more likely than the Warriors to return to the Finals. There's even still hope for Luka Doncic to rise to the top of the MVP discussion and for the Los Angeles Clippers to emerge as title contenders.\nBut no prediction in our 'Hot Takes We Might Actually Believe' series was more spot-on than calling Kevin Durant's Brooklyn Nets more combustible than LeBron James' Los Angeles Lakers. It was a battle for the first three months of the season, and the Lakers are in 13th place out West, but the Nets still won the war. Kyrie Irving's trade request imploded the team. They dealt him, then Durant, and now they are no more.",

    "summary": "\u2014 A Focus on New Resources & Attached Services has Delivered on the Potential of the 'BFG' Initiative, Positioning the Distributor for Success in 2023 \u2014\nHARRISBURG, Pa., Feb. 27, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- D&H Distributing, a major provider of SMB, mid-market, and consumer technologies to the North American channel, announced it saw significant growth in key focus areas in 2022 including business applications, infrastructure, security and collaboration; as well as professional services, in the wake of the launch of its Modern Solutions Business Unit. This shift addresses technology consumption models like cloud and XaaS. Such high performances also come a little more than a year after D&H introduced its BFG ('Built for Growth, Giving, and Generations') initiative, designed to expand the distributor's ability to deliver transformative, modern solutions and strategies to its mid-market and SMB channel partner base.\nD&H experienced triple-digit performance in several of these categories last year, including 102% sales growth in Modern Applications and Cloud Services; plus 264% growth of D&H's new managed services offering, under its Professional Services portfolio. Other high-growth stats: The distributor saw a 39% increase in sales from its Modern Solutions Business Unit overall; 216% growth in Project Services; 66% growth in Integration Services; plus a 46% increase in sales of Cisco products. All figures are year-over-year.\nInvesting in Growth\nD&H has also made notable investments in services and programs to position the company for ongoing growth in 2023. This includes its new in-house TechDrive Creative Studios marketing services arm, which provides full agency offerings customized specifically for the unique needs of each partner. It also includes new and/or revitalized vendor resources like the recently-launched Cisco Partner Enablement (CPE) self-service platform, new professional services from Microsoft and Google, and other investments. The details are as follows:\nLaunch of TechDrive Creative Studios: This is D&H's new marketing services division, which delivers no-cost consultation as well as a comprehensive portfolio of creative planning, design, and production across all media. TechDrive's experts are versed in the industry and tech and can help partners to procure and utilize marketing resources and MDF (market development funds) to generate demand, helping them to better market specific technologies. Partners can contract for creation and development of digital marketing, web site, video, sales assets, and marketing campaign toolkits, or take advantage of more comprehensive concierge services. Looking forward into 2023, the division is developing a set of dynamic marketing automation tools to streamline the execution of partners' go-to-market needs. More information is available at www.techdrivestudios.com\nLaunch of Cisco Partner Enablement (CPE) Platform: D&H's new CPE platform provides a frictionless yet comprehensive way for partners to manage their Cisco business. The platform provides automated product catalog and sku attributes as well as order information including status, estimated delivery dates, tracking information and product serial numbers with 'one-click' requests. Partners can also manage the renewal and contract lifecycle processes using CPE, and D&H is introducing pricing and proposal generation functionality in early 2023.\nThe CPE platform demonstrates D&H's commitment to help increase its partners' Cisco business, which contributed to the 41% growth in sales of these branded solutions in 2022. The MSP-inspired D&H Cloud Marketplace powers a robust portfolio of Cisco cloud solutions. D&H added a number of new Cisco cloud products in 2022 including Secure Endpoint (AMP), Stealthwatch, Webex, and Secure Email Threat Defense, and was the first distributor to offer renewal support for the Cisco Duo and Umbrella solutions.\nExpansion of SuccessPath Program: D&H's popular SuccessPath technical training and business transformation offering has branched out to address the company's greater Modern Solutions portfolio. What began as 'SuccessPath to Cloud' has spawned parallel programs in other strategic areas including Modern Security, Modern Collaboration, Modern Infrastructure, and Modern Applications and Devices. These programs offer tactical, step-by-step training\u2014both on-line and in person\u2014on how to develop and improve partner practices in these categories. Its resources are designed to increase the partner's competencies in professional and managed services, complement their solution offerings, and optimize their profitability.\nSuccessPath Premier is an enhanced version of this offering, recently developed for members of D&H's Partnerfi partner engagement community, which has seen outstanding success. For example: Partnerfi members have experienced an uptick in cloud solutions sales of 210% since the program's launch in January of 2022.

    "excerpt": "Invisible ink is one of the most popular methods to send secret messages, created with recipes using substances like milk, lemon juice, or urine.",
    "summary": "Humans have had a long history with sending secret messages.\nThe practice dates back to ancient Greeks tattooing a servant's head to a modern-day employee stealing corporate secrets.\nInvisible ink is one of the most popular methods, created using various substances like milk, lemon juice, or urine.\nSecret messages have been sent for thousands of years.\nFolklore tells of enslaved people using methods like hair braiding to secretly communicate without their slave owners knowing, while old women have hung laundry or knitted the routes of trains during wars to help resistance fighters.\nMore recently, prisoners and employees have tried to break rules and laws \u2014 and even put out hits on staff \u2014 by sending secret messages.\nHere are a number of ways people have sent secret messages over the centuries.\nOne of the first secret messages in history reportedly traveled on a servant's skull in 513 BC. Greek tyrant Histiaeus shaved his servant's head before tattooing a secret message \u2014 that the Persian army led by King Darius was planning an attack \u2014 to the man's head.\nThey had to wait for the hair to grow back before the messenger was sent to the Greeks, who shaved his head again to read the message.\nThis was one of the first instances of steganography, a process of hiding a message in an otherwise innocent-looking person or object.\nSources: New York Times, Wired\nAround the 16th century, folklorists believe enslaved people in Colombia may have used hair braiding to hide secret messages. For instance, if an enslaved person wanted to escape they would tie their hair into thick, tight braids close to the scalp with the ends tied into buns.\nThis means of messaging is according to a woman named Ziomara Asprilla Garcia, who told the story during a folk festival in 2011.\nShe said enslaved people also curved their braids to indicate what roads they planned to take after they escaped.\nSource: Washington Post\nRumors have lingered that enslaved people in America used quilts to send messages to help escapees using the Underground Railroad, although it's difficult to verify these claims.\nPatricia Turner, a professor of African American Studies at the University of California, Los Angeles, told Snopes they were urban legends, but they were \"ultimately very true\" in her mind.\nSource: Snopes\nDuring the American Revolution, a woman named Ann Strong who lived in Long Island reportedly used laundry to send coded messages to spies working for George Washington, who was then Commander in Chief of the Continental Army.\nThis occurred during the British occupation of parts of Long Island and Staten Island.\nIt was a simple system that the soldiers didn't notice. If a message was ready to be picked up she hung a black petticoat on her line.\nShe would then hang a number of pieces in a certain order and that order told whoever was watching where they were going to meet.\nSources: History.com, Science History\nAt the same time, invisible ink played a role in secret messages being sent to Washington. According to a letter from 1776, one type of invisible ink was invented by an English doctor named Sir James Jay, the brother of Supreme Court Chief Justice John Jay.\nAccording to his letter, he had a method for his correspondence.\nTo avoid suspicion, he wrote short letters to his brother and a few others, leaving the rest of the page black. He then filled these blank spaces with intelligence information he thought might be useful, writing it with his invisible ink.\nSources: New York Times Archive, Science History\nDuring the American Civil War, Elizabeth Van Lew, a well-off woman from Virginia, secretly worked for the Union. She brought prisoners food and medication, as well as sneaking messages into books and in a secret compartment of a custard dish.\nLater in the war, she started writing messages to Union soldiers in a clear liquid that turned black when milk was added.\nSource: Smithsonian Magazine\nDuring World War I, both the CIA and the Germans came up with their own concoctions for invisible ink.\nThe CIA released several of its old recipes in 2011, including one which was 3.4 ounces of water plus three grams of copper sulfate and potassium bromide. The Germans used a mixture of powdered aspirin and water.\nSource: Wired\nDuring World War II, knitting had its day as a form of covert messaging. In German-occupied Belgium, the resistance had women who lived beside railway lines to knit the order of trains into the clothing to keep track of the enemy's movements.\nIt was simple work, like a hole made by a dropped stitch signifying that a train had passed, or a purl stitch, which created a bump, meant another type of train had been by.\nSources: Telegraph, Lithub\nAnd at least one Belgian woman used invisible ink on her back to transport information during the war.\nInvisible ink was used again in 1943 to send what appeared to be a love letter from a woman in Krak\u00f3w to a man in Romania, but it was actually providing information about concentration camps.\nTo the naked eye, the letter said: \"My darling, I remember you with love.\"\nBut if you heated the postcard with a hot iron, the real letter said, \"Death camp, the rest deceit.\"\nThis was followed by a series of words, including \"starvation, torture chamber, terror, killing by gas, gallows, murder, incinerator, agonizing hell, children of four and under.\"\nSource: Independent\nThe less-sophisticated method of lemon juice had its day, too. Two spies, a German man named Carl Muller and an English man named John Hahn, reported the movements of British Troops by writing to their government from Britain using invisible ink made with lemon juice.\nWhen the pair were caught and their houses were searched, the police found a lemon filled with holes as well as a pen nib ruined by citric acid.\nThe lemon Muller used is still stored in the British National Archives.\nSources: Science History, National Geographic\nThere was even one instance where four imprisoned Polish Girl Guides in a concentration camp called Ravensbruck used their urine to send secret letters.\nThey told their families about what was going on in the camp, including details about horrific testing by the Nazis, as they experimented with infectious diseases.\nThe girls asked that in return, they signal that they were receiving the messages by including a blue thread in the package they sent back.\nSource: First News, Reuters\nIt was also during World War II that the Germans started using a technique called microdots. J. Edgar Hoover said it was \"the enemy's masterpiece of espionage.\"\nThese messages were shrunk down to the size of a period.\nThese messages were so small \u2014 shrunk up to 200 times \u2014 most of the time you had to know about them before you could find them.\nSources: New York Times, BBC, BBC, Vice\nIn 1968, American prisoners of war captured by North Korean forces started sending not-so-subtle messages by raising their middle fingers. It was a way to show their rebellion and to keep their humor.\nThe sign wasn't recognized by the North Koreans so the message went right over their heads.\nSources: Vice, Atlas Obscura\nBack in America, the secret messages continued. Prisoners began to use them, though their messages were often more advanced than using invisible ink mae of milk, lemon, or urine.\nIn 2018, Insider reported on the secret codes some prisoners were using.\nThese included writing hidden messages using every fifth word, substituting letters in what's known as a substitution cipher, or using a telephone number cipher so that letters indicated phone numbers.\nOne letter that was intercepted requested a hit on one of the prison staff at Fulton County Jail in Atlanta.\nSource: Insider\nIn 1999, there were reports that scientists had taken the idea of microdots and used it to hide secrets in DNA. This strategy was more reflective of what scientists were capable of doing rather than signaling the future of hidden messages.\nSource: New York Times\nAs for modern secret messages, most of it takes place on computers. A common way to do it is to hide messages in digital photographs. In 2018, a low-resolution sunset made headlines when a GE employee tried to hide corporate secrets in emails he sent to himself with nothing but the photo attached.\nThe former employee Xiaoqing Zheng was charged \u2014 and later found guilty \u2014 of conspiracy to commit espionage. He was accused of attempting to steal 20,000 electronic files from GE about its turbine technology.\nIn the emails he sent to himself with the photo, he wrote: \"nice view to keep.\"\nSources: Vice, CNBC, Science History\nRead the original article on Insider",

    "summary": "Getty Images\nWhether you whip up delicious meals in a tiny apartment kitchen (raises hand) or have a sprawling kitchen island in your countryside home, organizing a kitchen can be really tough. Especially because there are so many pots, pans, utensils, and food that must be used and consumed while creating a delectable dish.\nBelow, we've asked two organizing experts for the typical kitchen organization mistakes they see with their clients, and various ways they guide clients on how to fix them.\n1. Storing things that you use every day up high or in hard-to-reach places.\n'Anything you use frequently in your kitchen should be easy to access to save you time and gain efficiency throughout your day,' explains Audra George, a professional organizer and owner of Pretty Neat: An Organization Solution in Oklahoma City, OK.\nWhen the space's functionality is thought out and our routines are consequently streamlined, we have more respect for the space and are more inclined to maintain the neatness of the space, explains Crimsyn Hawk, a professional organizer and owner of Spaced Organization in Atlanta, GA. 'Your kitchen needs to be arranged in a way that makes sense for you and how you operate in it on a regular basis.'\nIf that means your cooking grains and baking flours live in a cabinet to the left of your stove because you use them often and that location makes most sense to your routines, so be it. 'Just because a magazine displays kitchen storage one way, does not mean that storage solution is the best one for you,' explains Hawk. 'It's important to take some time and figure out what your ideal storage layout looks like, and then you can go through and make the systems pretty from there.'\n2. Keeping unnecessary duplicates.\n'I can definitely justify having two (or even three) sets of measuring cups, as those are items that get dirty quickly and it's beneficial to have more than one set while baking or cooking large meals,' explains Hawk. 'However, there isn't much reason for having two or three can openers. It's ideal that we only keep what we need for our routines and tendencies.'\nIn doing that, we can store our items neater in our drawers without excess items piling up around them. 'When we store our items neater, they're easier to find, simpler to access, and quicker to put away in a neat manner (so the cycle can seamlessly continue),' says Hawk.\n3. Storing holiday dishes and items that are rarely used in prime spaces in your kitchen.\nAccording to George, you don't want to allow rarely used items to take up prime real estate in your kitchen storage. 'Store these items up high and out of the way until you need them,' she suggests.\n4. Stacking your pots, pans, and baking sheets.\nAccording to Hawk, most kitchens she works in have at least one tall, deep cabinet. 'This is the first thing I look for during a kitchen consultation when the client has their pot and pan set or baking sheets and dishes stacked on top of each other,' she says. 'With a deep cabinet, we can install an adjustable rack that holds the pans vertically, making them much more accessible and neat.'\n5. Using drawer organizers that slide around in your drawers.\n'I physically cringe when I open a drawer and the organizing tray(s) slide around and cause unnecessary banging noises,' explains Hawk. 'If your drawers are suffering in this way, museum gel will be your new best friend. You can order the gel dots on Amazon, or you can order the gel or putty form by jar.'\nTo use this, just take a small dot and put them on the corners of each of your organizers to secure them to the bottom of your drawers. That way, they don't slide around and slam into the edges of your drawers every time you pull them open. 'You can easily remove the dots if you need to move things around, as they will not cause damage to your drawers,' she says.\n6. Storing similar items in multiple areas of your kitchen.\nYou want to store similar items, that logically go together, in the same area or zone of your kitchen. 'For example, you should store all the food in one area of your kitchen, and all the bakeware in another,' explains George. 'This makes it easier to locate what you need quickly and allows everyone in the home to know where to find things and where to put things back.'\n7. Organizers that don't fit properly or use the space inefficiently.\nWhen you're shopping for organizing products, it's super important to obtain proper measurements of your spaces in order to find the best fitting solutions for your items. 'Ill-fitting solutions can be just as unhelpful as no solutions at all,' explains Hawk. 'For example, if you have a cutlery organizer that is too small for your drawer and leaves large gaps on the sides of it, you're more likely to fill those gaps over time with items that don't belong.'\nYou're less likely to throw random items into spaces if there are set systems and designated spaces for specific items. 'So, if you were to instead get an organizer that expands the entire width of the drawer, you can spread out your contents neatly and take up more space for the things that belong in there (rather than inviting the opportunity for random stuffing in the future),' says Hawk.\n8. Storing kids' snacks, plates, and cups up high where they need help getting them.\nOnce your kids are age-appropriate, you can store their items in a lower cabinet or drawer where they can reach the items, as well as help put them back, suggests George. 'This is a win-win for everyone in the house!'\n9. Shopping for organizing products and organizers without properly decluttering first.\nDo not shop for products for your kitchen before you go through each section and remove, donate, or toss all items that are not necessary for you and your routines. 'Product sourcing and purchasing is done after you have established your ideal inventory,' explains Hawk. 'While shopping for organizing products and tools, it's important to remember that you're not just shopping for your space. You're shopping for systems to keep your things in your space in a way that will make it easiest for you to function within it.'\nIf you go and purchase organizing products before you've done the decluttering process, you're likely not going to be installing the most intentional systems into your spaces.\n10. Not using bins to contain items in deep cabinets.\nGeorge suggests using bins to contain items in your cabinets. 'This will prevent you from losing items in the back where you can't see them or reach them well,' she explains.\nAnother issue to watch out for is not using vertical space in your cabinets. 'Sometimes you will need to adjust shelves in order to make sure you're not wasting viable vertical space, and sometimes you won't be able to adjust shelves depending on your kitchen's structure,' explains Hawk. 'Either way, there are simple tools and methods that you can use to make sure you're optimizing the vertical space, and doing so in a way that increases functionality for you and other occupants in the kitchen.' Dinner plates can be stored sideways on vertical racks to make for easier accessibility; bowls and plates can be stored on shelf risers to break up the vertical space and aid in functionality; and mugs and wine glasses can be hung from the top of the cabinets by hooks and stem holders to allow for storage below them.\n11. Keeping things in their original packaging\nIf you're someone who thrives off of neatness and uniformity, it's in your best interest to do away with keeping things in their original packaging. 'Spices, for example, can be much easier to see and quickly grab when stored in uniform jars with uniform labels,' suggests Hawk. 'All of the colors and different packaging in your spice cabinet or drawer can be overwhelming to some people. If you're one of those people like I am, make all of the simple shifts to uniformity in order to invite more calm into your routines.'\n12. Buying too much food in bulk.\nAccording to George, buying in bulk is great, but some folks don't consider what space they have to actually store these items. 'Buy in bulk the things you use most and don't buy everything in large quantities if you don't have room to store it,' she says.\n13. Keeping food storage bins in many shapes and sizes.\n'We recommend buying storage containers in similar shapes where they can nest inside one another and save space,' explains George. 'It is also much easier to make sure you have all the appropriate lids when they're the same brand, color, etc.'\nFor more Southern Living news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\nRead the original article on Southern Living.",

    "excerpt": "Many investors found the impending retirement of FPL CEO Eric Silagy, 57, \"rushed\" and difficult to separate from recent controversies",
    "summary": "Outgoing Florida Power & Light CEO Eric Silagy signed an exit agreement that includes a multi-year \"claw back on compensation\" if there is a finding of \"any legal wrongdoing,\" according to a report written by Bank of America securities analysts, who discussed the abrupt departure of the company's longtime leader with top executives last week, revealing previously unknown details about the latest management shakeup at one of the America's largest power companies.\nThose analysts had expressed concern with the unexpected announcement and downgraded their outlook on shares of NextEra, FPL's parent company, with investors finding the impending retirement of Silagy, 57, \"rushed\" and difficult to separate from recent controversies, including allegations made in a Federal Election Commission complaint that the company violated campaign-finance laws. The bank analysts then hosted NextEra executives in Boston and New York last week to talk through Silagy's exit and other uncertainties the analysts had with the company's future, a conversation that left them \"with more comfort that there is not 'another shoe to drop,'\" according to a second report they wrote.\n\"The FEC process is currently informal and is confidential, so the risk of media updates is low,\" wrote the analysts, who nonetheless did not change their more bearish assessment of NextEra's stock.\nNextEra said its exposure around the FEC complaint was \"muted\" and that it had not had contact with the Department of Justice \"on this topic,\" according to the analysts.\nNate Monroe:Eric Silagy, FPL's chief brawler, leaves legacy of high profits but low trust\nMore from Nate Monroe:'Clawback' is welcome accountability in Jaguars owner Shad Khan's Four Seasons deal\nMore from Nate Monroe: In quest for mayor, challengers hope to derail coronation for establishment scion\nIt was during that conversation when NextEra executives disclosed to the bank analysts some of the terms of Silagy's exit, which they had not previously shared. In addition to the multi-year \"claw back on compensation for any legal wrongdoing,\" Silagy will receive his full compensation for 2022 and had to agree to a two-year non-compete clause that \"limits Silagy's ability to position himself at an adjacent utility.\" The non-compete provision was the only of the three terms the report described as \"customary.\"\n\"Management overall described the separation agreement as positive and showing that the Board of Directors had a high degree of comfort in signing off on the deal,\" the report said.\nFPL did not respond to questions sent Monday night about the Bank of America report.\n\"For shares to recover ... management will have to continue explaining the fact pattern around Silagy's retirement ...,\" the analysts wrote.\nIt's unclear if all the terms of Silagy's exit, including the claw back, are standard for FPL leaders. The company's most recent proxy statement \u2014 which was filed last year and summarizes FPL's executive compensation policies from 2021 \u2014 does not describe a \"claw back\" applying to former executives if they are found to have broken the law or committed other kinds of misconduct.\nThe statement indicated that Silagy would have gotten about $14 million if he had taken early retirement in December 2021; had he been fired that month, he would have received the company's executive severance, which would have paid him nearly $15 million. In neither case does the filing indicate Silagy would have been subject to a claw back.\nThe Bank of America report described the agreement between Silagy and the company as a \"mutual separation/retirement.\" Silagy's annual base salary was $1.4 million, with millions more available depending upon the company's performance. It's unclear how much of his 2022 compensation would be subject to the potential claw back or what his compensation from that year will ultimately be; the company will file a new proxy statement at its annual shareholder meeting this spring.\nSilagy's exit was announced a year to the day after NextEra said its former CEO, Jim Robo, was stepping down, a corporate figure who, like Silagy, found himself wrapped up in controversy swirling around one of the company's former political consulting firms, Matrix LLC.\nFPL is NextEra's largest subsidiary, one of the biggest electric companies in the United States, and a major broker of Florida political power. In more recent years, FPL was on an aggressive campaign of expansion, having absorbed the western edge of the Florida Panhandle into its service territory, which now includes more than 12 million people.\nThe bank analysts said the company had persuaded them that recent public scandal in Florida would likely not damage the company's long-term prospects.\n\"Management described the regulatory and political relationships as deep and broad-based and emphasized that there is a \u2018halo' around FPL following the success of restoration efforts following South Florida hurricanes last Summer,\" they wrote. \"We see real merit given the latest success in accelerated storm restoration after earlier Hurricane Maria demonstrated their prowess ...\"\nBut FPL has found itself in a rare defensive posture throughout the past year as news outlets throughout the state, including the Florida Times-Union, have reported stories detailing FPL's involvement with political operatives who engineered electoral trickery and engaged in other controversial behavior \u2014 like spying on a journalist (the author of this story) \u2014 as the electric utility reached the apex of its power.\nNextEra CEO John Ketchum said during the company's earnings call last week that those controversies were not connected to Silagy's decision to leave, though Ketchum then acknowledged that the events of the past year, which included that media scrutiny, had taken a toll on FPL's 11-year CEO. \"2022, obviously, was a year with a lot of challenges. The distractions Eric went through in his prepared remarks, but when you think about all the challenges that he had to overcome with the hurricanes and with high natural gas prices and inflation in the supply chain and the media allegations and all those things,\" he said.\nThose stories were largely built upon records discovered on a server belonging to a former employee of Matrix LLC, an Alabama consulting firm that had worked with FPL throughout the past decade, and eventually leaked to Florida journalists beginning in 2021. Matrix suffered a schism between its longtime owner and its longtime CEO, a fierce dispute that FPL believed was the impetus behind the records finding their way into the hands of reporters. The controversies crossed state lines, reaching into Georgia and Alabama. Atlanta-based Southern Co. and its subsidiary, Alabama Power, have also been longtime Matrix clients and, like NextEra, have seen their top executives depart in recent months.\nThe FEC complaint has also exposed the company, though it claims that exposure is limited. Still, NextEra shared a warning with investors in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing last week: \"FPL's and (NextEra's) business and reputation could be adversely affected by allegations that FPL or (NextEra) has violated laws, by any investigations or proceedings that arise from such allegations, or by ultimate determinations of legal violations,\" the company said.\nThe two former Matrix partners settled their dispute last summer, however, which has stemmed the flow of unflattering disclosures. \"The lack of any other formal investigations and further media articles after the resolution of the Matrix LLC dispute also limits likelihood of further public datapoints,\" the Bank of America analysts wrote.\nThe report says not to expect a resolution to the FEC investigation for \"more than a year,\" but NextEra executives put a positive spin on the probe.\n\"Management is quick to point out the FEC investigation is entirely confidential between parties,\" the analysts wrote, \"leading to limited external datapoints for investors or the media to track.\"\nNate Monroe is a metro columnist whose work regularly appears every Thursday and Sunday.

    "summary": "'You have to try the cake,' my grandmother said. 'Everyone comes here for the cake.'\nIt was 2002 and I was 21, sitting next to my 23-year-old sister in the backseat of our grandparents' boat of a Cadillac as my grandfather captained it down a two-lane road to Crisfield, a sleepy coastal town in Maryland.\nMy grandparents were adventurers. They had taken my sister and me on far-flung trips all over the globe when we were teenagers, including perhaps most memorably, to Alaska, where they insisted the only proper way to see the glaciers was from the inside of a single-engine turboprop airplane. That may be true, but when your eyes are closed in terror the entire ride, you tend to miss the scenery. The summer of 2002, we were supposed to be in London, drinking pints in pubs, watching grand theater productions, learning about beheadings at the Tower. But due to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11 the previous fall, our grandparents decided it was safer to stay stateside, grounded, and more specifically, just 90 miles from their home in Salisbury, MD.\nIn Crisfield, we boarded a ferry to traverse the 12 miles through the gray Chesapeake Bay waters and land on Smith Island, a 9.2 square mile strip of land, that only had about 300 residents at the time, and apparently one remarkable cake.\nIf you think I was disappointed about this change in plans, you'd be wrong. I was absolutely devastated. But I accepted this alternate, mainly because my grandparents were paying for everything and I was an unemployed college student who couldn't otherwise afford a vacation.\nAfter 45 minutes of a seasickness-inducing bumpy boat ride, a few trees appeared on the horizon. As we got closer, we saw the docks, crawling out into the bay like crooked witches' fingers, and then a few dilapidated wooden shacks, which I later learned were crab shanties where watermen sort their catch at the end of each day.\nOnce we made it to dry land, it took us about 15 minutes to tour the town. There was a general store, a post office and an elementary school (middle and high schoolers had to ferry over to the mainland daily). There were no police. There was no Target. There was no alcohol.\nIt was unbelievable to my 21-year-old self that people lived on this island\u2014so far from the mainland, dependent upon a small boat to retrieve necessities like milk or ramen noodles or celebrity magazines.\nBut we were here on a mission: The Cake. The restaurant that served it was as rundown as the crab shanties. I remember walking up a rickety wooden wheelchair ramp. I remember grease on the walls, peeling linoleum on the floor. I remember eating a halfway decent sandwich that had too many green peppers on it. And I remember The Smith Island Cake. Ten layers of thin yellow cake, separated by creamy, decadent chocolate frosting. It was delicious.\n'See?' my grandmother said, smiling. 'I told you. The cake.'\nThe cake, indeed.\nFast forward nearly two decades. I was no longer a surly 21-year-old, but a mother of four. A writer. I traveled as often as I could to Salisbury, MD to visit my grandmother, and we enjoyed many memorable restaurant meals\u2014and desserts\u2014together, but we never ventured to Smith Island or ate Smith Island cake again. Of course, if anyone asked me my favorite dessert, I would wax rhapsodic about this perfect confection, which happened to be Maryland's state dessert, and rightfully so. And then, in January 2018, I was working on a novel that I had decided to set on my own version of Smith Island. On one of my recent visits, I explained the idea to my grandmother. 'Well, let's go,' she said. She was 90 or so. Her eyesight had been fading in recent months. She used a walker (not that she needed one, she'd be quick to tell you). And she had stopped traveling years before, shortly after my grandfather had passed.\n'Really?' I said.\n'Why not?'\nSo we went. We drove the same two-lane road to the now-even-more desolate town of Crisfield. I was worried about how my grandmother would fare on the ferry ride. But I didn't need to worry. It was January. The ferry was not operating for tourists. We stood on the dock, the bitter wind in our faces, our hair. 'I was looking forward to the cake,' she said, wistfully. I had been, too.\nOn the way home, a few miles outside of Crisfield, a sign appeared like a beacon. Smith Island Cake sold here, it said.\nI grinned at my grandmother. She grinned at me. We stopped.\nIt was a shack, very similar to the shack on Smith Island. My grandmother navigated her walker up the rickety wooden wheelchair ramp, the floor was peeling linoleum. No sandwiches, but we both ordered the fried softshell crab and marveled over its perfect briny flavor\u2014not too fishy, not too greasy, the perfect crunch.\nBut we had saved the best for last: The Smith Island Cake. I let her have the honors of the first bite. She put it in her mouth. Closed her eyes. Chewed. Opened her eyes. Screwed her face.\n'It's terrible.'\n'What?'\nI scooped my own forkful.\n'Ugh, you're right.'\nIt was sweet. Sickly sweet.\n'Oh well,' my grandmother said.\nBut I was devastated. Well, not going-to-Smith-Island-instead-of-London devastated. But I was at least disappointed. How could my memory have been so far off? I had dreamt of that cake. And now.\nMaybe the person who baked this particular cake had an off day\u2014didn't follow the recipe or added too much sugar. Or maybe Smith Island Cake is similar to how I only enjoy Guinness in Ireland or how pasta tastes better in Italy. Or maybe my memory of the cake is clouded by my grandmother's excitement, by her contagious joy at the adventure we were experiencing together. The truth is, like pasta in Italy, everything was better in my grandmother's presence. But that day, even she couldn't save this slice of cake.\nMemory is a funny thing. In the last months of her life, my grandmother suffered late-stage Parkinson's. She had hallucinations, memories that weren't real. She believed outrageous things at times: that she owed great gambling debts, that my aunt had been to jail for murder, that there was a submarine just below the nursing home she lived in and the staff took her down a ladder for tours.\nOne of the last times I visited her there was in April 2019, on the tail end of a true research trip to Smith Island for my book. She couldn't join me, so my mother came along in her stead. We stayed at Susan's on Smith, a quaint bed and breakfast with an unobstructed, million-dollar view of the Bay. Not too shabby for a place that, at the time, rented out for $137 a night. From my 38-year-old perspective, it wasn't crazy that people lived out here, in the middle of nowhere. It was genius. A breath of fresh air, literally. My cell phone didn't work. There were two other tourists besides us. No bars. No traffic. It was heaven.\nAnd Susan, the eponymous owner of the bed and breakfast, served us a delightful dinner on her front porch, a few large glass windows the only thing between us and that view. She brought out dessert: A hefty slice of Smith Island Cake. I looked at it dubiously and gave the fork to my mother.\nShe took a bite. Closed her eyes.\n'Oh my,' she said. 'It's delicious.'\nAnd it was. Still not quite as good as I first remembered it, but I wonder if anything ever is as good as our memories. As soon as we got back to my grandmother, I rushed to tell her, about the trip, about the cake.\n'That's lovely,' she said, and then she turned to my sister, who was not there. 'Hello, sweet girl.'\nNow, when people ask the most fascinating, the best, the coolest place I've ever travelled, I don't tell them about Alaska and the prop plane or seeing the statue of David in Florence in person or Treasure Beach, Jamaica where I slept with barn doors flung open to hear the sounds of the crashing ocean. I tell them about Smith Island, an unassuming place off the coast of Maryland that most people have never heard of.\nAnd I think of my grandmother, who died at the age of 92 in 2020. I remember her\u2014the excitement in her eyes, her love of adventure (and dessert!) that I'm so glad to have inherited, her voice, a bit warbly in her old age, but always full of love. I smile. Or I cry. One never knows how grief will manifest itself on any given day.\n'If you go, you've got the try the cake.'\nColleen Oakley is a writer in Atlanta, Ga.

    "excerpt": "M. Night Shyamalan's twisty thriller 'Knock at the Cabin' streams on Peacock; and an expanded look at David Lynch's 'Inland Empire' from the Criterion Collection.",
    "summary": "The meant-to-be-inspirational film 'Wildflower' may be based on a true story, but it strains against its own artificiality. Kiernan Shipka gives a terrific performance as Bea Johnson, a bright and talented Las Vegas high schooler who worries that when she leaves for college, her developmentally disabled working-class parents \u2014 played by Dash Mihok and Samantha Hyde \u2014 won't be able to take care of themselves. But while director Matt Smukler and screenwriter Jana Savage deliver moments throughout the film that feel vividly real, too often they veer into the maudlin or cutesy, as though trying to soften this material for the broadest possible audience.\nThe film is structured cleverly, beginning with Bea unconscious in a hospital, narrating her story in voiceover as the various members of her family talk to a social worker. The actors playing Bea's family are powerhouses: Jean Smart and Brad Garrett as her mom's fussy parents; Jacki Weaver as her dad's free-spirited mother; and Alexandra Daddario and Reid Scott as her snooty aunt and uncle. She's also visited by her boyfriend Ethan (Charlie Plummer), a cancer survivor who like a lot of the kids in their ritzy private school has a hard time understanding what Bea's more marginalized, hand-to-mouth childhood has been like.\nThe best parts of 'Wildflower' involve Bea and Ethan's romance, which is genuinely sweet and realistically lusty, even as it's complicated by the challenges of their differing social classes and Bea's many anxieties. But the characters' raw and realistic interactions compete with scenes where Bea's family behaves like they've just stepped out of a sitcom, delivering punchlines and acting wacky. 'Wildflower' seems to be aiming to be a crowd-pleaser like the similar, Oscar-winning 'CODA.' But while that movie had its share of compromises for the sake of melodrama, its performances always felt lived-in. The characters in this film, on the other hand, too often feel like their dialogue and behavior has been cut-and-pasted from other quirky indie dramedies.\n\u2018Wildflower.' R, for some language, teen drinking and a sexual reference.\u00a01 hour, 45 minutes. Available on VOD\nAbout halfway thorough Alexandria Stapleton's documentary 'Reggie,' the baseball Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson talks about some of the great Black players who preceded him in the game \u2014 such as Hank Aaron, Bob Gibson and Frank Robinson \u2014 and notes that because they tended to wear serious expressions on their faces, the press labeled them as 'angry' or 'bitter.' Jackson, on the other hand, was often seen smirking, so the media called him 'arrogant.' According to Jackson, at no point did these reporters try to understand what he understood: that he and his colleagues just wanted to be treated with dignity, like any other human being.\n'Reggie' takes a multitiered approach to Jackson's story. About two-thirds of the movie has Jackson giving a straightforward account of his dramatic baseball journey: starting as a hot-shot Oakland A's rookie; helping to lead the team to multiple World Series; becoming one of the first faces of the free agency era; achieving superstar status while mired in the ongoing soap opera that was the late-\u201870s New York Yankees; and then fighting hard after retirement to find a place on the game's executive side. The rest of the film directly tackles the racism Jackson and his peers faced throughout their careers and features Jackson talking to other Black athletes about their common experiences.\nAll of these topics are thoughtfully explored and given a strong emotional undercurrent by Jackson's own passion. There are times, though, when Stapleton's disjointed structure is distracting. Also, by centering so much of the narrative on Jackson's voice rather than on the people who worked alongside him over the years, the film's perspective can feel limited.\nStill, Jackson is as charismatic now as when he was a ubiquitous presence on TV in the \u201870s. Back then, skeptics tried to describe him in ways that limited his accomplishments \u2014 dismissing him as selfish or a showboat. The truth was far more complicated; and one of Jackson's great triumphs is that he was great enough and persistent enough to make that truth undeniable\n\u2018Reggie.' PG-13, for strong language including racial slurs.\u00a01 hour, 44 minutes. Available on Prime Video\nDirector Stanley Kubrick had a reputation in his lifetime for being hermetic and aloof, because he declined most interviews and didn't make a lot of public appearances. But in the decades since he died in 1999, a lot of people who worked with Kubrick or knew him personally have said he was surprisingly approachable with a lively sense of humor. He worked his casts and crews hard \u2014 sometimes infamously hard \u2014 but he wasn't some mad genius in a tower.\nFor those of us who will never get to meet Kubrick, Gregory Monro's documentary 'Kubrick by Kubrick' is about as close as we'll get to spending time with him on a one-to-one level. At just over an hour long, the movie is too short to go very deep. But then Kubrick himself always resisted too much self-analysis. With access to the audio tapes from interviews Kubrick granted over the years to critic Michel Ciment, Monro constructs what amounts to an illustrated lecture, with images from Kubrick's films accompanied by his voice and supplemented by a few home movies and some vintage interviews with his actors and crew members.\nWhat emerges won't be revelatory for anyone who has spent time studying the Kubrick filmography. But it's still such a rare treat to hear the man himself say anything at all \u2014 let alone to hear him talk about why the ideas in his work and the challenges of bringing them to the screen excited him as much as they did his fans.\n\u2018Kubrick by Kubrick.' Not rated.\u00a01 hour, 2 minutes. Available on VOD\nFor all the talk about how the United States is actually disunited, one of the under-told stories about modern American life is that people of differing ethnicities, sexual preferences and political views often live relatively close to each other, in both our 'red' and 'blue' regions. In the documentary 'Refuge,' one of the main subjects is Kurdish immigrant Dr. Heval Kelli, who works as a cardiologist in Clarkston, Ga., a small town just outside Atlanta that has become a major resettlement area for refugees. The other main subject is Chris Buckley, a veteran living in a nearby Georgia community blighted by poverty, drug addiction and racism. Against all odds, these two men have gotten to know each other.\nThe 'Refuge' co-directors Erin Bernhardt and Din Blankenship divide their film between these two men's stories, although they spend a little more time with Buckley, who has gone through radical changes \u2014 from a crippling meth habit and a leadership position in the KKK to heeding his wife's demand that he straighten up. Dr. Kelli's situation is different. He's living the American dream, but is also genuinely committed to understanding why so many of his new neighbors resent him. The best thing about this film is that it doesn't reduce either man to a stereotype \u2014 or even to a pat story of redemption. Bernhardt and Blankenship do what they want the people who watch the movie to do: They observe, they listen and they stay open to accepting people, no matter who they are.\n\u2018Refuge.' Not rated.\u00a01 hour, 17 minutes. Available on VOD\nThough it's billed as science-fiction, 'Last Sentinel' feels more like a filmed version of a stage play, set mostly in a single location on a flooded Earth, where climate change has reduced civilization to two warring continents. The minimal action plays out on a military base in the middle of the ocean, where a small, bickering crew (played by Kate Bosworth, Lucien Laviscount, Thomas Kretschmann and Martin McCann) has become fed up by the lashing storms, the poor fishing and the endlessly delayed relief. These isolated, ill-informed soldiers grow increasingly paranoid after they spot a potential threat, in the form of a seemingly empty boat, on the horizon.\nScreenwriter Malachi Smyth has a good ear for dialogue, and director Tanel Toom (who has an Oscar-nominated short and an Oscar-shortlisted Estonian feature film on his resume) finds eye-catching ways to shoot this small, sparsely dressed set. But a plodding pace and the repetition of ideas stall the story's momentum. 'Last Sentinel' is more geared toward delivering a message about humanity's bent toward paranoia and self-destruction than in producing any tension or thrills. It's a very heavy film \u2014 really too heavy to move.\n\u2018Last Sentinel.' Not rated.\u00a01 hour, 57 minutes. Available on VOD\n'Knock at the Cabin' is the latest provocative and twisty suspense film from director M. Night Shyamalan, adapted from a Paul G. Tremblay novel. A sizable box-office hit earlier this year, the movie stars Dave Bautista as an apocalyptic prophet who invades the vacation home of a married couple (Jonathan Groff and Ben Aldridge) and, while holding them captive, calmly explains that someone in their family needs to die to prevent the end of the world. Available on Peacock\n'Inland Empire' is one of David Lynch's most challenging films, starring Laura Dern as an actress finding it hard to distinguish between her latest role and real life. The new Criterion edition adds over an hour of additional scenes as a special feature, alongside interviews and bonus short films that try to contextualize this elusive, dreamlike, distinctly Lynchian experience.

    "summary": "The COMMODORE 2 study met its co-primary efficacy endpoints, showing crovalimab achieved disease control in people with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not been previously treated with complement inhibitors\nThe results of the phase III COMMODORE 1 study in people with PNH switching from currently approved C5 inhibitors, supported the favourable benefit-risk profile of crovalimab, as seen in the pivotal COMMODORE 2 study\nResults from both studies will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world and presented at an upcoming medical meeting\nBasel, 7 February 2023 - Roche (SIX: RO, ROG; OTCQX: RHHBY) today announced positive results from the global phase III COMMODORE 2 study, evaluating the efficacy and safety of crovalimab in people with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not been previously treated with complement inhibitors. The study met its co-primary efficacy endpoints of transfusion avoidance and control of haemolysis (the ongoing destruction of red blood cells measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels). Results showed that crovalimab, a novel, investigational anti-C5 recycling monoclonal antibody, given as a subcutaneous injection every four weeks, achieved disease control and was non-inferior to eculizumab, a current standard of care, which is given intravenously every two weeks.\nThe efficacy and safety data from the separate phase III COMMODORE 1 study in people with PNH switching from currently approved C5 inhibitors to crovalimab, supported the favourable benefit-risk profile of crovalimab, as seen in the pivotal COMMODORE 2 study.\n'People with PNH may benefit from more options to achieve robust disease control with less frequent treatment intervals,' said Levi Garraway, M.D., Ph.D., Roche's Chief Medical Officer and Head of Global Product Development. 'As the first global phase III data for crovalimab, these results emphasise its potential to address these needs. We look forward to submitting these data to regulatory authorities, bringing us one step closer to making crovalimab available for people with PNH around the world.'\nPNH is a rare and life-threatening blood condition in which red blood cells are destroyed by the complement system. This causes symptoms such as anaemia, fatigue, blood clots and kidney disease.1 C5 inhibitors can be effective in treating the condition.2 Crovalimab has been engineered to be recycled within the circulation, enabling sustained complement inhibition through low dose, subcutaneous administration every four weeks. 3, 4\nData from both studies will be submitted to regulatory authorities around the world and presented at an upcoming medical meeting. Positive data from the phase III COMMODORE 3 study in China were presented at the American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting and Exposition on 10 December 2022. Data from the COMMODORE 3 study have been submitted via China's Centre for Drug Evaluation Breakthrough Therapy Designation pathway. This submission has been accepted under Priority Review for approval consideration by China's National Medical Products Administration.\nAbout the COMMODORE 1 and 2 studiesThe COMMODORE 2 study is a phase III, randomised, open-label study evaluating the efficacy and safety of crovalimab versus eculizumab in people with paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria (PNH) who have not been previously treated with C5 inhibitors. The study's co-primary efficacy endpoints measure transfusion avoidance and control of haemolysis (the ongoing destruction of red blood cells measured by lactate dehydrogenase levels). The adults enrolled in the study were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to be treated with either subcutaneous (SC) crovalimab every four weeks or intravenous (IV) eculizumab every two weeks. The participants who were less than 18 years old were included in a non-randomised treatment arm and were treated with SC crovalimab every four weeks.5\nThe COMMODORE 1 study is a phase III, randomised, open-label study evaluating the safety of crovalimab in people with PNH switching from currently approved C5 inhibitors. The study's outcome measures evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic properties of crovalimab. The study included people (18 years of age or older) currently treated with eculizumab. In a non-randomised arm, the study also included paediatrics (<18 years of age) currently treated with eculizumab, people currently treated with ravulizumab, people currently treated with off-label doses of eculizumab (higher than the approved dose for PNH: more than 900mg per dose and/or more frequently than every two weeks), or people with known mutations in the C5 gene who do not respond to current therapies.6\nAbout CrovalimabCrovalimab is an investigational, novel anti-C5 recycling monoclonal antibody designed to block the complement system \u2013 a vital part of the innate immune system that acts as the body's first line of defence against infection. Crovalimab has been engineered to address the medical needs of people living with complement-mediated diseases, including providing patients with a potential at-home administration option.\nCrovalimab works by binding to C5, blocking the last step of the complement cascade and is also recycled into circulation, enabling rapid and sustained complement inhibition.3, 4 Crovalimab's recycling action also enables low dose SC administration every four weeks. In addition, crovalimab binds to a different C5 binding site from current treatments, which has the potential to provide an effective treatment option for people with specific C5 gene mutations, who do not respond to current therapies.3 Crovalimab is being investigated in a clinical development programme, including five ongoing phase III studies.5, 6, 7, 8, 9 Crovalimab is being evaluated in PNH, atypical haemolytic uraemic syndrome, sickle cell disease, and other complement mediated diseases.

    "excerpt": "I took six Greyhound buses and stopped 47 times on my three-day cross-country long-haul bus trip from Miami, Florida, to Seattle, Washington.",
    "summary": "I traveled 74 hours from Miami, Florida, to Seattle, Washington, on Greyhound buses.\nI found the sights lackluster and barely slept,\u00a0but it was an affordable, rewarding way to travel.\nI would take another Greyhound bus in the future but don't plan on repeating the cross-country trip.\nI spent three full days traveling from Miami to Seattle on one of the longest Greyhound routes in the US.\nI made it 15 minutes into my 74-hour Greyhound bus ride before someone called me crazy.\nThe bus had just turned onto the highway and left the Miami skyline behind when my seatmate started coursing through customary greetings. When I told him I was headed all the way to Seattle, he was bewildered.\u00a0\"You're crazy,\" he said.\nEveryone in my life agreed. Riding one of the longest Greyhound routes in the US during my college spring break was a wild idea.\nBut I had two main reasons to take the trip: to see the American countryside through a new lens, which turned out to be smudged bus windows, and to meet people I probably wouldn't interact with otherwise.\nPlus, the ticket was relatively cheap, costing me a total of $250, and I had nowhere better to be during the first week of January. Here's what the cross-country ride was like.\nI took six different buses to reach my final destination.\nGreyhound doesn't offer a nonstop route from Miami to Seattle. Instead, my trip was broken into\u00a0six segments.\nI changed buses in Orlando, Atlanta, Nashville, Chicago, Minneapolis, Billings, and Spokane. Jefferson Lines, a Greyhound partner company, operated the route from Minneapolis to Billings. This leg was included in my ticket and luckily wasn't a hassle.\nBetween tight layovers and frequent delays, I had to move quickly to make each leg of my trip.\nMost of my layovers between connecting buses were less than an hour, which terrified me. If I lost time at the beginning of the route, it could doom my whole trip's timeline.\nThe bus to Orlando left Miami late, cutting my layover window for my next leg down from an hour to two minutes. An agent stepped on board and told us we wouldn't even have time to go into the station. Instead, we had to get our bags from the bus, walk to the loading bay, and get right on the next Greyhound.\nAs the trip continued, delays became a regular occurrence. The bus from Spokane to Seattle was the only one that left and arrived on time. I got to Nashville a full hour after my connecting bus was scheduled to leave.\nWhen we parked at the station, an agent came on the bus and told us he'd held all of our connecting buses. If the bus to Chicago left without us, there wouldn't be another with open seats for two days. The same thing happened in Minneapolis.\nGreyhound delays are so common that they seemed to be built into the system, meaning I didn't get too stressed when my buses ran behind schedule.\nI expected to pass by scenic landscapes and admire beautiful views, but we stayed on highways for pretty much the entire trip.\nAlthough the route passed through many climates and terrains, I found the sights lackluster, as the buses mostly stayed on major interstates.\nAside from the snowy mountains in Montana and the frozen fog in Wyoming, everything cool seemed to be an exit sign away.\nThe buses stopped very frequently, which added to my overall travel time.\nApart from those seven main stops, the buses made short stops roughly every two hours to pick up and drop off passengers along the route.\nIn total, the buses I took made 47 stops in three days.\n\nSeats were first come, first served on all of the buses.\nIt was wise to get in the boarding line as early as possible. People who boarded the buses in their origin cities usually got the best spots, which, in my opinion, are window seats or ones toward the front.\nVery few bus stops had vending machines or restaurants, so my food options were extremely limited.\nIt was tricky to make a reliable food plan since most of the layovers were short or even nonexistent. There were no restaurants at the bus stations, except for a sandwich store in the Indianapolis station.\nEvery bus station had vending machines, and most took credit cards.\u00a0The vending machines in the Miami station sold sandwiches, but the majority of the machines only sold snacks like chips or cookies.\nI did my best to avoid bringing smelly foods on the bus. I felt terrible eating the McDonald's that a friend gave me in Orlando, as it made my section of the bus smell until I discarded the bag at the next stop.\nIt was a good thing I brought my own snacks because I ended up relying on them.\nBefore the trip, I packed peanut-butter crackers and granola bars into a gallon-sized plastic bag, which proved to be a lifesaver.\nBy the end of the three days, I had eaten over 15 packs of peanut-butter crackers, 10 granola bars, three Clif bars, a bag of chips, a bag of Cheez-Its, six Reese's peanut-butter cups, a McDonald's Quarter Pounder, three chicken tenders, a turkey-and-cheese sandwich, and a bag of Dot's cinnamon-sugar pretzels.\n\nEach bus had a bathroom, but lavatory smells carried through the entire vehicle.\nYou can use the bathroom on board for solid and liquid purposes, but the smell did linger in the back of the bus. I was too shy to ever try it. Other passengers weren't.\nEach bus had a bathroom with a small toilet, but the whole experience inside felt unstable due to the constant movement.\nEvery station I visited had a bathroom, but many of the stalls were out of toilet paper. If the onboard bathroom isn't an option and the station bathroom doesn't work out, you can relieve yourself during the occasional 15-minute stops at gas stations.\nAlmost all of the buses were full, and I enjoyed the opportunity to meet new people.\nEvery single bus, except the one from Spokane to Seattle, was nearly full. I had a seatmate for the entire trip until that final leg, and even if I didn't have someone directly beside me, surrounding conversations often spilled around me.\nFrom Miami to Orlando, I sat with a New Yorker headed to Universal Studios. The man behind us said he'd just been released from prison so we spent most of our trip helping him to line up transportation in Orlando and communicate with family members.\nIn Washington, I shared a pack of Skittles with two kids and taught them how to use a camera.\nI felt safe in the stations and on the buses, and the drivers did a wonderful job handling passenger misbehavior.\nOne of my family and friends' major concerns about my trip was my safety, but I didn't feel worried on the buses or at the stations. I saw policemen present at every station in large cities, and the bus drivers seemed very strict with onboard misbehavior.\nIn South Dakota, a man started screaming at the bus driver after they wouldn't stop for a smoke break, but other passengers quickly defended the driver and defused the situation.\nAnd on the bus to Minneapolis, the driver removed a passenger from the vehicle after he threatened another passenger.\nI barely slept and was a grumpy mess for a large portion of the journey.\nI made the trip in one shot, never stopping at hotels or getting off the bus at night. The bus seats reclined, but leaning back felt like a social taboo similar to reclining too far on airplanes.\nI didn't bring a pillow or blanket, but I wish I had. The buses got cold at night, and my head had no natural resting point on the chair. I balled up an extra jacket and leaned against the window.\nEven when the rhythm of the bus lulled me into momentary sleep, I would wake up often. Every time the bus made a stop, the driver would turn on the lights and announce the town's name \u2014 even in the middle of the night.\nI spent the overnight bus ride from Chicago to Minneapolis in a daze, waking up every hour, at every single stop.\nI would take another Greyhound in the future but would probably avoid going cross-country again.\nI made it to Seattle in about three days and paid less than what most plane tickets cost for an experience I'll never forget. To steal a clich\u00e9: It's the journey that counts, not the destination.\nI had incredible conversations with my fellow passengers and met people I probably would've otherwise never had the opportunity to converse with on a plane, train, or road trip.\nGreyhound buses are by no means luxurious, but they made me slow down and recognize the world and landscapes around me.\nRead the original article on Insider",

    "excerpt": "Though Oklahoma and Texas may not enter the SEC until the 2025 season, their 2023 recruiting classes will be foundational to the move. How do they stack up in the 2023 team rankings?",
    "summary": "The hope was that the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Longhorns would make the move to the SEC for the 2024 college football season. But after negotiations stalled during Big 12 meetings earlier this week, the Sooners and Longhorns look like they won't make the move until 2025.\nIf they don't make the move until 2025, the 2023 recruiting class will be in their third year in Norman, providing the foundation for the Oklahoma Sooners' team that will make the transition. Guys like Jackson Arnold, Adepoju Adebawore, and Peyton Bowen will be in their collegiate prime, which should allow the Sooners to make a smooth move to their new conference home.\nIf the 2023 composite rankings from 247Sports are any indications, the Oklahoma Sooners and the Texas Longhorns will have little problem fitting in. Here's a look at how the Red River rivals stack up with the SEC in the 247Sports composite team recruiting rankings.\nVanderbilt Commodores\nNov 27, 2021; Knoxville, Tennessee, USA; Vanderbilt Commodores band plays during the second half against the Tennessee Volunteers at Neyland Stadium. Bryan Lynn-USA TODAY Sports\nNational rank: No. 52\nThe Vanderbilt recruiting class isn't as good as it was a year ago when they finished No. 32 in the 247Sports composite. Vanderbilt will need their three-star players to develop into stars if they want to be competitive in the SEC.\n\nMissouri Tigers\nJan 3, 2014; Arlington, TX, USA; Missouri Tigers wide receiver Dorial Green-Beckham (left) and wide receiver L'Damian Washington (2) celebrate the victory against the Oklahoma State Cowboys in the 2014 Cotton Bowl at AT&T Stadium. Missouri won 41-31. Kevin Jairaj-USA TODAY Sports\nMissouri did a solid job on the recruiting trail, but missing out on both Cayden Green and Adepoju Adebawore and watching them go south to Norman is akin to Oklahoma losing out on Bai Jobe to Michigan State. Hard to miss out on the top in-state prospects.\nKentucky Wildcats\nUK head football coach Mark Stoops talked about his team's prospects for the upcoming season during a Media Day event at Kroger Field in Lexington, Ky. on Aug. 3, 2022. Sam Upshaw Jr./Courier Journal / USA TODAY NETWORK\nThe addition of four blue-chip players will help the Kentucky defense take a step forward.\n\nOle Miss Rebels\nNov 24, 2022; Oxford, Mississippi, USA; Ole Miss Rebels head coach Lane Kiffin reacts while a play is revewed during the fourth quarter of the game against the Mississippi State Bulldogs at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. Matt Bush-USA TODAY Sports\nOle Miss has a light recruiting class in total signees but ended up with the No. linebacker in the cycle in Suntarine Perkins.\nMississippi State Bulldogs\nNov 24, 2022; Oxford, Mississippi, USA; Mississippi State Bulldogs players celebrate with the Egg Bowl trophy after the game against the Ole Miss Rebels at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium. Matt Bush-USA TODAY Sports\nMississippi State's class got a boost from several top junior college additions in the 2023 cycle. Safety Isaac Smith and quarterback Chris Parson are the players to watch in the cycle.\nArkansas Razorbacks\nNov 11, 2017; Baton Rouge, LA, USA; Arkansas Razorbacks helmet during a timeout against LSU Tigers in the first quarter at Tiger Stadium. Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Razorbacks took a step forward on the recruiting trail in 2023. They landed one more four-star player than they did in 2022 and signed three players in the top 15 at their position.\nAuburn Tigers\nNov 6, 2021; College Station, Texas, USA; Texas A&M Aggies fans celebrate an Aggies score against the Auburn Tigers in the fourth quarter at Kyle Field. Texas A&M Aggies won 20 to 3. Thomas Shea-USA TODAY Sports\nAuburn's been in a bit of turmoil over the last couple of years, but they're hoping the hiring of Hugh Freeze will provide some stability moving forward.\nSouth Carolina Gamecocks\nCLEMSON, SOUTH CAROLINA \u2013 NOVEMBER 26: Head coach Shane Beamer of the South Carolina Gamecocks celebrates after defeating the Clemson Tigers at Memorial Stadium on November 26, 2022 in Clemson, South Carolina. (Photo by Eakin Howard/Getty Images)\nShane Beamer has put his recruiting chops on display since taking the job at South Carolina. After picking up wins in the regular season over Tennessee and Clemson, they picked up a big signing on national signing day in Nyckoles Harbor. The Olympic hopeful brings incredible talent to Columbia.\nTexas A&M Aggies\nSep 3, 2022; College Station, Texas, USA; Texas A&M Aggies head coach Jimbo Fisher looks on during the fourth quarter against the Sam Houston State Bearkats at Kyle Field. Maria Lysaker-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Aggies picked up a huge win over the Sooners by landing David Hicks. They're building an impressive defensive front, but will the offense make enough strides to make them competitive in the SEC?\nFlorida Gators\nSep 24, 2022; Knoxville, Tennessee, USA; Florida Gators head coach Billy Napier during the first half against the Tennessee Volunteers at Neyland Stadium. Randy Sartin-USA TODAY Sports\nIt's unfortunate, but Billy Napier's 2023 recruiting class will be remembered for the loss of Jaden Rashada. Rashada's story at Florida is a cautionary tale for collectives.\nTennessee Volunteers\nNov 26, 2022; Nashville, Tennessee, USA; Vanderbilt Commodores head coach Clark Lea and Tennessee Volunteers head coach Josh Heupel meet at mid field after a shutout win by the Volunteers at FirstBank Stadium. Christopher Hanewinckel-USA TODAY Sports\nJosh Heupel created an offensive juggernaut in Knoxville and were one of the best teams in the nation in 2023. That won't slow down after the Volunteers got a signature from Nico Iamaleava.\nLSU Tigers\nNov 26, 2022; College Station, Texas, USA; LSU Tigers head coach Brian Kelly checks the replay screen during the second half against the Texas A&M Aggies at Kyle Field. Jerome Miron-USA TODAY Sports\nBrian Kelly's move from Notre Dame to LSU provided instant results as the Tigers made it to the SEC championship in year one. LSU is one of just six teams in the nation with multiple five-star signees in the class.\nOklahoma Sooners\nNORMAN, OK \u2013 NOVEMBER 19: Head coach Brent Venables of the Oklahoma Sooners celebrates as his team defeats the Oklahoma State Cowboys in the final seconds of Bedlam at Gaylord Family Oklahoma Memorial Stadium on November 19, 2022 in Norman, Oklahoma. (Photo by Brian Bahr/Getty Images)\nBouyed by three five-star players and 10 blue-chip defenders, Brent Venables created the highest-rated recruiting class in the modern era for the Oklahoma Sooners. When the Oklahoma Sooners do eventually join the SEC, this group will be the corp of that transition.\nTexas Longhorns\nDec 29, 2022; San Antonio, Texas, USA; Texas Longhorns head coach Steve Sarkisian walks off the field with director of football administration Kyrah McCowan after the 2022 Alamo Bowl against the Washington Huskies at Alamodome. Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nRecruiting has never been the problem at Texas. Putting it together to create a consistent winner has. Steve Sarkisian earned a signature from the top quarterback in the class, according to 247Sports. A lot will be riding on Arch Manning to live up to the hype.\nGeorgia Bulldogs\nDec 3, 2022; Atlanta, GA, USA; Georgia Bulldogs head coach Kirby Smart and the Georgia Bulldogs celebrate after their 50-30 victory over the LSU Tigers in the SEC Championship game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\nThe two-time defending national champion Georgia Bulldogs continue to do yeoman's work on the recruiting trail. Kirby Smart is bringing in 22 blue-chip prospects, including 13 on the defensive side of the ball.\nAlabama Crimson Tide\nSep 24, 2022; Tuscaloosa, Alabama, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide head coach Nick Saban and defensive coordinator Pete Golding during the first half at Bryant-Denny Stadium. Marvin Gentry-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Alabama Crimson Tide are a machine. Nine five-star signees is nearly double the Georgia Bulldogs. A total of 27 blue-chip players is also a ridiculous number. They have an incredible 18 players that were ranked top 10 at their position by 247Sports.\n[listicle id=79788]\n[listicle id=79824]\nContact/Follow us\u00a0@SoonersWire\u00a0on Twitter, and like our page on\u00a0Facebook to follow ongoing coverage of Oklahoma news, notes, and opinions.

    "summary": "Women have returned to the workforce in near pre-pandemic numbers, but homeownership remains elusive for those who are single\nThe homeownership rate for young single women declined in 2022 for the first time in six years, after peaking in 2021.\nThe top three metros with the highest share of listings affordable for single women are Pittsburgh, St. Louis and Detroit.\nWomen face the largest gender-based housing affordability disparities in Cincinnati, Kansas City and Oklahoma City.\nSEATTLE, March 24, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Single men have long been more likely than single women to own a home, but that gap narrowed sharply in recent years, nearly closing in 2021. However, a new Zillow\u00ae analysis shows that it widened again last year, shining light on the homebuying challenges single women face, including lower salaries and a more volatile workforce experience.\nIn 2016, 19.4% of young single women owned a home, compared with 29.6% of young single men \u2014 a gap of 10.1 percentage points. The gap shrunk throughout the next five years as more and more women entered the workforce \u2014 leading to record-high numbers in 2020 \u2014 and women's incomes began to rise. By 2021, that gap was a mere 1.8 percentage points.\nBut that progress was wiped out in 2022. The first year of the pandemic saw an outsize share of women leave their jobs to take on caregiving responsibilities, as child-care and eldercare options were in flux. Women also continue to earn significantly less than men on average, receiving approximately 82 cents to every dollar earned by men. As a result, young single women have fewer options when it comes to affordable home listings than young single men.\n\"Single women had made great strides in narrowing the homeownership gap, but the pandemic reminded us that progress is not always linear,\" said Skylar Olsen, chief economist at Zillow. \"Despite women showing remarkable resilience in returning to the workforce, single women's homeownership rate took a heavy hit in 2022. With rising and volatile mortgage rates furthering affordability challenges, the road to affordable homeownership remains an uphill battle, and it may take creative solutions or even doubling up in a home to achieve that dream.\"\nAfter growing to 28.6% by 2021, the homeownership rate for single women dropped to 24.5% last year, wiping out almost half the gains made since 2016, when single women's homeownership was at an all-time low of 19.4%. At the same time, the homeownership rate for single men increased 2.7 percentage points in 2022 to 33.1%.\nSingle women looking to buy a home in Pittsburgh, St. Louis or Detroit \u2014 which are among the nation's 50 largest metro areas \u2014 will find the highest share of affordable listings. Single women in Atlanta, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and Raleigh are most able to compete with single men in the for-sale market; single women in those metros, on average, can afford at least 2% of all active listings and at least 90% of the listings single men can afford. On the other hand, Cincinnati, Kansas City, Oklahoma City, Minneapolis, Jacksonville and New Orleans see the largest gender-based disparity in housing affordability, with single women able to afford fewer than 70% of the homes that single men can afford.\nAs the\u00a0market changes, Zillow has gathered tools for first-time buyers to make the leap into homeownership on one easy-to-navigate web page. Here are five quick tips for aspiring buyers:\nAffordability: Use Zillow mortgage calculators and affordability tools to understand what you can afford, including hidden costs of homeownership, such as property taxes, insurance and HOA fees.\nFinancing: Get pre-approved for a mortgage to gain a competitive edge, as most sellers prefer buyers who have been pre-approved rather than pre-qualified.\nHire the right agent: Hire an experienced agent who knows the local market and can help make strategic decisions, and use Agent Finder on Zillow to find the right one.\nShop smarter with tech: Use real estate technology like Zillow's multi-location search filter, Homes to Compare, virtual 3D Home tours and interactive floor plans to shop more confidently and make faster decisions.\nContingencies: Include important contingencies in offers to potentially save money in the long run, such as an inspection contingency to identify costly repairs and financing or appraisal contingencies to protect earnest money.\n\nMetropolitan\nArea\nTotal ShareListings Affordablefor Women\nMedian Salaryfor Women\nMedian ListPrice\nShare of Listings That SingleWomen Can Afford Comparedto Single Men\nPittsburgh, PA\n32.6\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$184,652\n80.20\u00a0%\nSt. Louis, MO\n31.5\u00a0%\n$22,984\n$172,838\n85.13\u00a0%\nDetroit, MI\n30.3\u00a0%\n$22,000\n$187,179\n82.05\u00a0%\nBuffalo, NY\n25.1\u00a0%\n$24,642\n$219,580\n87.32\u00a0%\nCleveland, OH\n24.4\u00a0%\n$22,000\n$185,704\n71.81\u00a0%\nMemphis, TN\n21.0\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$274,247\n89.13\u00a0%\nBaltimore, MD\n20.8\u00a0%\n$30,000\n$298,209\n91.89\u00a0%\nBirmingham, AL\n16.5\u00a0%\n$21,000\n$272,068\n89.13\u00a0%\nMilwaukee, WI\n14.3\u00a0%\n$24,000\n$262,124\n71.84\u00a0%\nPhiladelphia, PA\n13.8\u00a0%\n$28,000\n$286,526\n83.92\u00a0%\nCincinnati, OH\n12.7\u00a0%\n$21,000\n$271,930\n67.56\u00a0%\nKansas City, MO\n12.6\u00a0%\n$24,000\n$292,364\n58.40\u00a0%\nLouisville, KY\n10.8\u00a0%\n$21,156\n$277,539\n78.45\u00a0%\nIndianapolis, IN\n10.6\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$278,183\n75.76\u00a0%\nChicago, IL\n10.2\u00a0%\n$26,000\n$323,134\n70.94\u00a0%\nColumbus, OH\n9.0\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$332,039\n78.87\u00a0%\nUnited States\n8.9\u00a0%\n$22,000\n$394,625\n84.51\u00a0%\nAtlanta, GA\n7.3\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$361,553\n95.83\u00a0%\nHartford, CT\n6.9\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$346,729\n89.19\u00a0%\nCharlotte, NC\n6.0\u00a0%\n$19,600\n$362,830\n83.05\u00a0%\nOklahoma City, OK\n6.0\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$348,208\n67.25\u00a0%\nRichmond, VA\n5.8\u00a0%\n$21,000\n$339,783\n88.46\u00a0%\nMinneapolis, MN\n5.5\u00a0%\n$27,336\n$357,564\n62.10\u00a0%\nWashington, DC\n4.8\u00a0%\n$36,187\n$568,404\n100\u00a0%\nVirginia Beach, VA\n3.3\u00a0%\n$25,500\n$331,457\n78.22\u00a0%\nHouston, TX\n3.0\u00a0%\n$26,000\n$355,174\n80.21\u00a0%\nJacksonville, FL\n2.9\u00a0%\n$26,243\n$376,322\n63.35\u00a0%\nSan Antonio, TX\n2.8\u00a0%\n$23,000\n$344,112\n92.44\u00a0%\nRaleigh, NC\n2.7\u00a0%\n$30,000\n$432,565\n100\u00a0%\nPortland, OR\n2.7\u00a0%\n$25,409\n$581,543\n86.25\u00a0%\nNew Orleans, LA\n2.3\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$317,097\n56.10\u00a0%\nNew York, NY\n2.1\u00a0%\n$33,700\n$669,538\n73.48\u00a0%\nDallas, TX\n1.8\u00a0%\n$27,000\n$413,042\n86.34\u00a0%\nTampa, FL\n1.7\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$404,936\n90\u00a0%\nMiami, FL\n1.6\u00a0%\n$23,800\n$580,509\n84.26\u00a0%\nProvidence, RI\n1.5\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$532,966\n68.18\u00a0%\nRiverside, CA\n1.4\u00a0%\n$21,000\n$554,862\n80.83\u00a0%\nOrlando, FL\n1.1\u00a0%\n$24,000\n$430,506\n75.68\u00a0%\nDenver, CO\n0.8\u00a0%\n$30,000\n$652,984\n72.73\u00a0%\nNashville, TN\n0.6\u00a0%\n$36,000\n$496,901\n83.33\u00a0%\nBoston, MA\n0.6\u00a0%\n$24,800\n$861,672\n81.82\u00a0%\nPhoenix, AZ\n0.4\u00a0%\n$28,000\n$489,734\n80.30\u00a0%\nSalt Lake City, UT\n0.3\u00a0%\n$38,000\n$593,708\n100\u00a0%\nAustin, TX\n0.3\u00a0%\n$26,805\n$536,625\n62.50\u00a0%\nSan Francisco, CA\n0.3\u00a0%\n$28,044\n$991,699\n53.33\u00a0%\nLos Angeles, CA\n0.2\u00a0%\n$30,000\n$960,134\n94.44\u00a0%\nSan Diego, CA\n0.2\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$955,776\n75.00\u00a0%\nLas Vegas, NV\n0.2\u00a0%\n$29,000\n$448,550\n62.50\u00a0%\nSeattle, WA\n0.2\u00a0%\n$25,000\n$752,947\n54.55\u00a0%\nSacramento, CA\n0.1\u00a0%\n$26,000\n$639,262\n100\u00a0%\n\nSources and MethodologyLabor force participation rates for working age adults (ages 16\u201364 years) are produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and pulled from the FRED API. Annual homeownership rates of households headed by 25- to 35-year-olds (annually from 1980 to 2022) and broken out by employment, marital status and living arrangement were estimated by Zillow Economic Research using individual records from the Current Population Survey provided by IPUMS CPS, at the University of Minnesota, www.ipums.org. Information regarding gender pay equity was obtained from the Pew Research Center, www.pewresearch.org.\nThe number and share of active listings on Zillow that are affordable for single women and single men (limited here to employed singles between ages 18 and 44) were estimated using all listings ever active on Zillow during February 2023 and median individual incomes by gender, estimated by Zillow Research using individual responses to the American Community Survey, also provided by IPUMS at the University of Minnesota. A home is considered \"affordable,\" in this case, if the estimated mortgage payment on the listing takes up no more than 30% of income. We set the mortgage rate for this analysis at the average weekly mortgage rate, reported by Freddie Mac, for February.\nAbout Zillow GroupZillow Group, Inc.

(OTCQB:KITL),a publicly listed U.S.-based company, restaurant chain operator, franchisor, and product distributor with locations in the United States, Canada and Europe, is very pleased to announce that it has entered into a strategic alliance to develop a new restaurant concept with American celebrity chef, Food Network star, restaurateur and cookbook author Scott Conant.\nKisses From Italy will form a wholly-owned subsidiary to house the new brand and concept. Chef Scott Conant and his team will be taking the lead on the branding and concept development initiative in collaboration with the Kisses From Italy team. Fransmart, a worldwide industry leader in the global franchise development market and current advisor to Kisses From Italy, will play the key role of serving as the group's exclusive global franchise developer and representative.\nClaudio Ferri, co-CEO, CIO and co-founder of Kisses From Italy commented, \"first and foremost a big thank you to Dan Rowe, Fransmart's founder and CEO, for introducing us to Scott Conant and bringing all of us to the table. It is exciting when everything comes together so well, especially when major players like Fransmart and Scott present you with this kind of opportunity. There are not enough words to explain how thrilled the Company is to have Scott and his team on board with Kisses From Italy. We have worked diligently to get this agreement in place with Scott, who we believe brings considerable value and experience to the table for our Company and its shareholders. The public knows Scott from his appearances as a celebrity chef on the Food Network channel, as an experienced restaurateur/developer and book author but what he brings to the group is so much more than that. Scott clearly understands our vision and shares the same passion for this new venture.\"\nFerri added, \"during this process, I've had the opportunity to get to know Scott and, in addition to being a great person, he is not someone that would just put his name on a brand or concept unless he truly believes in it. We share similar backgrounds with our Italian heritages, and we believe that Scott understands what we are looking for and our team clearly understands Scott's vision and motivation. The team already has an exciting concept and brand in late-stage development, which we're not revealing yet, but you will hear about it soon. We have identified a major metropolitan city in the U.S. as the ideal location, where the team will be planting its flag, for the development of our new brand and concept. Overall, we believe that partnering with Fransmart and entering into this strategic alliance agreement with Scott represents the most significant achievement in our Company's history.\"\nScott Conant, two-time James Beard Award-winning chef, cookbook author, and TV personality commented, \"I couldn't be more excited about partnering with Kisses From Italy and Fransmart. To have the chance to create this fast casual brand together is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. There is something magical when a group of creatives can sit in a room and see all the through lines come together. We are developing something spectacular that not only is craveable, but is reminiscent of childhood nostalgia and the connectivity of gathering around the table. I am confident the enthusiasm for the food and business acumen of this team will set us on a path of growth and much success. As a core tenet of everything that we do, genuine hospitality and a service forward approach will be the key differentiators.\"\nDan Rowe, founder and CEO of Fransmart, stated, \"the Italian QSR and fast casual space is wide open. With Scott's ability to create amazing food and Claudio and Michael's business acumen and financial expertise, no doubt, we believe that we are going to create the category killer and most successful Italian fast casual concept.\" Dan Rowe also added, \"I believe Kisses From Italy has created a platform to launch authentic brands and products, and build the proprietary supply lines for our franchisees and continue to build on consumer packaged goods. It is not too dissimilar to what is currently being done in the market by larger players in similar segments.\" Fransmart is currently Kisses From Italy's advisor and its exclusive global franchise developer and representative.\nMichele Di Turi, President, co-CEO and co-founder of Kisses From Italy also commented, \"it goes without saying that for an emerging company like Kisses From Italy having faced the headwinds that affected the global economy, we are blessed to be in the position that we are today. In the last year or so, we looked at the Company's positioning and thought about the evolution of Kisses From Italy as a Company with different business facets. The goal has always been long-term fundamental growth and to take the steps needed to reach that growth. It has not been an easy path. If you look at the public filings, we believe we are one of the rare OTC public companies where our team has done a fantastic job of keeping costs down and dedicating as much time as needed to the Company without personally drawing on the business' cash flow.\n\"We believe that our hard work and dedication on behalf of the shareholders have now brought us the right opportunities. The idea of Kisses From Italy becoming a holding Company and housing different brands and concepts becomes a conceivable reality when working with powerhouses like Fransmart and Chef Scott Conant.\" Di Turi continued by saying, \"we believe that as a company we have built an excellent platform to launch various brands and products with focuses on building out supply lines. Consumer packaged goods continue to be part of the plan. Our Kisses From Italy branded retail products in Canada are currently available in over 70 stores in Quebec and Ontario. Our goal in working with Scott and the team is to add additional brands and concepts in different food categories, which we believe will allow the organization to leverage the supply chain and our overhead expenses across all lines, which would translate to significant future growth.\"\nAbout Chef Scott Conant\nScott Conant is a two-time James Beard Award-winning chef, cookbook author, and TV personality.

    "excerpt": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 24, 2023 / Regions BankRegions Bank, Friday, February 24, 2023, Press release pictureRegions associates Irina Pritchett, Kate Laminack and Ed Cotter have formed\u2026",
    "summary": "NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESSWIRE / February 24, 2023 / Regions Bank\nRegions associates Irina Pritchett, Kate Laminack and Ed Cotter have formed a lasting friendship with the Vyshyvanyuk family.\nBy Doug Segrest\nAs Mykola and Olena Vyshyvanyuk escort new friends to their car, the stillness of the suburban night is briefly interrupted by an almost imperceptible sound in the distance: the wail of an ambulance siren headed to a nearby hospital.\nYet on this winter evening, no one notices. That itself is a miracle.\nFor the past year, Mykola and Olena and their three children lived with the constant cacophony of war - sirens, gunfire and missile strikes back home in L'viv, Ukraine.\nBut now, thanks to a handful of Regions associates, numerous friends and local churches in Birmingham, the Vyshyvanyuks and their three children have started a new life in a quiet, safe suburb of Alabama's largest city.\n\"Back home, it's very, very cold,\" Olena said with a soft smile. \"I don't like winter anymore. The Alabama winter is much better.\"\n\"We are still adjusting,\" added Mykola. \"But not our kids. In two or three weeks, they made new friends and made this home.\"\nHow do you change lives, escape a war and find a new life in a year's time? For the Vyshyvanyuks, it started with an article in the Wall Street Journal.\nEd Cotter remembers reading about a program called Uniting for Ukraine, a program implemented by the White House, to fast-track immigration from the war-torn nation to the U.S.\n\"I signed up as a lark,\" explained Cotter, Regions' assistant general counsel. \"You set up a profile, then people ping you and you start talking from there.\n\"I connected with this family - parents and three children, ages, 6, 11 and 13 - from L'viv in Western Ukraine. We agreed we'd help them move to America.\"\nIt sounded so easy. It was anything but.\nI made donations, but it didn't seem like that was what my soul needed. But this - what Ed was doing - felt like a direct impact on someone's life and I was excited to be a part of that.\nKate Laminack, Modernization and Transformation Partner at Regions\nMaking a connection was the first step. Sponsors also had to provide two years of financial support, find housing, jobs, cars, and line up schools. With his wife, Natalie, fully on board, Ed began sharing his plans with friends and church members. It would take a team, and an active GoFundMe, to bring the Vyshyvanyuks to Birmingham.\nInspired by Experience\nIrina Pritchett was one of the first co-workers to jump headfirst into the effort.\n\"Ed suspected I'd be interested after we had a passing conversation in the early days of the war,\" Pritchett said. \"Weeks later, he reached out about the sponsorship. But what I heard was, \u2018My wife and I are thinking of doing this amazing thing but need a community to make it happen.'\"\nFor Pritchett, a Risk Initiative and Integration manager at Regions, the response was immediate. How could it be anything else?\nAs a child, Pritchett's family emigrated to the U.S. as political refugees due to growing, institutional antisemitism in the Soviet Union.\nI feel grateful to be able to pay forward the help that we received when we came to the U.S. and honor a piece of my parents' journey in doing so.\nIrina Pritchett, Risk Initiative and Integration manager at Regions\n\"My parents left behind family, friends - everything they knew - and became \u2018traitors to the (Soviet) state' without knowing where we would end up,\" Pritchett said. \"Like the Vyshyvanyuks, my parents packed our lives into one suitcase per person and took an indescribable leap of faith motivated by love for their children.\n\"I feel grateful to be able to pay forward the help that we received when we came to the U.S. and honor a piece of my parents' journey in doing so.\"\nOther associates came on board, including Franklin Danley, Payment and Credit Card Operations group manager, and Susan Anderson, Enterprise Reputational Risk administrator. Both jumped in enthusiastically.\nThen Kate Laminack of the Transformation team learned of the endeavor. Like Pritchett, it hit close to home.\nShe was 11 when she first moved to the United Kingdom, then to Birmingham, Alabama. Both of her parents were scientists who found new academic positions at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.\n\"It was ridiculously hard,\" Laminack said. \"To come at that age, in 6th grade, it was like stepping into a new world - especially as a kid. I looked different, spoke differently and my new classmates had no concept of what we were going through.\"\nYet, since the onset of the invasion, she knew she had to help.\n\"I'd been thinking about what I could do to help since the war started,\" Laminack said. \"I made donations, but it didn't seem like that was what my soul needed. But this - what Ed was doing - felt like a direct impact on someone's life and I was excited to be a part of that.\"\nAn Idyllic Life No More\nA year ago, Mykola and Olena had a thriving wedding gown business, a new home, a brick-and-mortar storefront, and a website that made their venture a success not only locally, but across international borders.\nBut as they settled in for a long Ukrainian winter, rumors of an impending war were soon replaced by the terrifying Russian invasion, and the kind of naked brutality that Europe hadn't seen since the end of World War II.\nAir raids became the norm. Idyllic neighborhoods were turned into rubble. Home became an underground shelter that provided a layer of security but did little to stop the winter's chill without electricity and gas. Food became a luxury.\nAs for the business, how do you survive when life has been turned upside down?\n\"We were in danger from the first day,\" Olena said. \"So we sent the kids off to their grandparents. And we began helping make uniforms for our soldiers - many of whom didn't have anything.\"\nMykola focused on making vests, but where do you find fabric when all the banks are closed, and you can't access your money? They used what they had, and what others scrounged, and sewed from morning through night, often by hand. They had a mission and a vision.\nBut not a future.\n\"We had to get out for our children,\" Olena said.\nThey found Ed and Natalie Cotter. And plans began formulating.\nBack in Birmingham, Cotter now had an army of volunteers of his own. They began meeting regularly at a public library, creating checklists of things they had to accomplish in addition to raising funds - find schools, jobs, housing. Using WhatsApp, Cotter, Pritchett and Laminack began regularly texting the Vyshyvanyuks, forming a friendship while keeping them informed of progress. By August, there was no turning back.\nThe U.S. was fast-tracking applications, as Uniting for Ukraine was proving to exceed the most optimistic expectations. The family was approved in August. By November, when the Birmingham crew had raised the funds to bring the Vyshyvanyuks to the U.S., the White House had approved more than 100,000 applications.\nFor Mykola, Olena and their children, the first step was to make it across the border to Poland, where they were placed in refugee housing. Immediately, Oleana noticed a difference.\n\"We spent two weeks getting processed in Poland - two weeks without air raids,\" Olena said. \"I knew then we couldn't go back home.\"\nA New Start, A New Home\nTwo months ago, they took their final flight to Atlanta, where they were shuttled to Birmingham in a van supplied by Vestavia Methodist Church. They arrived to find a furnished new home, with a refrigerator filled with their favorite foods, children's bedrooms stuffed with toys and two automobiles out front.\nIn the front room, Mykola found a sewing machine to continue his work. And a job at a local wedding boutique. The children were enrolled in school and the family began weekly English as a Second Language (ESL) classes scheduled at another church, Trinity Methodist. When Cotter and Regions associate Tommy McCain went to the local branch to open up a checking account for the family, Kismet followed.\n\"The relationship manager we talked to, Tatsiana Hall, spoke Russian,\" Pritchett recalled. \"At first, we thought that was just a crazy coincidence. But it was more than that.\"\nHall, who moved to Birmingham from her native Belarus in 2010, agreed.\n\"I said, \u2018Let me be your personal banker,'\" Hall said. \"God brought me to you.\"\nThis is home and we are safe. My hope is that family and friends can join us here.\nOlena Vyshyvanyuk\nJust before Christmas, Olena received a call that she was needed at Vestavia East Elementary immediately. Fearing the worst, she headed over only to find a room full of Christmas gifts for 13-year-old Eva, 11-year-old Ioanna and 6-year-old Viktoriia the school had gathered for their first holiday in Alabama.\nThe winters in Birmingham are mild and the suburban noises are soothing - a stark contrast to the life they left behind.\n\"This is home,\" Olena said, \"and we are safe. My hope is that family and friends can join us here.\"\nAnd, for the first time in a year, there is security. Both Mykola and Olena have jobs. They pay taxes. And their children are learning safely in school.\nWhat started with a newspaper article and a conversation led to a year of change no one could have imagined prior to war, proving anything is possible. What transpired has forever transformed the Vyshyvanyuks.\nAnd the team that came together to provide a new home.\n\"The kids are doing great. They have each other,\" Laminack said. \"They have a support network. And a really good ESL teacher.\n\"When this started, we didn't know who we were looking for, only that we just wanted to help someone. But it turned into a real relationship. We've made friends for life.\"\n\nContact Info:Spokesperson: Regions BankWebsite: https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/regions-bankEmail: info@3blmedia.com\nSOURCE: Regions Bank\nView source version on accesswire.com: https://www.accesswire.com/740710/What-My-Soul-Needed",

Not only did they all live through Nazi Germany's attempt to take over all of Europe in the early 1940s and posed for some smiling group photos along the way, that family even grew by one baby brother.\nMiracles made the difference in Manuela Bornstein, who resides in Atlanta, appearing Tuesday at Georgia College & State University and not.\nGeorgia College and Hillel, the campus' Jewish organization, presented Evening with Manuela Bornstein: A Holocaust Survivor on Tuesday, Jan. 24. Also involved in bringing the program together was the Georgia Commission on the Holocaust represented by speaker escort Mike Weinroth. GC&SU hosted the program just days before International Holocaust Remembrance Day, which was observed Jan. 27.\nHillel is an organization committed to enriching the lives of Jewish students and one that believes everyone can learn from the Holocaust. Weinroth said these stories of survival are going away, and the hows and whys of the Holocaust, where 6 million Jews were murdered in Germany alone, need to be a part of every Georgian's education.\n\"Whoever listens to a witness becomes a witness,\" said Weinroth.\nManuela's heritage is both from Germany and Holland, but most of her story was centered on her home country of France. Born in Paris, she was the daughter of a Dutch man who was raised as an observant Jew. Her mother was from Hamburg, Germany, and an only child whose father died when she was 8. Her parents met in Hamburg when her father was working there and her mother was looking for a job as a bookkeeper.\nHer father spoke French, Dutch, German and English and took other jobs in London and Paris while her mother still worked in Hamburg. After they married in Hamburg in 1930, they settled in Paris, and Manuela was born in 1933. She would have a sister named Jacquline two years later.\n\"When my sister was born, the situation in France like all of Europe was very bad,\" said Manuela. \"There was a Depression in Europe also. My father was a hard worker, so he did what had to be done.\n\"In the meantime, in Germany Hitler was coming into power.\"\nHer father traveled a lot in his food business, and Manuela believes it was in 1937 that her father went to Germany to encourage her maternal grandmother Sophie Hess to leave and live with them in Paris.\n\"She said, 'No, it's not that bad,'\" said Manuela. '\"My husband was in the first world war. It will pass. Don't worry.'\"\nBut the Hitler-led invasions in Europe were beginning, and Manuela's family, which she considered middle class, had to wonder when France was next. Four times they moved to get away from the German border. She showed a picture of an apartment building they lived in a Paris suburb that's still up today.\nShe referred to the November 1938 Night of Broken Glass.\n\"The henchmen of Hitler ransacked and burned homes ... vandalized Jewish-owned stores, all kinds of damage in cities in Germany and also in Austria,\" she said. \"The firemen stood there watching. They didn't want to stop the fire. They were there to protect the non-Jewish homes, stores. They let synagogues burn. This was a terrible, terrible thing. I cried for the Jewish community in Germany and Austria.\"\nShe referenced the Germany invasion of Poland in 1939 and how, after World War I, France and England vowed to come to Poland's help if ever invaded. War was declared by these nations on Germany, and that prompted her family to again get away from the border.\n\"The roads were packed with people traveling south getting away from the east part of France,\" she said. \"We stopped. I think my father ran out of gas maybe.\"\nThey proceeded to knock on a door and were let into a residence, where they stayed a few weeks before returning home. She recalled Gen. Charles de Gaulle addressing the French people via radio from London to help resist a German invasion.\n\"My mother heard him,\" said Manuela. \"'What can I do?' It was a very moving speech.\"\nFrance was eventually invaded. In June 1940, Paris was invaded. The French leader at the time agreed to collaborate with Germany and divide France into a free (southern) and occupied (northern) zone. For Manuela's family, it meant even more running, more hiding, and for all the people they encountered along the way, nobody would turn them in despite the potential consequences.\nTheir home, Paris, was in that occupied zone, and she said they were suffering the same injustices as other occupied countries. Her father was no longer allowed to own his business. Everyone had to have an ID card, and Germans could ask for it at any time. Manuela said if it showed you were Jewish they could humiliate you.\n\"A very dangerous situation,\" she said. \"My parents were not refugees. They were living in Paris as regular people. They both spoke French fluently.\"\nManuela said her father was never arrested, but they were restricted to their immediate neighborhood. She couldn't take swimming lessons anymore, and they could not go to theaters or museums. However, she does not ever remember being \"hungry.\"\nReferring to her grandmother Sophie, who stayed in Hamburg, Manuela said she was ordered out of her apartment and into a rundown house reserved for Jews. Sophie was able to gather with friends, but when friends didn't show up to a gathering, she knew what was happening.\n\"She wrote to my mother \u2014 this was 1941 \u2014 that when she would get the order to report to a certain place, she wouldn't do it. She would take her life,\" said Manuela. \"She did get the order, and she did take her life.\" Manuela showed what was the 'farewell' letter. \"You can imagine what my mother felt.\"\nA next point of history is July 1942 when there was a \"roundup\" of Jews by French police. Her family was spared even though they were home, again because neighbors knew they were there but did not point them out to authorities.\n\"Still, my parents were, 'We have to leave. We can't stay here. It's too dangerous,'\" said Manuela.\nBut how, when you can't go anywhere? With a lot of help, especially from those known as 'smugglers,' they get on a Metro train that is going to take them across the demarcation line from north to south France.\n\"My sister and I are very excited because we think we're going on vacation,\" she said. \"My parents never told us we were running away.\n\"But the train didn't move. My father very nervously as you can imagine gets off the train to see what was causing the delay. He came back to report there had been a roundup of Jews on the train on the other side of the platform. If there had been a roundup of Jews in our train, I wouldn't be here. Another miracle.\"\nWhen changing trains, Manuela said she fell and hit her head on a platform. It was not serious enough to require going to a hospital. Otherwise ...\nThe family made it safely to the other side, encountering no German patrols. They did have to deal with French authorities, and at one regional capital the chief of police she said could have turned them in instead told them to \"disappear, hide somewhere.\" But they did not know this part of France. Where do they go? They found a house for rent in a village called Le Got and got the chief's approval.\nAfter settling there, still in 1942, Manuela's mother became pregnant. Also at this time were Allied invasions in Northern Africa. So the Germans decided there would be no more free zone in France.\n\"This was a bad time for my mother to be pregnant,\" she said.\nBut one more miracle occurred. They were living upstairs in the house at Le Got, and the owner \u2014 suspected of helping resistance efforts \u2014 never revealed there was Jewish family living upstairs even though he was arrested. When she and her sister were at school, that house had been surrounded by German patrol cars. They relied on short-wave radio for news of the resistance from the BBC, and she said if the Germans had heard this radio they would have found her parents. They would have returned from school to find them gone.\nA litany of miracles, she said.\nManuela's mother went through a difficult pregnancy, but her new brother Franklin was born in August 1943. Franklin was named after the U.S. President at the time, who was seen as the only hope of survival.\nThe real hope came June 6, 1944. D-Day. Manuela said when her father heard the news, he was picking cherries in a tree, and he fell out of the tree he was so excited. On Aug. 25, Paris was liberated.\n\"The biggest miracle is that four of us go into hiding, five coming home,\" said Manuela. \"Every Sunday my parents would raise their glass of wine and toast each other 'until next Sunday' hoping to be alive another week. They were so terrified.\" (\"Until Next Sunday\" is the title of Manuela's sister's book.)\nBut so many other family members died in concentration camps. Her father's business did pick up again. She reiterated she was able to speak about it now through miracles and help from the French people.\n\"It was dangerous for them to protect us,\" she said about total strangers. \"But they protected us. You can help people, especially if you see somebody in danger. It's your duty to help.\"",

Subscribe for free.\nWelcome back to The Station, your central hub for all past, present and future means of moving people and packages from Point A to Point B.\nEV charging has improved over the years, but it's still unable to support the number of electric vehicles the Biden Administration wants to see on the road in the next few years. The administration's $7.5 billion EV charging initiative is supposed to help solve that problem. And now, we finally have clarity around what it will take for companies to access those funds.\nThe Biden administration laid out the final standards\u00a0for its plan to build a national network of 500,000 electric vehicle chargers along highways, including a requirement that all EV chargers funded through the\u00a0Inflation Reduction Act\u00a0must be built in the United States. Specifically, the final assembly and all manufacturing processes for any iron or steel charger enclosures or housing must occur in the United States. And by July 2024, at least 55% of the cost of all components will need to be manufactured domestically, as well.\nAll chargers are also required to use a standardized payment system that is smartphone-friendly and all connectors must use the 'combined charging system' (CCS), which dominates in the U.S.\nWill this be enough to solve the U.S. EV infrastructure problem? Or does the plan miss some critical points? Let me know what you think and I'll share it in the next newsletter.\nOK, let's dive into the rest of the news of the week.\nYou can drop us\u00a0a\u00a0note at\u00a0tips@techcrunch.com.\u00a0If you prefer to remain anonymous,\u00a0click here to contact us, which includes SecureDrop (instructions here) and various encrypted messaging apps.\nBrexit has cost Ride & Glide, a micromobility retailer in the UK, $200,000 per year.\nCowboy says it will be profitable by this summer.

And while we're proud of these operational results, we remain mindful of the global economic unease. As a result, we're being judicious with capital allocation and incremental risk.

    "summary": "ATLANTA \u2014 Without Black voters, there would have been no President Jimmy Carter.\nIn 1976, African Americans catapulted the underdog Democrat to the White House with 83% support. Four years later, they stuck by him, delivering nearly identical numbers even as many white voters abandoned him in favor of his victorious Republican challenger, Ronald Reagan.\nThis enduring Black support for Carter illuminates two intertwined and epochal American stories, each of them powered by themes of pragmatism and redemption. One is the story of a white Georgia politician who began his quest for power in the Jim Crow South \u2014 a man who, as late as 1970, declared his respect for the arch-segregationist George Wallace in an effort to attract white votes, but whose personal convictions and political ambitions later pushed him to try to change the racist environment in which he had been raised.\n\nThe other is the story of a historically oppressed people flexing their growing electoral muscle after the landmark Voting Rights Act of 1965 removed obstacles to the ballot box. Certainly, for some Black voters, candidate Carter was simply the least bad option. But for others, the elections of 1976 and 1980 were an opportunity to take the measure of this changing white man, recognizing the opportunity he presented, and even his better angels.\n'His example in Georgia as a representative of the New South, as one of the new governors from the South, was exciting, and it was appealing,' said Rep. Sanford Bishop, D-Ga., whose congressional district includes Carter's home. 'It carried the day in terms of people wanting a fresh moral face for the presidency.'\nCarter's support for Black Americans sheds light on the political evolution of the man, who at 98, is America's longest living president. (Carter entered hospice care earlier this month.)\nThe foundation of his relationships with Black voters and leaders was built in his home base of Plains, in rural Sumter County, Georgia. Its Black residents can recall his efforts to maintain and then later resist the racist policies and practices that targeted the majority Black community.\nJonathan Alter, in his 2020 biography 'His Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life,' noted that Carter, as a school board member, had made a number of moves to accommodate or uphold the local segregationist system of the 1950s, at one point trying to shift resources from Black schools to white schools in the name of sound fiscal management.\nBut Bobby Fuse, 71, a longtime civil rights activist who grew up in Americus, Georgia, a few miles from Plains, recalled that Carter had also shown moments of real character. Among other things, he noted Carter's objection to his Baptist church's refusal to allow Black people to worship there.\n'I wouldn't have voted for anybody running against Jimmy Carter, more than likely,' said Fuse, who said he had first voted for Carter in his successful 1970 governor's race. 'Because I knew him to be an upright man different from the other Southerners.'\nThere were seeds of this difference early in the life of Carter. But as a young politician, it did not always translate into action. And the repressive environment of the mid-20th century meant that he had no Black voters to woo when he started his first foray into electoral politics with a 1962 bid for a south Georgia state Senate seat. Due to racist restrictions, hardly any Black people were registered to vote in his district at the time.\nHistorians say that Carter, early in his career, was both a creature and a critic of the strict segregationist system he had been born into. He largely kept his head down as civil rights advocates fought and sacrificed to change the status quo, with serious, and sometimes dangerous, protests and crackdowns flaring up in Sumter County.\nLater, once he had achieved positions of power, he was outspoken about renouncing racial discrimination, seeking means to redress it and trying to live up to those principles. During his presidency, he famously enrolled his daughter, Amy, in a public school in Washington, D.C. Decades after leaving the White House, he offered a full-throated rebuke of Barack Obama's Republican critics, calling their attacks racism loosely disguised as partisanship during his presidency.\n'He saw his role as an elder statesman,' said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. 'The fact that you have an elderly white president, from the South, who is there saying, \u2018Look, the emperor has no clothes; that argument has no weight; that dog won't hunt,' is something that he didn't necessarily have to do.'\nCarter had grown up with Black playmates in the tiny community of Archery, Georgia. As a boy, his moral and spiritual north star had been a Black woman, Rachel Clark, the wife of a worker on the Carter property. He slept many nights on the floor of her home when his parents were out of town. Alter, the biographer, wrote that she had taught him about nature and had impressed him with her selflessness. Alter wrote that Carter had even been teased in his all-white elementary school for 'sounding Black.'\nBy the mid-1950s, Carter returned from a stint as a naval officer and settled in Plains, where he built on the family's successful peanut business. The Brown v. Board of Education decision, which dismantled the old separate-but-equal regime for American schools, had inflamed white Southerners. Despite his efforts to appease white parents while on the school board, he was also, Alter notes, 'the only prominent white man in Plains' who declined to join the local chapter of the racist White Citizens' Council.\nAfter winning his 1962 state Senate race, Carter, a man of searing ambition, set his sights on the governor's mansion but was defeated in 1966. He ran again and won in 1970, with a campaign full of unsubtle dog whistles to aggrieved white voters that included promises to restore 'law and order' to their communities and, according to Alter, the dissemination of a 'fact sheet' that reminded white voters that Carter's Democratic opponent, former Gov. Carl Sanders, had attended Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral.\nIn the Democratic primary, Black voters took notice: Sanders, in the runoff, garnered roughly 90% of their votes. But by the general election, Carter was campaigning heavily in Black churches.\nThe dog-whistle strategy had generated its share of bitterness and criticism. But a course correction followed, in the form of Carter's inaugural address.\n'The time for racial discrimination is over,' he said.\n'It was really dramatic for all of us, because he said it in that forum, as he was being sworn in,' Fuse recalled. 'And hopefully we were going to see some activity from that.'\nThey did. Carter expanded the presence of Black Georgians in state government, from senior officials to state troopers, and welcomed civil rights leaders to the governor's office.\nBlack skeptics were converted into allies in other ways. In an interview this week, Andrew Young, the civil rights leader who would serve as ambassador to the United Nations under Carter, recalled having 'a real prejudice to overcome' when the two men first met as Carter was running for governor.\nWhen the matter of Fred Chappell, Sumter County's notoriously racist sheriff, came up, Carter called him a 'good friend.' Young was taken aback: Chappell had once arrested King after a protest. When King's associates tried to bring him blankets to ward off the cold, Chappell refused them and turned on the fan instead.\nLater, however, Young said he had gotten to know Carter's family, including his mother, Lillian. Young, too, came to trust him. 'I decided that he was always all right on race,' Young said. 'He never discriminated between his Black friends and white friends.'\nIt went the same way with other influential civil rights leaders in Georgia, including King's widow, Coretta Scott King, and his father, Martin Luther King Sr. According to author and journalist Kandy Stroud, the elder King sent a telegram to voters lauding Carter's appointment of Black judges and his support for a fair housing law, among other things. 'I know a man I can trust, Blacks can trust, and that man is Jimmy Carter,' he wrote.\nBy the time Carter started his 1976 bid for the White House, it was these leaders who spread the message beyond Georgia voters that Carter was worthy of their trust. They helped bolster the 'peanut brigade,' the nickname for the team of staff members and volunteers spread across the country to campaign for him, making it a mix of Black and white Carter supporters.\n'They had to tell these people in the rest of the country, \u2018Yeah, he's governor of Georgia, but he's a different kind of governor of Georgia,'' Fuse said.\nIn a recent interview, the Rev. Al Sharpton recalled that the King family had lobbied him to support Carter in 1976. That went a long way, he said, but so did Carter's presentation. 'A Southern guy that would stand up and talk about racism?' he said. 'This was the kind of guy that my uncle trusted down South. And he connected with us for that.'\nAs a presidential candidate, however, Carter again showed his propensity for trying to have it both ways in a racially divided country.\nGeorge Skelton, a Los Angeles Times columnist, recently recalled covering the candidate as he campaigned in Wisconsin and watching as he seemed to give contradictory messages on school busing to separate groups of Black and white voters within the span of a single day.\nAnd in a speech about protecting neighborhoods, Carter used the phrase 'ethnic purity,' creating a mini-scandal. Soon after, Young told him that the use of the phrase had been a 'disaster for the campaign.' Carter issued an apology.\nBut Carter also found common cultural ground with Black voters nationwide, many of whom shared his Christian faith. They saw how comfortable he was in Black churches. '\u2018Born again' is the secret of his success with Blacks,' Ethel Allen, a Black surgeon from Philadelphia, told Stroud at the time.\nAs president, Carter sought 'to mend the racial divide,' said Kai Bird, another Carter biographer. Bird noted that food aid was significantly expanded under Carter, benefiting many poor Black residents in rural areas. Bird also noted that the Carter administration had toughened rules aimed at preventing racially discriminatory schools from claiming tax-exempt status.\nIf that explains why Black voters stuck with Carter in 1980, it may have also sown the seeds of his defeat. 'I think all of these decisions were too much for white America,' Bird said. 'Ronald Reagan came along and appealed much more to white voters.'\nFuse agrees. All these years later, he still laments the fact that Carter was denied a second term. Instead of focusing on the problems that plagued Carter's time in office \u2014 the inflation, the energy crisis, the American hostages stuck in Tehran \u2014 Fuse spoke, instead, about that hope that Carter had engendered in 1976, and not just for Black voters.\n'When this white man comes along who's grinning with a broad smile after Watergate, he lifted our spirits,' Fuse said. 'He lifted everybody's spirits.'\n\u00a9 2023 The New York Times Company",

    "summary": "In a school just east of Atlanta, students routinely miss 30 minutes of their 47 minute first period classes because of bus driver shortages.\nMath workbooks at a Eugene, Oregon school arrived months into the semester, delayed by paper shortages.\nSome 15 classes at one suburban New York high school were canceled last semester for lack of substitutes.\nIn a Maryland high school outside D.C., new pencils were nowhere to be found when classes started in the fall, the victim of supply chain lags and no staff to order them.\nNacho cheese, reliably cheap and available, has become a mainstay on one Indianapolis school's lunch menu as spiraling costs and ingredient shortages have led to meals on repeat.\nThis is the new normal in schools across the country: Classes are back in person but day-to-day operations are a far cry from pre-pandemic norms, the lingering effects of the COVID crisis challenging everything from staffing and student mental health to school lunches.\nCompiling dozens of examples from survey responses and original reporting, The 74 found schools are trying to function and adapt.\nFor administrators like Greg Zenion, principal at Chariho Middle School in Rhode Island, this year marks the first time he cannot fill core jobs: teacher assistants, special education teachers and social workers.\n'I'm in a pretty rural, beautiful area. I'm surrounded by soft fields. My building was built in 1989. It's a great place to work. It's a beautiful building,' Zenion said. 'I can't get people to apply for the jobs. So I think a new normal is how do you run a building short-staffed and how do you get creative to fill your positions?'\nYet educators say necessity can indeed be the mother of invention.\n'Despite all of this adversity being talked about, our school people still got their chin straps buckled up. They're still ready to go to work, and they're still over there doing everything they can do for kids,' said Ronn Nozoe, CEO of the National Association of Secondary School Principals. 'This year is different because folks have found all kinds of creative ways to provide.'\nRelated: One Florida Principal's Solution to Teacher Shortages? Recruiting His Students\nSome examples:\nTo ease the burden of juggling a family with teaching full-time, an Indianapolis school opened free child care for staff on-site. At one Milwaukee school, $20 gift cards are given to teachers who substitute.\nSchools, public and private are all hands on deck \u2014 recruiting drivers and other staff at grocery stores, offering bonus pay.\nBut no amount of personal dedication can alleviate systemic strains. Even armored with the optimism inherent to many school leaders, they are coming to terms with a new reality and what's at stake.\n'Our members remain dedicated to kids and excited about [school],' Nozoe said, 'but they are, especially the ones who have been around a bit and can see the writing on the wall,\u00a0worried about the shortages and what that may mean if we can't augment the workforce quickly enough\u2026'\nAs one teacher at a school in Delaware serving a high proportion of students in poverty explained, 'the students are so burnt out and so are we.'\nTo make up for learning loss, teachers at the Delaware school introduce new material on days when students also take mandatory tests. Their veteran teachers are retiring more often, leaving big gaps. One teacher now has regular panic attacks. 'If it wasn't for my incredible coworkers and admin I wouldn't be able to do it,' the educator wrote.\nSeveral educators painted a picture of students changed by core social years spent in isolation in front of screens: less curiosity or interest; individual work preferred to working with peers; missed class and deadlines. Students arrive, and leave, exhausted, but are expected to catch up more than ever before.\nThe need was far more significant than any of us realized\u2026to employ social workers, mental health professionals. Pre-pandemic, those were nice if you could get them but now\u2026 those are necessary.\nPrincipal Monica Asher, Columbus, OH\nThe concerning behavior has made school staff put students' emotional well being first, with more of an emphasis on offering school-based mental health services.\n'The need was\u2026far more significant than any of us realized,' said Monica Asher, a Columbus, Ohio high school principal.\u00a0'Definitely a new normal is\u2026 more of an acceptance\u2026to employ social workers, mental health professionals. Pre-pandemic, those were nice if you could get them but\u2026now \u2026those are necessary.'\nRelated: Shortages Forced a Principal to Teach 6th-Grade English. She's Alarmed By How the Pandemic Is Affecting Her Students\nPieced together, the anecdotes offer a clearer image of the American school day as the pandemic continues to have a hold on students, families and educators:\nBy 5 a.m., a high schooler in a small city between Orlando and Tampa, Florida is up \u2014 sleep deprived but with a sense of urgency: He has to reach the Wesley Chapel bus hub by 5:59 a.m, to get to class by 7:06 a.m. His school now starts earlier to make up for hurricane days and remote learning.\n'Our bus situation is pretty much a dumpster fire,' his mother responded in the survey, '\u2026this is unhealthy for those kids. And half the time the bus isn't at the hub on time, meaning we parents have to drive the half hour one-way trip to the school\u2026 '\nAt a community school in northern Georgia, 'some teachers at my school delay instruction in order to wait for the late buses. This means that some of the students who are not late to school are sitting idly. It is a huge waste of instructional time,' said a school director.\nIn Omaha, Nebraska, the city's major urban district serving over 50,000 students has begun cutting routes, increasing the living radius to qualify.\nThe underlying culprit, many believe, is simple economics.\n'I hear from principals all over the country that it's really hard because of the school bus driver pay,' Nozoe said. 'These folks who drive commercially can get more money [in] other venues than driving a school bus. (And) it takes a certain kind of person to drive a school bus. You just can't turn around and scream at the kids at the top of your lungs.'\nAt a Milwaukee Catholic high school, social studies teacher Mary Talsky has noticed lots of empty seats. For every email about a kid out sick, she gets three to four times more about absences because of mental health issues: My kid is struggling with anxiety and can't come in today; I'm taking my child to an appointment with a psychiatrist.\n'I have not seen numbers like this before,' Talsky said. 'Maybe they're just more willing to say that out loud than they were in the past.'\nAcross the country, teachers start the day by opening up adjoining classroom walls \u2014 asked to cover for colleagues.\nBrooklyn high school senior Samantha Farrow told The 74 students don't come to school with COVID as often as they did this time last year. There's more understanding from teachers if you miss school for being sick, more flexibility around work turned in late.\nOur food services are still\u2026reeling\u2026 which can result in kids having to repeat meal patterns day in and day out\nJordan Habayeb, Managing Director of Operations at Adelante Schools, Indianapolis, IN\nAnd she's noticed another change.\n'I think a lot of people don't really sit in the cafeteria anymore, because it feels like a superspreader event,' she said. 'So a lot of people eat in the hallways or go outside to eat.'\nFurther west, at Adelante, a K-8 school in Indianapolis, students in the lunch line see now familiar sights: yellow and plastic. Nachos and frozen items make the cut often: as is the case in many districts, food distributors have increased the dollar price per meal. Others districts have trouble finding ingredients.\n'Our food services are still\u2026reeling from the overall cost (and) day to day shortages of what can be offered fresh and what can't \u2014 which can result in kids having to repeat meal patterns day in and day out\u2026' said Jordan Habayeb, managing director at Adelante.\n'We have to dip into [federal] funding,' to offset the increases in food costs, 'which then means we have to kind of take the gas off of something else,' Habayeb said. On the chopping block is funding to expand after school clubs. Fifteen are offered, half as many as schools nearby.\nCome day's end in Snellville, Georgia, some students pass on tutoring or afterschool clubs: There is no late bus.\nIn New Orleans, the principal of a Spanish immersion school reviews applications for new English teachers, the need for more instructors after students spent nearly a year learning remotely and only hearing Spanish spoken at home.\nA high school administrator in Antioch, Illinois starts making calls: Their school furniture supplier has had trouble filling orders.\nAt the Indianapolis school with plenty of nachos and cheese, about 40 students and staff's own kids file into a new free after care program that offers in-depth math tutoring. Fifteen families are on the waitlist.\nAnd in southern Florida, Haines City High School families head to dinner, part of a new 'Parent University' hosted monthly on-campus. They talk about the new normal around technology, learn how to check their childrens' grades and progress toward graduation requirements.\n'I think it is really important to remember that yeah, [the pandemic] was pretty bad,' said New Orleans middle school principal Laura Adelman-Cannon, who had to rebuild post-Katrina. 'But there have been other really bad things. And we made it through, right? It's possible.'",

    "excerpt": "Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass have walked the Knoxville College campus. That motivates its leaders to uphold the HBCU's legacy.",
    "summary": "The doors of Knoxville College have been open for nearly 150 years. Leaders of the historically Black college want to make sure prospective students and the Knoxville community know those doors are still open now, even while it rebuilds.\n'I'm just hoping that we can be that light again where we do advocate for our community, but provide a culture and provide a place, a sense of belonging and a sense of home,' Knoxville College Vice President Dasha Lundy told Knox News.\nLundy is part of the team helping to\u00a0revitalize the institution founded in 1875. She's often reminded of the students, faculty members and even the great leaders such as Martin Luther King Jr. and Frederick Douglass who walked the campus before her. They motivate her to uphold the school's legacy after it has faced challenging times for nearly 30 years.\nIn collaboration with the University of Tennessee, Morris Brown College in Atlanta and other schools,\u00a0regaining its accreditation by 2024 after losing it in the late 1990s is Knoxville College's main priority now.\nThirty-two dedicated students are currently enrolled, and the school only offers online courses for now. A modular leadership building under construction hopefully will bring students back to campus by the fall.\nThroughout its\u00a0storied history, Knoxville College has uplifted Knoxville's Black residents, produced some of Knoxville's greatest Black talent and played a crucial role during the civil rights movement. That is what Lundy wants for people to remember and for the school to return to.\n'This is the school where you find your liberation,' she said. 'We will teach you how to combat (an oppressive) system, of course, not with hate but with a spirit of love and empowerment.'\nIn an interview with Knox News, Lundy offered an in-depth update on Knoxville College's accreditation progress and the future of the HBCU.\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\nDasha Lundy: I think you always got to look back. Sometimes we forget how far we have come. Knoxville College was founded 10 years after the Emancipation Proclamation. There's a picture in my office from 1914. It's all these students and the faculty and I just think about the greats that have been here, the greats who walked the land, George Washington Carver, (Martin Luther) King, Frederick Douglass. So many greats walked this land and I think what keeps me going is that call. It's the call to educate. It's the call to empower. It's the call to elevate. It's the call that we know how to help each other. We understand the oppressive system. And we know that we have to create leaders who are ready to go out into not only the local city and the communities but go out across the world to share what those gifts that God has given you. I think it's just cause of the oppression that we continue to experience in 2023 and people thought all this was over.\nIt's that driving force that is letting us know we have 52 acres of land and how do we use this land to serve? I'm just sharing my heart with you now, but I have people calling me because they've been evicted and they don't understand why and I'm like, God, can we use this land to build housing and welcome our people in here so we can heal them? We can educate \u2013 \u00a0I'm gonna keep using the words educate, empower, elevate, because to me, that's the path to liberation. I feel like this is the school where you find your liberation, where you don't have to be broken mentally and spiritually and physically through a system that's not designed for you. We will teach you how to combat that system, of course, not with hate but with a spirit of love and empowerment.\nReaching out to the community is intentional. We have a small staff, but we all are rooted in a love of restoring the HBCU (Historically Black Colleges and Universities). It's just more of telling your neighbor, telling people and being out there. I spoke at a church and I'm going to speak at another church (soon). I'm also county commissioner for District 1 and my colleagues know that I work for Knoxville College. Every room that I'm in, I tell the Knoxville College story. And everyone who's here that works with us, they're always telling the Knoxville College story.\nWhen we were at our peak, I mean when you think about 3,000 students and then the faculty, and how we provided culture here, and a space of safety here, where you can come and be yourself and unapologetically yourself. This year, I want to engage community more and maybe having a Juneteenth event or some kind of events, just to say you can come here and you will be welcome here, no matter what.\nWe play a big role; I'm not sure if the government understands that role that we played in the past of providing that advocacy work when it comes to Black issues. We fill the void. Knoxville College students were the ones that organized the sit-ins during the civil rights movement. We have to have that back because we are under attack right now when people don't want us to know our history or people don't value our voice here.\nYes, (but) it costs a lot of money to do that. So, if anybody wants to donate, they can go to our website. Of course, we want to maintain the historic buildings, and having those conversations with historic preservation people around here and see if there's any grants. The city of Knoxville did give us a $200,000 grant last June and we put that money into stabilizing the library here. But there's no construction or anything with the historic buildings because they are in a state of disrepair, and it takes tons of money to do that. But we're not giving up on that because we know that we've been here for 148 years.\n\nWe still have to tell our story because we still live in a space that people don't think we need a HBCU and we're saying we do. With what's going on in the world and across the nation, people don't want us to learn our history more, as we celebrate Black History Month. We have to do a better job at telling our story, with HBCUs and the Knoxville College story, and how we have a purpose here to help transform our community.\nAccreditation, first and foremost! But really just bringing awareness that we're here. I've been speaking a lot more, having opportunities to speak and I realize a lot of students don't know that we're open. The community doesn't know that we're open. We offer an associate degree in general studies and the tuition is waived. It's all virtual. And your credits will transfer within the state of Tennessee. Most of our students are working adults and it works for them.\nThere may be some students out there, especially in our community that may not want to go to school or feel like they can't afford it. Sometimes I get students that say, 'I'm not even sure if college is for me,' and we try to encourage them to go ahead and apply. Since we are a small school and we are an HBCU, and HBCUs have always been rooted in helping people, we give a little bit more intention on making sure that we create a family atmosphere and an atmosphere of winning here. They know they can count on us. There are not too many schools that you can call on the vice president or anybody in the administration staff to talk through your issues, but we really make ourselves available and we can do that now. I hope we can continue to do that as we grow and create a culture to really educate, empower and elevate a community.\nWe got to this point of accreditation because we owned 50% of the Pilot gas station that was on Western Avenue. That sale put money in our bank to pursue accreditation because you really can't pursue it unless you're financially stable. We then hired Dr. Kevin James, the president of Morris Brown College, because he was going through the same thing (of regaining accreditation). It was inspiring because people kept saying, it's never been done that you can gain accreditation after it's been gone for several years. He agreed to help us, give us some pointers. He asked what schools around Knoxville can help. We asked the University of Tennessee if they can help, send some of their students that are working on their Ph.D. in higher education, would they mind being our team. They said yes and it's been quite a journey.\nWe had our accreditation launch in June and the team \u2013 I call them the A-Team \u2013 they have been working on our documents and getting them cleaned up, making sure that they're compliant. We're going through accreditation with Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools. We're still finalizing the documents. It's been a long road because accreditation is really about integrity. Are you doing what you say you're going to do? Do you have what you need? Do you have the money in the bank to do that? Are you compliant with paying your bills? So, hopefully we will be finishing up with the documents and turning in our self-study in to the accreditation agency and figuring out our next steps.\nAs far as the partnership with Dr. Kevin James and UT, it's been a blessing. We feel like we have all become family through the process because it's a stressful process and it's been some hard times. We also have a partnership with Meharry (Medical College in Nashville) to help build and inspire a workforce to go into the medical field. That's what was their answer to the declining workforce after COVID-19. Since we have few students, we actually reached out to the SMART Institute, a local nonprofit that works with the inner-city schools. We have a partnership with them to help expose at least 100 high school students to the medical field.\nIt's been great. I think we have about 32 students enrolled. These students have been with us, and they keep showing up. I know people probably question, 'Where do they get their students from?' They're all over the nation. Some have been recruited through alumni because alumni love their school and they want other people to experience it, but we are definitely grateful for our students and grateful for the semesters. Semester's kicked off fine, and we're prepping for graduation.\nYes, we are seeing an increase in enrollment and an increase in people applying. A lot of high school students have been applying more. It feels good because when we opened back up, it was probably just that one (student), and then you wonder, 'Is this real, can this happen?' But people are applying. We even have people across the waters from a country in Africa applying. So, somehow our name is being spread. And we are rooted in faith here. We just believe that things happen organically because we are doing our part.\nWe're still sticking with our associate degree of general studies. But with the accreditation, we're hoping to add a bachelor's degree program. I have to go through the state level first. So, we're currently working on that application, to get a bachelor of science in business degree. We will probably have some changes because a lot of our students are interested in business.\nAs we build capacity, hopefully we can do more, (we) just got to go through that process, but we see the end and we know the end will be great. You just got to go to the process, the troubled times to the other side. We want people to know we're open. We have (McMillian Chapel on campus) open, not (for) church services, but as a community space. If people want to come, if people want to inquire, our doors are open.\nDevarrick Turner\u00a0is a trending news reporter for Knox News.

For further information regarding these non-GAAP measures, including the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures, please refer to the financial tables below, as well as the \"Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\" section of this press release.\nBasis of Presentation\nAs a result of the business combination (the \"Business Combination\") effected by GS Acquisition Holdings Corp II (\"GSAH\"), the company's financial statement presentation distinguishes Mirion Technologies (TopCo), Ltd (\"Mirion TopCo\") as the \"Predecessor\" until the closing date of the Business Combination, October 20, 2021 (the \"Closing Date\"). Mirion, which includes the combination of Mirion TopCo and GSAH subsequent to the Business Combination, is the \"Successor\" for periods starting from the Closing Date. As a result of the application of the acquisition method of accounting in the Successor period, the financial statements for the Successor period are presented on a full step-up basis as a result of the Business Combination, and are therefore not comparable to the financial statements of the Predecessor period that are not presented on the same full step-up basis due to the Business Combination. Mirion adopted a calendar year fiscal year in connection with the closing of the Business Combination.\nChannels for Disclosure of Information\nMirion intends to announce material information to the public through the Mirion Investor Relations website ir.mirion.com, SEC filings, press releases, public conference calls and public webcasts.

We use the following non-GAAP financial information to evaluate our ongoing operations and for internal planning and forecasting purposes. We believe that non-GAAP financial information, when taken collectively, may be helpful to investors because it provides consistency and comparability with past financial performance. However, non-GAAP financial information is presented for supplemental informational purposes only, has limitations as an analytical tool, and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for financial information presented in accordance with GAAP. Other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate similarly titled non-GAAP measures differently or may use other measures to evaluate their performance, all of which could reduce the usefulness of our non-GAAP financial measures as tools for comparison.\nInvestors are encouraged to review the related GAAP financial measures and the reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to their most directly comparable GAAP financial measures and not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business.\nAdjusted Free Cash Flow is defined as free cash flow adjusted to include the impact of cash used to fund non-operating expenses. We believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to free cash flow applied in presenting adjusted free cash flow is appropriate to provide additional information to investors about our cash flows that management utilizes on an ongoing basis to assess our ability to generate cash for use in acquisitions and other investing and financing activities.\nFree Cash Flow is defined as U.S. GAAP net cash provided by operating activities adjusted to include the impact of purchases of property, plant, and equipment and purchases of badges.\n1 Note: Should this clarify whether it includes / excludes founder shares?2 Note to Mirion: Is this the most current list of forward-looking statements?

Go ahead, Mark.\nMark D. Roberson\nThanks, Jen, and thanks, everyone, for joining us today. As we wrap up 2022, and we're now well into 2023, I thought it makes sense to start by just recapping some of the takeaways from the past year and more importantly, how we're starting to see things shake up entering the new year. We finished 2022 with strong momentum in the fourth quarter. And as we'll discuss, we see that momentum continuing into 2023. I will start in the deck on Slides 3 and 4, if you're following along.First, we completed the name change in December, transitioning from Ballantyne Strong to FG Group Holdings. It's a small thing. But it's an important distinction as the new name better reflects our current and our future plans to operate as a holding company.We currently have capital allocated to 5 primary holdings. First, our Strong Entertainment operating business, which is the largest supplier of premium large-format screens and cinema services in North America and where we launched our new Studios business this year. We currently own 100% of Strong Entertainment. Our intent, as we've previously communicated, is to separate the entertainment business and will retain a majority but less than 100% stake going forward at the holding company. This is consistent with our holding company strategy, providing a more tangible measure of value in the future for that business and also allowing Strong Entertainment increased opportunity to capitalize on its growth potential and scale into a much larger company.We also hold less than 100% equity positions in 3 operating companies, FG Financial, Firefly, and GreenFirst Forest Products. And also in our Digital Emission business, we owned real estate with a 44,000 square foot building and 11 acres in the Atlanta area.Moving on to Slide 6, and our Strong Entertainment operating business to start with, we've seen customer demand and revenues bounced back strongly this year. Annual revenues are up over 50% and notably, Q4 revenue grew sequentially to come at the highest level of any quarter since COVID.On Slide 7, we signed new exclusive arrangements with many of the top exhibitors over the past several quarters, formalizing those already strong relationships. We supply AMC, Cinemark, Marcus and IMAX with all of their screens. And we've invested in building our sales and operations teams and increasing our market penetration and market share coming out of the pandemic. This puts Strong Entertainment in a much stronger position going forward, particularly as the industry continues to recover and exhibitors accelerate their investments to improve their properties and a theatrical experience. And especially as the upgrades to laser projection are accelerating and driving capital spending in the industry for the next several years.We're also expanding our global influence serving this growing industry. In Europe, for example, we established our finishing facility in Belgium recently, which enables expedited screen delivery and more streamlined import export for customers in Europe and the Middle East.We also see the international markets, Asia and Europe, in particular, really starting to improve in 2023 and going forward. If you happen to listen to IMAX's recent earnings call, for instance, a large portion of their commentary in their call was centered around the recovery they're now starting to see in the China market as that market is now more fully reopening and in other parts of China, of Asia, including new multiunit deals in Japan and in Asia, which is obviously great to see.Moving on to Slide 9. During 2022, we all saw cinema attendance levels in the overall Box Office revenue rebound. Box Office revenues were up well over 60% from 2021 and are now starting to trend much closer to pre-COVID levels looking into 2023 and 2024. For 2023, specifically, with film production now catching back up following the COVID-related delays, the Studio release calendar is even stronger in 2023 than what we just saw in 2022.Our largest customers are becoming more vocal in voicing their bullishness for strong 2023. A few examples, Cinemark, for example, sees new film releases increasing by over 30% from 2022, driving their internal growth expectations. AMC commented that they expect the number of movie titles in the theaters grossing over 100 million will increase by over 75% in 2023. And of course, IMAX is another example that's performed exceptionally well. And they're expecting their global box office in 2023 to more than exceed the 2019 levels. And they're also starting to ramp up expansion of new screens in their international markets once again.Overall, the industry backdrop was certainly much better in 2022 than in 2021. And we strengthened our position in the industry, which certainly helped propel our business to greater than 50% growth this year and put strong entertainment on solid footing going forward.Turning to Slide 10. The upgrades that we've discussed from Xenon to laser projection really started in earnest in the second half of this year. We're seeing AMC and Cinemark, in particular, leading the charge, upgrading their largest markets first. This is a really big deal for the industry. And it's expected to drive spending by cinema exhibitors for at least the next several years and particularly as the regional and international exhibitors began to commence their upgrade plans as well.We spent several years in R&D optimizing our screens and optimal coatings just for laser projection. And we're now the preferred screen and service partner for Cinionic, who is the leading manufacturer laser projectors. And as the market leader and exclusive provider, to, many of the large exhibitors, we believe we're well positioned as the upgrade cycle continues to accelerate.Turning now to Slide 11. This upgrade cycle that we've discussed is also one of the drivers to the growth we're seeing in our Technical Services Group, which grew 41% for the quarter. We continue to see more demand from cinemas looking to outsource this part of their business as their volumes ramp up.For example, we signed an exclusive multiyear nationwide managed service agreement with Marcus Theatres and we're continuing to add new customers for both managed services contracts as well as for on-demand work. We've also continued to expand our service offerings to better serve our customers' needs. With the laser upgrade demands increasing, we've been expanding our service team as well as our service offerings, providing more project management services and staffing up to increase our bandwidth for installations of laser screens, projection and audio equipment in the cinemas.Moving over to Slides 12 and 13. In addition to the screen and services business, we launched our new Strong Studios business this year, adding an entirely new growth vertical to the entertainment business. The Studios team has been very busy over the past several months. Inside the Black Box completed production and began hearing on the Crackle network in Q4. This project also represents the first revenue-producing project for our Studios business.We also wrapped production on Safehaven, which was a much larger project and we're now deep into postproduction. We expect episodes to be ready for delivery later this year. We see tremendous upside and growth potential in the new Studios business, both organically and potentially through M&A.Initially, we're taking a pretty conservative approach to the projects. And we'll lean towards utilizing coproduction and providing production services where we can generate revenue and minimize capital at risk while also creating the upside through the ownership of IP and participating in back-end revenue streams.Transitioning now, moving to our Equity Holdings on Slides 15 through 17. We're very excited about the value creation potential as the teams and those businesses continue to execute and positioned themselves for meaningful capital appreciation. At FG Financial, the merchant banking platform was launched this year. The reinsurance team completed 7 loss cap reinsurance contracts, top 5 integrity transactions were completed. And FG Merger Corp recently announced the business combination agreement with iCoreConnect.In the new Merchant Banking platform, the team has been busy announcing the creation of FG Communities, which is focused in the manufactured housing industry as well as the launch of Craveworthy with the former CEO of Jimmy John's as a multi-brand restaurant franchise platform.You recall; we acquired our stake in Firefly, a private venture-backed mobile media company when we contribute our taxi-top advertising business to invest alongside Google Ventures and FX 2 years ago. Post-pandemic, Firefly has seen exceptional growth in their business and they're now in over 10 major markets. This year, they entered the European market with the acquisition of the U.K.'s leading taxi advertising company.One key element of Firefly strategy that we were especially excited about is as they convert non-digital tops to digital that really multiplies the revenue potential as they continue to grow. We're excited about the team and the potential value they're creating.And then GreenFirst has evolved from a small Canadian shell to one of the leading lumber producers in Canada following our investment. Recently, they announced 2 transactions to monetize assets that we believe are very favorable to GreenFirst and to the ultimate value of our holding. In November, they announced the sale of their private forest land for $49 million. And then in December, they announced the sale of their 2 sawmills in Quebec for $90 million. Those transactions; further strengthen their balance sheet and allows management to focus on the more valuable Ontario operations.This industry continues to see quite a bit of M&A, so we're watching closely, so, overall, a really strong 2022, solid momentum coming at the end of the new year on all fronts.Todd, with that, would you like to walk us through the financials?\nTodd Robert Major\nSure. Thanks Mark. I'll start on Slide 19, which has our consolidated results for the quarter. Our results of operations continued to show meaningful improvements over the prior year, with revenue up 17%, gross profit up 52% and adjusted EBITDA up almost 180%. On the revenue side, Strong Entertainment delivered its strongest quarter in 3 years, surpassing the levels achieved in the final quarter of 2019. Our services business was the primary driver of the revenue increase from the prior year as we increased the scope of our services to better support our customers and to increase market share in cinema services.In addition, as Mark mentioned earlier, Strong Studios delivered its first project since it was launched and recorded $900,000 of revenue in the quarter. We had a large digital equipment order in the fourth quarter of 2021 that didn't repeat in 2022. But that was more than offset by higher sales of our higher-margin cinema screens, which led to the over 50% increase in gross profit and improved gross margin percentage.Adjusted EBITDA of $600,000 during the quarter from a negative $700,000 in the prior year is another positive sign that we are benefiting from the continuing momentum in the industry.Our year-end balance sheet is on Slide 20. Our equity holdings represent almost half the assets on our balance sheet with $37 million as of the end of the year. We ended the year with approximately $4 million in cash on our balance sheet. And our balance sheet also reflects the assets of our Strong Entertainment operating business and the real estate and our digital ignition business.We were able to slow working capital uses during the fourth quarter that occurred during the first 9 months of the year. And finally, our debt balance was approximately $8 million, primarily related to the real estate in Atlanta and strong MDI in Quebec.We amended our credit facility in Canada following the end of the year. The $3 million term loan and a $5 million revolving facility provide access to additional liquidity with increased limits based on the appreciated value of the Quebec real estate.As Mark previously stated, we're seeing positive momentum in our Strong Entertainment business as the industry continues to rebound and meaningful value creation potential in our equity holdings as the teams continue to execute against their strategy, which we expect to develop into significant capital appreciation.That wraps up the financial section. I'll now flip the call over to Kyle for some closing remarks.\nDaniel Kyle Cerminara\nThanks, Todd. The current economic environment presents numerous opportunities and challenges. And we're very pleased with how we've managed through the challenges over the last few years while also being conservatively positioned to act on opportunities as they come across our desk. We've taken many steps to transition to a holding company that we believe will create meaningful value for shareholders over the coming years. We're working judiciously to extract that value for shareholders. And we look forward to reporting back to you in the coming months and quarters on new developments.We will now open it up for the Q&A section. Please ask any question, we'll do our best to answer it.\nOperator\n(Operator Instructions) First question comes from Tyler Phillips with Elm Street Capital.\nTyler Phillips\nSo, I was wondering, how do you handle installation of your screens after they're sold, specifically do you outsource installation? Or do you handle that in-house?\nMark D. Roberson\nThanks, Tyler, this is Mark. Thanks for the question. It's a good question. And we may not be -- everyone may not know this. But traditionally, we've not actually provided screen installation services. We sell the screens and we provide lots of other services into the cinemas. But we have not historically actually installed the screens. They're usually handled by the cinemas using outsourced service providers. However, recently, in particular, we've had demand from customers, specifically in connection with the laser upgrades that they're embarking on to start providing. They've asked us, would you guys start providing those services so we can be more of a one-stop shop. So one of the things that we've been doing, and we started this midway through this year as we've started providing screen installation and we're starting to staff up that group. And it's one of the areas that we see as a real growth opportunity for the services business particularly in 2023 and then on into 2024.So it's an interesting -- good question and an interesting part of the business and there's other things like that. But it represents an area of service that we can provide to our customers and expand our service offerings and provide better service to our customers and grow the business.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Brett Reiss with Janney Montgomery.\nBrett Reiss\nGood results. Since the IPO window was closed, if you did need cash, what are the levers to raise cash does the company have available?\nMark D. Roberson\nYes. Brett, there are a number of levers. I mean, obviously, the need for cash is largely driven by the pace of our growth. We could -- if we were to accelerate growth much more rapidly, that may require even more capital. But we have a number of levers on our balance sheet and within our credit lines that we could utilize to provide additional capital.\nBrett Reiss\nWell, the building in Georgia, where do you think it's worth? And it's encumbered by what amount of mortgage? Is that a source of funding?\nMark D. Roberson\nIt could be -- go ahead, Kyle.\nDaniel Kyle Cerminara\nLet me answer that question. So there's a lot of different ways we can access capital. We have a building in Georgia that was purchased for a little over $8 million. It has -- Mark, correct me if this is wrong. But I believe it has about $5 million, give or take a few hundred thousand dollars of debt on it.\nMark D. Roberson\nYes, that's right.\nDaniel Kyle Cerminara\nSo it has -- at purchase price, it has a few million dollars of equity. I think we got a good price on that. It was -- there's a highway that is being developed, going literally like right through the backyard of the building. And by all measures, we believe that's going to significantly increase the value of the building. We have -- in addition to the building, there's land that we own in addition to the building that could be subdivided. And given the highways going through it's like there's going to -- it's not a highway like a major highway. It's a highway that you would have like a (inaudible) [00:21:05] or a gas station or other things like that that we're getting significant interest from developers to build things like fast food restaurants or gas stations or other things like that on our property.So there may be in the next few months to a year interest in either selling all of the land or some of the land -- and subdividing it, but I'd hate to put a number on it. I'd say if I was it's definitely worth more than $8 million, in my view, perhaps more than $10 million. But I'd be hesitant to say it's worth exactly $12 million or it's worth exactly $11 million because it's real estate. Like it could be worth $10 million, it could be worth $11 million or $12 million. But it's worth somewhere in the $8 million to $12 million range is my guess.And with that, we could be exploring selling that we could be developing that into a bigger business with this ambition. There's, all kinds of things that we could be doing with that. But I don't really think it's in our best interest to really to really explain exactly what we're going to do with that building until we've made the decision because we have lots of things going on inside of that building. So that is obviously one source of liquidity. If we wanted to, we could sell the building and we'd have $5 million or $6 million of cash net of the mortgage.Beyond that, we obviously have a very significant stake in GreenFirst Forest Products. They reported today as well. It looks like the stock didn't react that well to it. But we do expect GreenFirst Forest Products to be monetized at some point in 2023. That's our thesis. That's not me speaking with any information relative to that.But I do think that now that they've sold their Quebec mills they should be in a position to be a very attractive Ontario Mills sale. And we would think that that's something that could be explored in the near term. As a shareholder of GreenFirst Forest Products, we would expect the Board of GreenFirst to be exploring all options like that.And we would think that there should be some liquidity that GreenFirst in 2023 is our hope and our not just hope, we don't invest on hope. So that's where we think we'll see some significant liquidity at some point.Absent that, Mark mentioned that we do have access to millions of dollars of credit facilities and other ways of accessing liquidity. But we won't be issuing common equity, unless it's for something really special.Now you mentioned that the IPO market is shy. There have been a few IPOs that have gotten done recently. We would only do something if it made sense. But smaller IPOs are starting to get done. There's obviously the SPAC market. We do have FG Financial, where we know the SPAC market very well.So there are things that could be done. And you should expect that we're creative people. And we will be exploring all alternatives for that business. But when I look at strong global entertainment, the reason we want it to be a public company is not so that we can have a little small public company that is a $30 million, $40 million, $50 million market cap Company.It's so that we can do what we did with GreenFirst Forest Products, which is to merge with a much bigger entertainment company. And there's, a lot of other entertainment companies that will be very interesting for us to combine with and have a substantial several hundred million dollar or larger public companies. So that's the reason we want to explore a public listing is that we think that a publicly traded entertainment company with hundreds of millions of dollars of value is interesting, not so that we can have a little tiny microcap entertainment company.So I think that's been somewhat misunderstood by people. We're not looking to have like, a little tiny entertainment IPO. We do, at some point, the purpose of a public listing is to really have a currency either to consolidate the industry, which we think is an opportunity or to potentially do a SPAC transaction where maybe there's another entertainment company that could make sense.So we're looking at all options. And whether it's an IPO, a SPAC or a merger with a publicly traded entertainment company, there's a lot of things on the -- out there that could be done, and we're only going to do things that make sense, though. But I'm not concerned about liquidity at all.\nBrett Reiss\nI appreciate that color. Another 1 or 2, if I may. The $900,000 first project with Strong Entertainment, what project was that? And can we expect any recurring revenue from whatever that project was?\nMark D. Roberson\nYes, Brett, this is Mark. So that project was Inside the Black Box, which was our first revenue-producing project for the new business. So that project is going to be a little different than probably a lot of the projects that we'll do as Strong Studios. It represents a very limited half-hour series that we did for chicken soup with the salad. And we did that primarily on a services basis, where we managed the project on their behalf. It's a very limited series. It's not going to generate a lot of back in. But we can provide that service. We can generate some revenue, generate a decent amount of profitability on it with no capital, no risk. So it's something that we will do periodically. But it's a little different than the other projects that we've talked more about where we would have significant back-end participation on series that have the attitude for that.So I wouldn't necessarily expect to see it recur every quarter. But you'll see that from time to time because we'll fill in projects like that with other larger projects to help cover overhead and cover expenses as we grow the business.\nBrett Reiss\nRight, right. Mark, now that revenues are passed even pre-COVID levels. Where do you think in the next year or 2, gross profit margins should settle in that?\nMark D. Roberson\nI think we'll see -- we saw gross margin -- gross profit margins improved in Q4 from earlier in the year. It's still a little bit below where it was in the pre-COVID levels. And a lot of that has to do with product mix in terms of the mix of the business between our screen business, which is a highly profitable business and has higher margins as compared to when we sell third-party projector, projection equipment, audio equipment, et cetera. So that mix is still skewed a little heavier towards projection and audio and third-party product versus screens, but it's improving significantly through the period. And we see that continuing to improve as we look forward. I can't give you an exact timing or percentage on when that will occur. But we definitely see the trend on that moving in the right direction and you probably saw that in the Q4 numbers.\nBrett Reiss\nOkay. And just one last one. If the macroeconomic winds are blowing towards a severe recession, I mean, in the past, people still go to the movies during a recession. Are we in a business that's quasi-recession resistant or severe recession would be a headwind for us?\nMark D. Roberson\nI mean if you look at the past metrics on the box office during prior recessions and they're well publicized out there. There's, plenty of charts and graphs that kind of show the historical box office overlay it against recession years. You're right the box office generally has been quite recession resistant. And we'd expect that to continue to be the case, although we certainly can't predict that with accuracy. But I think when you look at entertainment and all the entertainment choices, the cinema; the movies are still a very affordable luxury entertainment item. And it's generally not affected as significantly in recessionary times.Then when we look -- I think the primary driver really of what we see going forward, and if you listen to AMC, IMAX, Cinemark and the other exhibitors on their earnings calls, they're really excited about the fact that the studio slate is during COVID, not only did certain projects get moved to streaming versus the cinemas, which has now shifted back.But the development of content was delayed because of COVID restrictions and COVID shutdowns. So that's really now just catching up to where the pipeline of studio releases is getting back closer to where it was pre-COVID, probably still not quite there. But they're expecting a much more favorable 2023 and 2024 from an availability of content to show in the theaters.\nBrett Reiss\nAnd good show on the fourth quarter and year-end results.\nOperator\nThe next question comes from Jim Merrick, Individual Investor.\nUnidentified Analyst\nThis is kind of a comment or maybe a question for Kyle. I know it's going to come out wrong. But I'm not quite sure how to rephrase it. When I was waiting for the meeting to start, I kind of look through some of the messages on the message board and look at some previous earnings report. And since Kyle and again has taken control of the company, the stock price has gone down. There was over $25 million in cash, around $25 million, I guess, in cash, down the building in Omaha, it was really valuable. And I have like some friends that hope to monetize on the stock at one time or",

    "summary": "President Joe Biden delivered his 2023 State of the Union address on Tuesday, touching on issues like inflation, infrastructure and health care.\nThe speech was Biden's second State of the Union address since taking office in January 2021. (He gave a speech to a joint session of Congress that year, but it was not an official State of the Union.)\nWith Vice President Kamala Harris and House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) behind him, Biden took to the podium and began his remarks just after 9 p.m. ET.\nBelow, read Biden's State of the Union address, as prepared for delivery:\nMr. Speaker. Madam Vice President. Our First Lady and Second Gentleman.Members of Congress and the Cabinet. Leaders of our military.Mr. Chief Justice, Associate Justices, and retired Justices of the Supreme Court.And you, my fellow Americans.I start tonight by congratulating the members of the 118th Congress and the new Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy.Mr. Speaker, I look forward to working together.I also want to congratulate the new leader of the House Democrats and the first Black House Minority Leader in history, Hakeem Jeffries.Congratulations to the longest serving Senate Leader in history, Mitch McConnell.And congratulations to Chuck Schumer for another term as Senate Majority Leader, this time with an even bigger majority.And I want to give special recognition to someone who I think will be considered the greatest Speaker in the history of this country, Nancy Pelosi.The story of America is a story of progress and resilience. Of always moving forward. Of never giving up.A story that is unique among all nations.We are the only country that has emerged from every crisis stronger than when we entered it.That is what we are doing again.Two years ago, our economy was reeling.As I stand here tonight, we have created a record 12 million new jobs, more jobs created in two years than any president has ever created in four years.Two years ago, COVID had shut down our businesses, closed our schools, and robbed us of so much.Today, COVID no longer controls our lives.And two years ago, our democracy faced its greatest threat since the Civil War.Today, though bruised, our democracy remains unbowed and unbroken.As we gather here tonight, we are writing the next chapter in the great American story, a story of progress and resilience. When world leaders ask me to define America, I define our country in one word: Possibilities.You know, we're often told that Democrats and Republicans can't work together.But over these past two years, we proved the cynics and the naysayers wrong.Yes, we disagreed plenty. And yes, there were times when Democrats had to go it alone.But time and again, Democrats and Republicans came together.Came together to defend a stronger and safer Europe.Came together to pass a once-in-a-generation infrastructure law, building bridges to connect our nation and people.Came together to pass one of the most significant laws ever, helping veterans exposed to toxic burn pits.In fact, I signed over 300 bipartisan laws since becoming President. From reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act, to the Electoral Count Reform Act, to the Respect for Marriage Act that protects the right to marry the person you love.To my Republican friends, if we could work together in the last Congress, there is no reason we can't work together in this new Congress.The people sent us a clear message. Fighting for the sake of fighting, power for the sake of power, conflict for the sake of conflict, gets us nowhere.And that's always been my vision for our country.To restore the soul of the nation.To rebuild the backbone of America, the middle class.To unite the country.We've been sent here to finish the job.For decades, the middle class was hollowed out.Too many good-paying manufacturing jobs moved overseas. Factories at home closed down.Once-thriving cities and towns became shadows of what they used to be.And along the way, something else was lost.Pride. That sense of self-worth.I ran for President to fundamentally change things, to make sure the economy works for everyone so we can all feel pride in what we do.To build an economy from the bottom up and the middle out, not from the top down. Because when the middle class does well, the poor have a ladder up and the wealthy still do very well. We all do well.As my Dad used to say, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck. It's about your dignity. It's about respect. It's about being able to look your kid in the eye and say, 'Honey \u2013it's going to be OK,' and mean it.So, let's look at the results. Unemployment rate at 3.4%, a 50-year low. Near record low unemployment for Black and Hispanic workers.We've already created 800,000 good-paying manufacturing jobs, the fastest growth in 40 years.Where is it written that America can't lead the world in manufacturing again?For too many decades, we imported products and exported jobs.Now, thanks to all we've done, we're exporting American products and creating American jobs.Inflation has been a global problem because of the pandemic that disrupted supply chains and Putin's war that disrupted energy and food supplies.But we're better positioned than any country on Earth.We have more to do, but here at home, inflation is coming down.Here at home, gas prices are down $1.50 a gallon since their peak.Food inflation is coming down.Inflation has fallen every month for the last six months while take home pay has gone up.Additionally, over the last two years, a record 10 million Americans applied to start a new small business.Every time somebody starts a small business, it's an act of hope.And the Vice President will continue her work to ensure more small businesses can access capital and the historic laws we enacted.Standing here last year, I shared with you a story of American genius and possibility.Semiconductors, the small computer chips the size of your fingertip that power everything from cellphones to automobiles, and so much more. These chips were invented right here in America.America used to make nearly 40% of the world's chips.But in the last few decades, we lost our edge and we're down to producing only 10%. We all saw what happened during the pandemic when chip factories overseas shut down.Today's automobiles need up to 3,000 chips each, but American automakers couldn't make enough cars because there weren't enough chips.Car prices went up. So did everything from refrigerators to cellphones.We can never let that happen again.That's why we came together to pass the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act.We're making sure the supply chain for America begins in America.We've already created 800,000 manufacturing jobs even without this law.With this new law, we will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs across the country.That's going to come from companies that have announced more than $300 billion in investments in American manufacturing in the last two years.Outside of Columbus, Ohio, Intel is building semiconductor factories on a thousand acres \u2013 a literal field of dreams.That'll create 10,000 jobs. 7,000 construction jobs. 3,000 jobs once the factories are finished.Jobs paying $130,000 a year, and many don't require a college degree.Jobs where people don't have to leave home in search of opportunity.And it's just getting started.Think about the new homes, new small businesses, and so much more that will come to life.Talk to mayors and Governors, Democrats and Republicans, and they'll tell you what this means to their communities.We're seeing these fields of dreams transform the heartland.But to maintain the strongest economy in the world, we also need the best infrastructure in the world.We used to be #1 in the world in infrastructure, then we fell to #13th.Now we're coming back because we came together to pass the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, the largest investment in infrastructure since President Eisenhower's Interstate Highway System.Already, we've funded over 20,000 projects, including at major airports from Boston to Atlanta to Portland.These projects will put hundreds of thousands of people to work rebuilding our highways, bridges, railroads, tunnels, ports and airports, clean water, and high-speed internet across America.Urban. Suburban. Rural. Tribal.And we're just getting started. I sincerely thank my Republican friends who voted for the law.And to my Republican friends who voted against it but still ask to fund projects in their districts, don't worry.I promised to be the president for all Americans.We'll fund your projects. And I'll see you at the ground-breaking.This law will help further unite all of America.Major projects like the Brent Spence bridge between Kentucky and Ohio over the Ohio River. Built 60 years ago. Badly in need of repairs.One of the nation's most congested freight routes carrying $2 billion worth of freight every day. Folks have been talking about fixing it for decades, but we're finally going to get it done.I went there last month with Democrats and Republicans from both states to deliver $1.6 billion for this project.While I was there, I met an ironworker named Sara, who is here tonight.For 30 years, she's been a proud member of Ironworkers Local 44, known as the 'cowboys of the sky' who built the Cincinnati skyline.Sara said she can't wait to be ten stories above the Ohio River building that new bridge. That's pride.That's what we're also building \u2013 Pride.We're also replacing poisonous lead pipes that go into 10 million homes and 400,000 schools and childcare centers, so every child in America can drink clean water.We're making sure that every community has access to affordable, high-speed internet.No parent should have to drive to a McDonald's parking lot so their kid can do their homework online.And when we do these projects, we're going to Buy American.Buy American has been the law of the land since 1933. But for too long, past administrations have found ways to get around it.Not anymore.Tonight, I'm also announcing new standards to require all construction materials used in federal infrastructure projects to be made in America.American-made lumber, glass, drywall, fiber optic cables.And on my watch, American roads, American bridges, and American highways will be made with American products.My economic plan is about investing in places and people that have been forgotten. Amid the economic upheaval of the past four decades, too many people have been left behind or treated like they're invisible.Maybe that's you, watching at home.You remember the jobs that went away. And you wonder whether a path even exists anymore for you and your children to get ahead without moving away.I get it.That's why we're building an economy where no one is left behind.Jobs are coming back, pride is coming back, because of the choices we made in the last two years. This is a blue-collar blueprint to rebuild America and make a real difference in your lives.For example, too many of you lay in bed at night staring at the ceiling, wondering what will happen if your spouse gets cancer, your child gets sick, or if something happens to you.Will you have the money to pay your medical bills? Will you have to sell the house?I get it. With the Inflation Reduction Act that I signed into law, we're taking on powerful interests to bring your health care costs down so you can sleep better at night.You know, we pay more for prescription drugs than any major country on Earth.For example, one in ten Americans has diabetes.Every day, millions need insulin to control their diabetes so they can stay alive. Insulin has been around for 100 years. It costs drug companies just $10 a vial to make.But, Big Pharma has been unfairly charging people hundreds of dollars \u2013 and making record profits.Not anymore.We capped the cost of insulin at $35 a month for seniors on Medicare.But there are millions of other Americans who are not on Medicare, including 200,000 young people with Type I diabetes who need insulin to save their lives.Let's finish the job this time.Let's cap the cost of insulin at $35 a month for every American who needs it.This law also caps out-of-pocket drug costs for seniors on Medicare at a maximum $2,000 per year when there are in fact many drugs, like expensive cancer drugs, that can cost up to $10,000, $12,000, and $14,000 a year.If drug prices rise faster than inflation, drug companies will have to pay Medicare back the difference.And we're finally giving Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. Bringing down prescription drug costs doesn't just save seniors money.It will cut the federal deficit, saving tax payers hundreds of billions of dollars on the prescription drugs the government buys for Medicare.Why wouldn't we want to do that?Now, some members here are threatening to repeal the Inflation Reduction Act.Make no mistake, if you try to do anything to raise the cost of prescription drugs, I will veto it.I'm pleased to say that more Americans have health insurance now than ever in history.A record 16 million people are enrolled under the Affordable Care Act.Thanks to the law I signed last year, millions are saving $800 a year on their premiums.But the way that law was written, that benefit expires after 2025.Let's finish the job, make those savings permanent, and expand coverage to those left off Medicaid.Look, the Inflation Reduction Act is also the most significant investment ever to tackle the climate crisis.Lowering utility bills, creating American jobs, and leading the world to a clean energy future.I've visited the devastating aftermaths of record floods and droughts, storms and wildfires.In addition to emergency recovery from Puerto Rico to Florida to Idaho, we are rebuilding for the long term.New electric grids able to weather th",
