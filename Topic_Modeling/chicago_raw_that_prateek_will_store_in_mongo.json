            "summary": "When deciding where to live, whether through renting or buying, it's crucial to consider housing expenses and overall financial situations. Which option aligns better with the budget of the typical U.S. worker? According to ATTOM's 2024 Rental Affordability Report, the median rent for a three-bedroom home is more affordable than owning a similarly-sized house in nearly 90% of local markets nationwide.\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Photo by PhotoMIX Company | Pexels\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read\n: \n5 ChatGPT Prompts That Can Help Businessowners Be More Present \n\n\n\n\nThe report highlights that both renting and owning a three-bedroom home pose significant financial challenges for average workers, using over one-third of their wages in most county-level housing markets. However, median rental rates take up a smaller portion of average wages compared to major homeownership expenses in 88% of the 338 U.S. counties analyzed.\n\n\nThis trend continues into 2023, even though rents have increased more rapidly than home prices in the past year in the U.S.\n\n\n\"Rising home prices contribute to the escalation of rental costs, making both buying and renting challenging across most of the United States,\" explains Rob Barber, CEO at ATTOM. \"However, recent data shows that despite rent increases, renting remains more affordable than owning.\"\n\n\nSo, does the preference for renting over buying reflect housing market trends that offer limited, straightforward options for home shoppers but ultimately lean towards the advantage of rentals?\n\n\nAlso Read\n: \nAt Least 66% of Americans Don't Like Tipping, 41% Expect Businesses To Pay Their Employees Better: Survey\n\n\n\n\nThe report indicates that in 2023, rental rates and home prices increased in most of the U.S., with rental rates climbing even faster in the majority of counties analyzed. Elevated home prices have become \"further and further out of reach\" for average workers, limiting their ability to obtain mortgages and leaving them with few alternatives other than renting.\n\n\n\n\nAlso Read\n: \nHere's why Post-Pandemic Resumption of Student Loan Repayments Could Help People Save Taxes\n\n\n\n\n1. Rent Changes vs. Home Price Trends\n\n\n- Rents are rising faster than home prices in almost two-thirds of the U.S.\n- Median rents for three-bedroom homes increased more or declined less than median prices for single-family homes in 62% of the 338 counties analyzed.\n \n2. Affordability Gaps in Populous Counties\n\n\n- The most populous counties show significant affordability gaps between renting and owning.\n- Renting a three-bedroom home will be more affordable in 2024 compared to owning a median-priced single-family home in nearly three-quarters of markets with populations over one million.\n\n\n\n\nA general view of properties at North Lakes | Getty Images | Photo by Glenn Hunt\n\n\n\n\n3. Regional Affordability\n\n\n\u00a0- Renting three-bedroom homes is most affordable in the South and Midwest.\n- In 81% of analyzed counties, median three-bedroom rents require over one-third of the average local wage.\n\n\n4. Home Ownership Affordability\n\n\n- The most affordable homeownership markets are in the South and Midwest.\n- The least affordable ownership markets are in the West and Northeast.\n\n\n5. Specific Counties' Affordability\n\n\n\u00a0 Top Five Most Affordable Southern and Midwest Counties for Owning:\n\n\n- Jefferson County (Birmingham), AL\n- Wayne County (Detroit), MI\n- Ingham County (Lansing), MI\n- Genesee County (Flint), MI\n- Caddo Parish (Shreveport), LA\n\n\nMost Affordable Southern and Midwest Counties for Renting (among those with a population of at least 1 million and excluding Wayne County):\n\n\n- Cuyahoga County (Cleveland), OH\n- St. Louis County, MO\n- Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), PA\n- Philadelphia County, PA\n\n\n6. Home Price Trends in 2023\n\n\n\u00a0- Home prices continued to rise in 2023 despite higher mortgage rates, mainly due to a tight supply of homes for sale.\n\n\nRent Increases Outpacing Wage Growth in Majority of Markets\n\n\nIn 58% of the 338 analyzed counties, rents for median three-bedroom homes are growing faster than average local wages. Notable examples include Los Angeles County, CA; Harris County (Houston), TX; Maricopa County (Phoenix), AZ; San Diego County, CA; and Orange County, CA (outside Los Angeles).\n\n\nConversely, wages are outpacing rent growth in 42% of counties, encompassing areas like Cook County (Chicago), IL; Kings County (Brooklyn), NY; Miami-Dade County, FL; Queens County, NY; and San Bernardino County, CA.\n\n\n\n\nImage Source: Photo by energepic.com | Pexels\n\n\n \nNationwide, wages are growing faster than home prices in almost 60% of the country. This reversal of the 2023 trend is observed in 58% of the analyzed counties, including Los Angeles County, CA; Cook County (Chicago), IL; Harris County (Houston), TX; Maricopa County (Phoenix), AZ; and San Diego County, CA.\n\n\nHowever, in 42% of the counties, median home prices are rising faster than average weekly wages. Examples include Orange County, CA (outside Los Angeles); Kings County (Brooklyn), NY; Miami-Dade County, FL; Broward County (Fort Lauderdale), FL; and Middlesex County, MA (outside Boston).\n \n\"Finding an affordable home remains a daunting prospect for average workers nationwide, whether they opt to buy or rent,\" expressed Barber, emphasizing the ongoing difficulty in securing affordable housing.\n\n\nRegardless of the choice between renting or buying, financial considerations are crucial. The quest for suitable housing continues to be a challenge for most Americans, with hopes for a more streamlined process throughout 2024.",

Titled 'Even Better Than the Real Thing,' this year's iteration of the Biennial is curated by Chrissie Iles, who organized the 2004 and 2006 editions of the event, and Meg Onli. The pair will be assisted by Taja Cheek in organizing the performance program and by Korakrit Arunanondchai, asinnajaq, Greg de Cuir Jr., and Zackary Drucker in assembling the film program.\n\n'We understand we're in a turbulent period, leading into another turbulent period,' Onli told the New York Times. Creating an exhibition within this landscape meant that 'the show had to be politically charged.' Though the biennial survey has historically focused mainly on American artists, this year about 28 percent of the cohort hails from outside the US.\n\n'Society is at an inflection point . . . in part brought on by artificial intelligence challenging what we consider to be real, as well as critical discussions about identity,' said the curators in a joint statement. 'Many of the artists presenting works\u2014including via robust performance and film programs\u2014explore the fluidity of identity and form, historical and current land stewardship, and concepts of embodiment, among other urgent throughlines, and we are inspired by the work they are creating and sharing.'\n\nA full list of participating artists and collectives is below.\n\nVisual Artists\n\nEddie Rodolfo Aparicio (he/him)\n\nBorn 1990 in Los Angeles\n\nLives in Los Angeles\n\n\n\nDora Budor (she/her)\n\nBorn 1984 in Zagreb, Croatia\n\nLives in New York\n\n\n\nSeba Calfuqueo (she/her/they/them)\n\nBorn 1991 in Santiago, Chile\n\nLives in Ngulumapu, Wallmapu (Chile)\n\n\n\nDemian Din\u00e9Yazhi' (they/them)\n\nBorn 1983 in Gallup, NM, (Din\u00e9 Bik\u00e9yah [Navajo Nation])\n\nLives in Portland, OR, and elsewhere\n\n\n\nTorkwase Dyson (she/her)\n\nBorn 1973 in Chicago\n\nLives in Beacon, NY\n\n\n\nJJJJJerome Ellis (any/all)\n\nBorn 1989 in Groton, CT\n\nLives in Norfolk, VA\n\n\n\nJes Fan (he/him/they/them)\n\nBorn 1990 in Scarborough, Canada\n\nLives in Brooklyn, NY, and Hong Kong\n\n\n\nNikita Gale\n\nBorn 1983 in Anchorage, AK, D\u00ebn\u00e9ndeh and Dena'ina E\u0142nena\n\nLives in Los Angeles\n\n\n\nektor garcia\n\nBorn 1985 in Red Bluff, CA\n\nLives in Mexico City and elsewhere\n\n\n\nPippa Garner (she/her)\n\nBorn 1942 in Evanston, IL\n\nLives in Long Beach, CA\n\n\n\nHarmony Hammond (she/her)\n\nBorn 1944 in Chicago\n\nLives in Galisteo, NM\n\n\n\nSharon Hayes (she/her)\n\nBorn 1970 in Baltimore\n\nLives in Philadelphia\n\n\n\nHolly Herndon and Mat Dryhurst\n\nHolly Herndon (she/her)\n\nBorn 1980 in Johnson City, TN\n\nLives in Berlin\n\nMat Dryhurst (he/him)\n\nBorn 1984 in Birmingham, UK\n\nLives in Berlin\n\n\n\nMadeleine Hunt-Ehrlich (she/her)\n\nBorn 1987 in New York\n\nLives in New York\n\n\n\nSuzanne Jackson (she/her)\n\nBorn 1944 in St. Louis\n\nLives in Savannah, GA\n\n\n\nIsaac Julien\n\nBorn 1960 in London\n\nLives in London and Santa Cruz, CA\n\n\n\nLotus L.

Wherever you are, you will always be in my heart.Mahatma GandhiMary Lou Schnorf passed away on January 24, 2024, at Atria Merrimack Place with her family close by. Mary Lou was born in Winnipeg Manitoba, Canada on March 15, 1929, the only child of Arnold and Olive (Lindsay) McCormick. After attending high school in Regina, she went on to graduate from the University of Saskatchewan. The draw of warmer climes led her to San Francisco where she worked as a hospital laboratory technician. She fell in love with the city and with her future husband, Ernest H. Schnorf of Kuesnacht, Switzerland. They married in San Francisco in 1953 and Mary Lou gave birth to her two daughters there before moves with her husband led to homes in Hamburg, Germany, Chicago, IL, Vevey, Switzerland and finally 26 years of retirement living in her much-loved Marin County, CA. Her husband Ernie passed away there in 2015. Mary Lou moved to Newburyport in 2016 to live with her daughter Barbara and son-in-law Paul. She took great pleasure in the company of their sweet dog Cito and delighted in the abundant nature of the area. Mary Lou was an avid reader and traveler, puzzler, cook and baker and loved exploring art and history. Golf was her sport early in life, later she enjoyed hiking and birding in Marin. Entertaining and spending time with her dear friends in Lagunitas brought her much joy.Mary Lou is survived by her daughter Barbara and son-in-law Paul Benoit with Cito of Newburyport MA, and daughter Kathryn of Herrliberg, Switzerland. We are thankful for all she gave us love, comfort, encouragement, freedom and for all of herself she shared with us a lively curiosity, her humor and generosity, a strong will, her love of dogs and delight in nature. We will miss her terribly. Our gratitude goes to the memory care team in Life Guidance at Atria and the Compassus hospice staff for their tender, respectful and supportive care.According to Mary Lou's wishes, there will be no services. The Twomey, LeBlanc & Conte Funeral Home in Newburyport is assisting with her arrangements. If you would like to donate in Mary Lou's memory, please support the Audubon Canyon Ranch in Stinson Beach, CA via egret.org/donate To offer online condolences please visit www.tlcfuneralhome.com",

Train's climb to the top began in 1994, as the original 5-member band tenaciously built a loyal hometown following, leading up to their debut self-titled album released by Columbia in 1998. The tumbling wordplay of \"Meet Virginia'' gave them their first unlikely radio hit, and 2001's Drops of Jupiter broke them to multi-platinum status thanks to the double-GRAMMY-winning title song that spent 10 months in the Top 40, has been certified RIAA 7x platinum, and earned the 2001 GRAMMY Award for Best Rock Song. The group won another GRAMMY in 2011 for their global hit 'Hey, Soul Sister'' from their multi-platinum album Save Me, San Francisco (2009), which was the No.1 best-selling smash and most downloaded single of 2010, achieved RIAA Diamond status in 2021 and now 11x platinum, and in 2022 surpassed one billion streams on Spotify. Train has sold more than 10 million albums and 30 million tracks worldwide, with multiple platinum/gold citations, including three GRAMMY Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, and dozens of other honors. They've had 24 Top 10 songs across the Billboard charts and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart including Drops of Jupiter (2001), My Private Nation (2003), California 37 (2012), Bulletproof Picasso(2014), For Me, It's You (2016), and a girl a bottle a boat (2017). Train released their critically acclaimed 11th studio album, AM Gold, in May 2022 and most recently released a new song \"I Know\" ft. Tenille Townes and Bryce Vine, which marked their 27th career entry on Billboard's Adult Pop Airplay chart.\n\nTrain frontman, Pat Monahan, partakes in other ventures outside of music, including his award-winning wine portfolio, Save Me, San Francisco Wine Co, which was created in 2011 and has sold over 10 million bottles and won over 100 medals. Proceeds from his wine business support Family House, a San Francisco charity that supports families of children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. Monahan has appeared on television and in film with credits that include the 2021 Hallmark Channel original movie, Christmas in Tahoe, inspired by Train's album of the same name, which he executive produced and starred, Dr. Ken, 90210, CBS's Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum P.I., The Voice, American Idol, and The Bachelor.\n\nAbout REO Speedwagon\n\nFormed in 1967, signed in 1971, and fronted by iconic vocalist Kevin Cronin since 1972, REO Speedwagon's unrelenting drive, as well as non-stop touring and recording jump-started the burgeoning rock movement in the Midwest. Platinum albums and radio staples soon followed, setting the stage for the release of the band's explosive Hi Infidelity in 1980, which contained the massive hit singles 'Keep On Loving You' and 'Take It On the Run.' That landmark album spent 15 weeks in the No. 1 slot and has since earned the RIAA's coveted 10X Diamond Award for surpassing sales of 10 million units in the United States.\n\nFrom 1977 to 1989, REO Speedwagon released nine consecutive albums all certified Platinum or higher. To date, REO Speedwagon has sold more than 40 million albums around the globe, and Cronin and bandmates Bruce Hall, Dave Amato, Bryan Hitt, Derek Hilland, and most recent addition Matt Bissonette, are electrifying audiences worldwide in concert with hits and fan-favorites such as 'Ridin' The Storm Out,' 'Can't Fight This Feeling,' 'Time For Me To Fly,' 'Roll With The Changes,' 'Keep On Loving You,' 'Take It On the Run,' and many, many more. More recently, REO has been featured in Season Three of the hit Netflix series, Ozark, with an episode entitled: 'Kevin Cronin Was Here.' Cronin sang a duet with Dolly Parton on his number-one hit, 'Keep on Loving You' for her star-studded Rockstar album, which featured a who's who of rock luminaries including Sir Paul McCartney, Elton John, and Sting, to mention just a few. Cronin performed on the 2022 season finale of American Idol, is a regular guest with the Jim Irsay Collection band, and is currently putting the finishing touches on his memoir, 'Roll With The Changes\u2026 my life within and without REO Speedwagon.' REO Speedwagon launched their first Las Vegas residency in November of 2023, the sold-out 'An Evening of Hi Infidelity \u2026and More!,' with return engagements set for May, and again in October of 2024. The band is active in numerous charitable endeavors including the Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health, Music Drives Us, and Moffitt Cancer Center.\n\nAbout Yacht Rock Revue\n\nStep aboard a musical voyage like no other with Yacht Rock Revue!

            "summary": "CHAMPAIGN \u2014 Concerned community members and postal workers are trying to raise awareness about the U.S. Postal Service's review of the northwest Champaign post office.\nA kickoff event for the 'Save the Post Office' campaign will be held at 1 p.m. Sunday at the Urbana-Champaign Independent Media Center in downtown Urbana.\n \n'We're concerned about the mail being delayed even more than it already is,' said Barbara Bridges, an employee at the Champaign Processing and Distribution Center at 2001 N. Mattis Ave. 'We're already experiencing staffing shortages, and if our mail is sent up to Chicago for processing, it's only going to delay the mail further.'\nBridges, who does not represent the post office or the local chapter of the American Postal Workers Union, said that a coalition of workers and people from local community groups organized the meeting to raise awareness about an upcoming public hearing that is part of the review process.\nDuring the Sunday event, the IMC's Gus Wood will deliver a presentation on the history and relevance of the Postal Service, and the president of the local union chapter will also be present, she said.\nAccording to a notice from the Postal Service, community members can submit comments regarding the Mattis Avenue facility at survey- \nmonkey.com/r/mpfr\n- champaign-il.\n'If the facility review supports the business case for change to the facility's processing operations, USPS will hold a public meeting to allow members of the local community to provide additional feedback,' officials wrote.\nA summary of the review will be posted on \nabout.usps.com\n at least one week prior to the public-input meeting.\n \nA list of facilities undergoing reviews \u2014 along with related documents such as initial findings and public-meeting notices \u2014 is available at \nabout.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/mpfr/welcome.htm\n.\nThe Postal Service has yet to post a notice for a public meeting for the northwest Champaign post office.\nAccording to its notice about the review, the Postal Service plans to consider whether efficiency could be enhanced by transferring some of the mail-processing operations performed at the Champaign facility to similar facilities in Chicago and its south suburbs.\nAdditionally, officials said that if they decide to move some mail-processing operations away from the Champaign facility, it is 'highly likely' that it 'will be modernized and repurposed as a Local Processing Center, a Sorting and Delivery Center or both, consistent with the broader network redesign.'\nLocal Processing Centers are 'critical nodes' in the Postal Service's end-to-end network model, the agency said, providing a connection between Regional Processing and Distribution Centers and Sorting and Delivery Centers.\n'Within a region, S&DCs will expand our network reach,' officials added, saying they will 'aggregate delivery units into fewer, larger and centrally located sites to provide faster and more reliable mail and package delivery over a greater geographic area, as compared to traditional delivery units.'\n \nBridges claimed that many local postal workers will be displaced if the local facility becomes a Local Processing Center or a Sorting and Delivery Center.\n'If we lose our outgoing mail to Chicago, many of our sorting machines will be dismantled,' she said. 'Many of our techs, clerks and mail handlers will have to move to other cities to keep their jobs, or else be forced out of their chosen craft into other roles.'\nThe Postal Service has stated that the review will not result in the facility's closure or 'career-employee layoffs.'\nWhen asked what the term 'career employee' means, Bridges explained that there is a two-tier system for Postal Service employees, with newer employees being part of a lower tier. She estimated that this lasts for about a year and a half to two years.\n'I don't think that the people at the lower tier have any job security,' she said.\nShe added that the consolidation of carriers into Sorting and Delivery Centers will mean that instead of a semitrailer delivering presorted mail from the Mattis Avenue facility to other post offices in the area, letter carriers will have to drive up to an hour to get their mail from the Sorting and Delivery Center, then return to their routes to deliver it.\n \n'This will mean that either they will have to make two round trips each day, or they will have to leave the mail they've collected sitting overnight at the local post office until they come back the next day,' she said. 'Either way, it will most certainly delay the mail by an extra day.'\nAt the national level, the postal workers union has expressed similar concerns about the agency's changes slowing down mail delivery.\nBridges also fears that the consolidation of pick-up and drop-off points at Sorting and Delivery Centers could lead to reduced operating hours at rural post offices and 'a possible escalation of local post office closures.'",

            "summary": "CHAMPAIGN \u2014 The U.S. Postal Service will consider the community's feedback in its review of a local post office's operations.\nThe agency is conducting a review of the Champaign Processing and Distribution Center at 2001 N. Mattis Ave., U.S. Postal Service spokesman Tim Norman said.\nAccording to a notice from the Postal Service, members of the local community can submit comments at \nsurveymonkey.com/r/mpfr-champaign-il\n.\n \n'If the facility review supports the business case for change to the facility's processing operations, USPS will hold a public meeting to allow members of the local community to provide additional feedback,' officials wrote.\nA summary of the review will be posted on \nabout.usps.com\n at least one week prior to the public-input meeting.\nA list of facilities undergoing reviews \u2014 along with related documents such as initial findings and public-meeting notices \u2014 is available at \nabout.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/mpfr/welcome.htm\n. Peoria's processing and distribution center is also under review.\nAccording to an FAQ document about the Champaign review, studies are only just now beginning, and the agency anticipates sharing its initial findings in the next month or two.\nThe review of the Champaign facility is part of the Postal Service's 10-year, $40 billion strategic Delivering for America Plan to 'modernize' its network, officials said. The review will not result in the facility's closure or career employee layoffs.\n'This specific facility review will inform the best allocation of resources and strategies to improve customer service and to achieve significant cost savings through operational precision and efficiency,' the agency stated. 'Business mail entry, post office, station and branch retail services are not expected to change, and delivery services will be unaffected throughout this review. The modernization evaluation is a first step in the Postal Service review and investment process in this facility.'\nDuring the review, the Postal Service will evaluate three main pieces. The first is whether efficiency could be enhanced by transferring some of the mail-processing operations performed at the Champaign center to the South Suburban and Chicago regional processing and distribution centers.\n'A significant percentage of the mail collected in Champaign will travel across our wider transportation and processing network over significant distances to reach their final destinations,' officials said. 'Mail and packages destined for outside the Champaign area may receive better service and be more cost effectively distributed by aggregating it with mail and packages from other areas going to the same places that will likewise utilize the wider postal network and be transported significant distances from where the mail originated.'\n \nAdditionally, the Postal Service will work to determine whether operations can be improved by investing in the Champaign facility to redesign mail processing to 'accommodate changing mail products and mail flow with modern operating strategies, equipment and improved employee amenities.'\nThe review will also consider whether efficiency or service can be enhanced by expanding operations at the facility. This could include adding sorting and delivery functions, incorporating expanded retail functions and/or 'increasing local package-delivery functions including local transportation initiatives supporting new products being introduced.'\n'While it may be determined that moving some mail-processing operations from the Champaign P&DC is a good business decision, it is highly likely under those circumstances that the Champaign facility will be modernized and repurposed as a Local Processing Center, a Sorting and Delivery Center or both, consistent with the broader network redesign,' Postal Service officials said. 'Any such repurposing will result in a revitalized, modernized and upgraded facility with improved employee amenities and a better working environment.'\nLocal Processing Centers are 'critical nodes' in the Postal Service's end-to-end network model, the agency said, providing a connection between Regional Processing and Distribution Centers and Sorting and Delivery Centers.\n'Within a region, S&DCs will expand our network reach,' officials added, saying they will 'aggregate delivery units into fewer, larger and centrally located sites to provide faster and more reliable mail and package delivery over a greater geographic area, as compared to traditional delivery units.'",

Taking myself specifically far outside of my comfort zone and pushing the boundaries on how I've been seen in the past was a creative experience I will never forget. This video wouldn't be what it is without the collaboration with \nEric Richter\n, someone we've admired for a while. And the songs wouldn't be what they are without [producer] \nDrew Fulk\n, a new friend and creative ear in the entire process.\"\n\"Deep In The Willow\"\n and \n\"Everything Is Quiet Now\"\n were the first new \nKNOCKED LOOSE\n singles since the release of the band's 2021 EP and head-turning short film \n\"A Tear In The Fabric Of Life\"\n. The release garnered worldwide acclaim from \nRolling Stone\n, \nPitchfork\n, \nNPR\n, \nThe Needle Drop\n, \nThe Guardian\n, \nThe Fader\n, \nStereogum\n, \nDecibel\n, \nRevolver\n, so on and established \nKNOCKED LOOSE\n as a staple across modern punk, hardcore and metal scenes.\nIn 2023, \nKNOCKED LOOSE\n stunned \nCoachella\n goers with their unforgettable performance which claimed the biggest circle pit in the festival's history.\nPhoto credit: \nPerri Leigh\n Find more on \nKnocked loose",

'I don't like that people are upset a little bit about it.\n'If I were waiting for a thing for 17 years, a certain thing that I'm looking for and something else shows up, I'd probably be upset too. To be a rapper, you gotta be rapping. I haven't been rapping, like I don't hang around the studio.'\nHe added: 'I don't sit and try to rap every day like when I was younger, and that's all I did.

            "summary": "Justin Timberlake\n is all set to hit the road for the first time in five years as he prepares to drop his next album this spring.\nOn Friday (January 26), the 42-year-old singer and dancer unveiled the itinerary for his Forget Tomorrow World Tour across North America. The 22-date trek commences on April 29 with a show in Vancouver, Canada and concludes on July 9 in Lexington, Kentucky.\nBefore the concert series kicks off, the \nNSYNC\n heartthrob will release his sixth studio album. \nEverything I Thought It Was\n is currently scheduled to drop on March 15, with \nits first single\n premiering earlier this week.\nCheck out the list of performances JT has planned for later this year. The singer promised 'more to come':\nIt's been six years since Justin Timberlake dropped a full-length project. \nMan of the Woods\n, which was released in 2018, featured production from the musician and actor himself as well as \nThe Neptunes\n, \nTimbaland\n and more. It debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 with 293,000 album-equivalent units sold in its first week.\nSince then, he's been making the headlines for the drama in his life more than anything else. Most recently, \nBritney Spears told a story of him of adopting a 'blaccent' when they met Ginuwine in New York years ago\n.\n'His band NSYNC was what people called back then \u2018so pimp,'' the pop star wrote. 'They were white boys but they loved Hip Hop. To me, that's what separated them from the \nBackstreet Boys\n, who seemed very consciously to position themselves as a white group. NSYNC hung out with Black artists.'\nShe continued: 'Sometimes, I think they tried too hard to fit in. One day, J and I were in New York going to parts of town I'd never been to before. Walking our way was a guy with a huge blinged-out medallion. He was flanked by two giant security guards. J got all excited and said so loud, \u2018Oh yeah, fo shizz, fo shizz. \nGinuwine\n! What's up, homie?'\nrelated\n news\nMegan Thee Stallion Clears Up Justin Timberlake MTV VMAs 'Fight'\nSeptember 13, 2023\n'After Ginuwine walked away, Felicia [Britney's former assistant] did an impression of J. \u2018Oh yeah, fo shizz, fo shizz. Ginuwine!' J wasn't even embarrassed. He just took it and looked at her like, \u2018Okay, fuck you, Felicia.''\nThe 'Pony' singer later spoke with \nPEOPLE\n about the alleged encounter and couldn't recall such an incident taking place, saying: 'Yeah, yeah, I definitely heard about it. People were calling about that. But I can tell you I don't remember that happening.

            "summary": "Full Name:\n Steve Kim\nWhat office are you seeking?\n \nIllinois Attorney General\nWhat offices, if any, have you previously held?\n Northfield Township Trustee\nCity:\n Deerfield, IL\nOccupation:\n Attorney\nEducation: \nBachelor's Degree - Loyola University of Chicago, Juris Doctorate - Loyola University of Chicago School of Law\nCampaign Website:\n kimforag.com\nWhy should we vote for you for attorney general?\nThe career politicians have failed the citizens of Illinois. Skyrocketing crime and rampant corruption have become a fact of life in Illinois. As a candidate, Kwame Raoul vowed to prosecute corruption and tackle crime, but he has failed. He has ignored the problems in our state. I'm not a career politician, and I don't have the traditional path to be Attorney General. But that unique perspective allows me to look at the office through a new lens, something different than the career politicians who have filled the office year after year. I'm an attorney who has worked around the world, from Cairo, IL to Cairo, Egypt addressing anti- corruption policies, rule of law, and public safety policy. I've adjudicated hundreds of civil rights cases as a member of the Illinois Human Rights Commission. I understand the role that the Attorney General needs to play in addressing crime and combatting corruption, something our current Attorney General does not.\nHow do you view the role of attorney general?\nThe Attorney General should not only be aggressive in protecting taxpayers, but that should also expand to fighting public corruption. In my professional career, I have worked with governments that are rife with corruption, and it creates many of the ongoing, systemic issues we see in Illinois government. As Attorney General, I will fight for taxpayers through consumer protection and in targeting corruption statewide.\nWhat successes has the attorney general's office had?\nI would be hard pressed to commend the current Attorney General for doing anything other than successfully shirking his 2018 campaign promises to tackle corruption. While passing the buck to federal investigators, Kwame Raoul has actively chosen not to pursue corruption for political purposes.\nWhat needs to be improved?\nThe Attorney General's office is falling short of its responsibilities as the state's chief law enforcement office. There are State's Attorneys across the state who are failing to fulfill their responsibilities, not prosecuting criminals, and disregarding the work done by law enforcement in the process. I believe the Attorney General's office needs to work alongside State's Attorneys and ensure that they are prosecuting cases, and taking action to ensure that those who would rather play politics with public safety actually do their jobs.\nWhat are your thoughts on the Public Access Counselor? How can that office be improved?\nBeing open and transparent should be the minimum expectation for a statewide office holder. Our current Attorney General promised to take on corruption when he ran in 2018, and has not said a word about it since, even as major figures who helped get him elected, like Speaker Mike Madigan, have been indicted. This is a transparency and accountability issue I expect to resolve as Attorney General.\nThe attorney general's office was assaulted by a ransomware attack. What can the attorney general do to safeguard Illinois residents from being victimized by ransomware attackers?\nThe Attorney General needs to work closely with State and Federal partners to both prevent and prosecute cybercrimes. First, with other statewide offices like the Secretary of State's office on educational campaigns to teach people how to spot suspicious malware and prevent being victimized. Second, we need to partner with federal authorities in order to protect and get justice for our most vulnerable who are victimized, particularly the elderly.\nAs attorney general, how would you advocate on behalf of women?\nThe Attorney General is expected to work to protect all Illinois residents, and addressing the rising crime in this state does just that, and in particular helps advocate for women. We have State's Attorneys in Illinois that are not pursuing prosecutions, and as Attorney General, I will work to ensure that those prosecutions happen. We need to make sure that repeat offenders, particularly killers and those who assault women, are off the streets.\nAs attorney general, how would you advocate on behalf of older Illinoisans?\nElder fraud is a crime on the rise across the nation and here in Illinois. It is critical for us to put an emphasis on prosecuting elder fraud. As Attorney General, I would bring together a task force to focus on preventing elder fraud in Illinois, sparing our seniors and protecting their personal information and livelihoods, including working with federal authorities to address cybercrimes targeting the elderly.\nDoes Illinois need to overhaul its criminal justice system? If so how? What role does the attorney general play in that debate?\nOne thing is clear: Illinois needs to take action on rising crime immediately. Murders are up across the state, with Cook County recording more than 1000 murders last year alone. That is unacceptable. I've worked in places where people don't feel safe, and the result is the crumbling of societies. Businesses closing, people are afraid to leave their homes, economies crumbling, and more. This is an issue that needs to be addressed right now, and instead Governor Pritzker and Kwame Raoul are playing politics with public safety.\nHow can the attorney general be an advocate for consumers?\nFighting for the consumer is a primary responsibility of the Attorney General, ensuring that Illinoisans are not being taken advantage of by organizations capitalizing on the inflation we're seeing by excessively increasing fees. During my career, I've worked in places without anti-corruption policies and have seen how bad actors take advantage of citizens through price gouging. I will take action to prevent that as Attorney General.\nWhat is the attorney general's role in protecting the environment in Illinois?\nThe Attorney General is responsible for upholding and enforcing the law in Illinois. If there are actors within the state violating environmental or emissions laws, the Attorney General is tasked with representing the people and ensuring those actors comply with necessary regulations.\nWhat will be your top legislative priorities during your term, and why?\nUnlike our current Attorney General, when I promise to take action on corruption, I mean it. As Attorney General, I will call for strengthened anti-corruption legislation that empowers prosecutors to fight for Illinoisans by removing corrupt actors from office. I will also push to strengthen support for law enforcement, calling for the removal of provisions in the SAFE-T act like \u2018free time' for those on house arrest and no-cash bail that are making it more difficult to keep our streets safe.",

            "summary": "Ya gotta love the cheerleaders.\nI think I began to understand this when I was watching the end of a televised marathon \u2013 a grueling race that got me thinking about crossing finish lines.\nSo much personal endurance is involved to reach those final seconds. There must be a continual conversation with yourself.\n'Pace yourself. Breathe. You can do this.'\nThen the finish where pain and pride collapse together into cheering, waving arms, and smiles \u2013 the noise of joy blends with exhilarating exhaustion.\nNow imagine what it would be like to see empty space at the end, nothing but a simple line on the ground to step over.\nNo, it would not be enough. There must be more.\nWatching the marathon I saw you don't have to be a runner to get into the game, to feel your own pulse quicken. Dotted along that 26.2-mile course were strangers handing bottles of water to runners. Everyone there was part of the event. And that is important.\nI was reminded of this by something my wife said after returning from her first-ever Chicago Bears game at Soldier Field. For her it was a bucket-list thing.\nBeing there, part of the crowd with cheering, crazy fans, the food, the panorama, the sunny day with her sister all added up to a great memory.\nShe was part of the spectacle, and that was more important than the game itself, she said. But, of course, all that is part of the game.\nAgain, imagine being a player on the field and looking out at silent, empty seats. It's about winning, but what is victory without applause?\nWe do love a pat on the back, a reminder of why we are in the game. Why it matters to be better, to succeed, to achieve. And why we care if we lose.\nCheering. Encouraging. Pushing. Win or lose, we need cheerleaders. They are part of every sport. But there's more. Because cheerleaders are an important part of every challenge, far beyond sports.\nMarathons are challenging and a noteworthy accomplishment. But they are over in a few hours. Now think about the real marathon, that long, long race we run through life.\nI think back on my years growing up, the hours spent in classrooms, the challenges of jobs and moving and family. I crossed a lot of finish lines.\nMany early benchmarks were set up for me, like a track with hurdles. Get an education. Get a job. Even birthdays are built into the sprint through life.\nBut those finish lines often included celebrations. I had my cheerleaders. I had my applause.\nFinishing high school, getting a driver's license, college and then my first professional job \u2013 they all felt like victories. Because friends and family were there ... cheering.\nThere are all kinds of finish lines, though. How many do we cross alone? Or at least it feels that way.\nI know I am not the only one running the gauntlet of life. We are all in the same race, right? And we need our cheerleaders.\nSo I guess there's good question I should ask myself more often than I do.\n'Who do I know who needs to hear some applause? Right now.'\n\u2022 \nLonny Cain\n, retired managing editor of The Times in Ottawa, also was a reporter for The Herald-News in Joliet in the 1970s. His Paperwork email is lonnyjcain@gmail.com.

They can be found anywhere around the world and are experts at hiding.\n\nYes, their presence can be annoying, but bedbugs are not known to spread diseases. They do cause itching and disturbances in sleep, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While everyone does react differently to their bites, excessive scratching could lead to the risk of a secondary skin infection, and some people may even be allergic to bedbugs.\n\nAccording to Orkin, you can identify bedbugs in your home by spotting clusters of dark brown or black excrement on surfaces, along with a subtle, sweet, musty odor.\n\nBedbugs thrive in small cracks near sleeping areas, including your bed and furniture. They also enjoy gaps behind outlets, floor molding, window and door molding, and where carpet edges meet the wall.",

Social media platforms often serve as a repository of personal information. Spouses going through a divorce may use posts, messages, photos, or videos as evidence of misconduct, such as infidelity, excessive spending, or substance abuse. Such evidence can influence property division, spousal support, and child custody decisions. Posting grievances or disparaging comments about a spouse on social media can escalate conflicts and make negotiations more challenging. Negative online interactions can also affect the emotional well-being of both parties and their children. Technology can be used to hide assets or financial transactions. Spouses may attempt to conceal income or assets through online banking or cryptocurrency transactions, making it more difficult to achieve an equitable division of property. One spouse may use technology to invade the other's privacy, such as hacking into their email or social media accounts, tracking their online activities, or recording private conversations. These actions can lead to legal consequences and impact the divorce process. Social media posts can be used to scrutinize a parent's behavior and lifestyle. Sharing inappropriate content or demonstrating questionable parenting practices online may impact child custody determinations. Constant exposure to negative or hostile online interactions can contribute to emotional distress, impacting a spouse's mental health and ability to negotiate effectively. Technology can facilitate stalking or harassment by one spouse against the other. Cyberbullying or online harassment can lead to legal actions or restraining orders or impact child custody arrangements. Engaging in new relationships through online dating apps or websites during divorce proceedings can complicate matters, potentially affecting spousal support, child custody, and the emotional well-being of the parties involved. Courts may admit social media posts, messages, or emails as evidence in divorce cases. Parties should exercise caution when communicating online, as their words and actions may be used against them in court. \n \"It's crucial to understand that online actions can have real-world consequences in divorce cases, and prudence is essential when navigating this complex intersection of technology and family law,\" says Attorney \nMarc Wolfe\n.\nAbout Wolfe & Stec Law Firm\n \n Marc Wolfe is a seasoned criminal defense and \nfamily law attorney\n based in Chicago, Illinois, boasting over three decades of experience.

Some states might have Class A, B, C felonies, while others have Level 1, 2, 3 felonies. The specific offenses that fall into each class can also vary widely from state to state. In Illinois, felony crimes are classified into several categories based on their severity: \n \nClass X felonies\n are the most serious offenses in Illinois. Convictions for Class X felonies can result in imprisonment for a term of not less than 6 years and up to 30 years. \nExamples of Class X felonies\n include aggravated sexual assault and certain drug offenses.\n \n \nClass 1 felonies\n are punishable by 4 to 15 years in prison. Examples of Class 1 felonies include certain drug offenses and certain types of sexual assault.\n \n \nClass 2 felonies\n are punishable by 3 to 7 years in prison. Examples include certain types of robbery and burglary.\n \n \nClass 3 felonies\n are punishable by 2 to 5 years in prison. Examples include aggravated battery and some drug offenses.\n \n \nClass 4 felonies\n are punishable by 1 to 3 years in prison. Examples include certain types of theft and forgery.\n Certain offenses, while normally classified as misdemeanors, can be enhanced to Class 4 felonies if certain aggravating factors are present. The penalties for Class A misdemeanors typically include up to 1 year in county jail, but when enhanced to Class 4 felonies, the punishment becomes 1 to 3 years in prison. If you or someone you know is facing criminal charges, it's advisable to consult with a legal professional to get the most accurate and up-to-date information about the potential consequences. \n \"Because felony charges carry such serious penalties, you must look for an attorney who has successfully handled felony cases before,\" says \nAttorney Marc Wolfe\n.\nAbout Wolfe and Stec Law Firm\n \n Marc Wolfe has been representing clients in criminal matters in Chicago and the entire State of Illinois for over 30 years.

            "summary": "Parkinson disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer disease.\n1\n Approximately 1 million people in the US are diagnosed with PD and this number is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030, per the Parkinson's Foundation Parkinson's Prevalence Project.\n1\nCarbidopa/levodopa is considered the gold standard for the management of PD motor symptoms. A retrospective cohort study spanning 5 years in 11,280 patients revealed that carbidopa/levodopa was the most prescribed first-line treatment in 70% of the population.\n2\n Since its approval in 1970, multiple formulations have become available. This has expanded options for patients, but also complicated pharmacologic management for patients, caregivers, and their providers. Understanding differences in the various levodopa formulations and assisting with medication therapy management is a crucial role for pharmacists.\nImage credit: LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS | stock.adobe.com\nCarbidopa/Levodopa Immediate Release and Orally Disintegrating Tablets\nCarbidopa/levodopa immediate release (IR) tablets are commonly the first levodopa formulation prescribed to patients with PD. The IR formulation has a peak onset of 30 minutes to 1 hour with a half-life of 1.5 to 2 hours.\n3\n There is also an orally disintegrating tablet (ODT) formulation for patients with difficulty swallowing pills.\n4\n The ODT has a peak onset of 30 minutes and does not require water for administration. However, as PD progresses, the window of levodopa's effectiveness is significantly reduced, resulting in more 'off' time and subsequent requirement of increased doses and/or frequency.\n5\n Dyskinesia and motor 'on/off' fluctuations develop in about 50% of PD patients within 5 years of treatment.\nFor those new to therapy, pharmacists should counsel patients to space doses evenly throughout waking hours. Spacing doses throughout the awake hours helps to optimize observed benefits during activities of daily living. Additionally, patients should be advised to avoid taking doses with high fat, high caloric meals because this can delay gastrointestinal absorption up to 2 hours.\n3,4\nCarbidopa/Levodopa Controlled Release Tablets\nCarbidopa/levodopa controlled release (CR) tablets provide a sustained release formulation. It has a bioavailability of 70% to 75% relative to that of IR formulations, with a time to peak of 1.5 to 2 hours.\n5,7\n Because the time to reach maximal concentration is delayed, some patients may concomitantly take an IR formulation with the first morning dose. The CR tablets utilize a polymeric based drug delivery system that is designed to release carbidopa/levodopa over 4 to 6 hours allowing for 3 times-per-day dosing. However, CR is less systemically bioavailable than IR formulations and may require higher daily doses in some patients to achieve the same level of symptomatic relief. As such, levodopa doses > 800 mg may be divided every 4 to 8 hours during the waking hours. In clinical trials, the CR formulation provided the same therapeutic benefit as the IR formulation; however, with less frequent dosing when compared to IR. Pharmacists should advise patients not to crush, chew, or cut the CR formulation as this may result in carbidopa/levodopa being released too fast.\nCarbidopa/Levodopa Extended-Release Capsules\nCarbidopa/levodopa extended release (ER) formulations have a bioavailability of 70% relative to that of IR formulations with an initial peak at 1 hour.\n8\n The ER formulation allows for an extended duration of action due to its unique formulation of time release beads. Each capsule consists of one-third of IR carbidopa/levodopa beads, which allows it to start working immediately, while the other two-thirds consists of ER carbidopa/levodopa beads, which, when coupled with the IR beads, allows it to maintain serum levels for up to 5 hours. In addition to IR/ER beads, each capsule also contains an excipient containing tartaric acid. This is intended to provide an acidic environment to enhance levodopa absorption.6Because of its duration of action, ER formulations can be initiated at 3 times a day and titrated to a maximum of 5 times a day.\n8\nER formulations are not interchangeable with other carbidopa/levodopa formulations due to variations in dosages and pharmacokinetics. The prescribing information should be consulted when converting to the ER product. For patients who have difficulty swallowing, the capsule may be opened, and the contents of both halves sprinkled into applesauce and consumed immediately.\nCarbidopa/Levodopa Continuous Enteral Solution\nEnteral carbidopa/levodopa bypasses the stomach to allow for continuous administration over 16 hours directly into the small intestine.\n9\n It is administered via a specialty pump into the jejunum through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG-J). For temporary administration prior to PEG-J tube placement, treatment may be initiated via a naso-jejunal tube. Continuous infusion provides steady pharmacokinetics, increased efficacy, and fewer oral doses throughout the day. Prior to initiating enteral therapy, all carbidopa/levodopa forms should be converted to the IR formulation to facilitate conversion. Conversely, if a patient receiving enteral carbidopa/levodopa is admitted to the hospital and does not have access to it for inpatient use, a neurologist should be consulted to temporarily switch to an IR formulation. Communication with the outpatient neurologist prior to discharge is also warranted to facilitate transition of care.\nLevodopa Inhalation Powder\nLevodopa inhalation powder provides on-demand inhaled levodopa that starts to work as early as 10 minutes after taking.\n10\n It is intended to reduce the duration of 'off' periods in advanced disease. Because it is a rescue therapy, it should not be used as primary therapy. Levodopa powder for inhalation is supplied in capsules that are inhaled with a product-specific inhaler. Each dose is comprised of 2 capsules, with each capsule loaded into the device and inhaled individually. However, since the inhalation route is intended for 'off' periods, patients with severe symptoms may have trouble setting up the inhaler. As such, caregivers should also be instructed on proper use of the inhaler device.\nPharmacist's Role\nErrors related to incorrect levodopa formulations are amongst the top errors observed in patients with PD admitted to the hospital.\n11\n With the variety of formulations, each with their own unique pharmacokinetic properties, appropriate selection is vital. Other safety concerns include delays in medication reconciliation and administration. Pharmacists should ensure timely reconciliation along with documentation of the patient's dosing schedule to avoid standardized administration times and omission errors. ISMP recommends setting a goal of obtaining a medication history within 2 hours of admission.\nIn patients that are alert and oriented, discussion with the medical team regarding self-administration may be an option to minimize delays. Although this is not routinely suggested, it may be a solution when frequent (every <4 hours) doses are needed.\nAdditionally, delays in obtaining nonformulary medications should be minimized. Consultation with the patient's neurologist may be of benefit if a specific formulation cannot be provided while hospitalized. Ensuring abrupt discontinuation of PD medications is essential to avoid significant adverse events.\nReferences\n1. Statistics. Parkinson's Foundation.

Train\u0092s climb to the top began in 1994, as the original 5-member band tenaciously built a loyal hometown following, leading up to their debut self-titled album released by Columbia in 1998. The tumbling wordplay of \u0093Meet Virginia\u0094 gave them their first unlikely radio hit, and 2001\u0092s Drops of Jupiter broke them to multi-platinum status thanks to the double-GRAMMY-winning title song that spent 10 months in the Top 40, has been certified RIAA 7x platinum, and earned the 2001 GRAMMY Award for Best Rock Song. The group won another GRAMMY in 2011 for their global hit \u0093Hey, Soul Sister\u0094 from their multi-platinum album Save Me, San Francisco(2009), which was the No.1 best-selling smash and most downloaded single of 2010, achieved RIAA Diamond status in 2021 and now 11x platinum, and in 2022 surpassed one billion streams on Spotify. Train has sold more than 10 million albums and 30 million tracks worldwide, with multiple platinum/gold citations, including three GRAMMY Awards, two Billboard Music Awards, and dozens of other honors. They\u0092ve had 24 Top 10 songs across the Billboard charts and six Top 10 albums on the Billboard 200 chart including Drops of Jupiter (2001), My Private Nation (2003), California 37(2012), Bulletproof Picasso(2014), For Me, It\u0092s You (2016), and a girl a bottle a boat (2017). Train released their critically acclaimed 11th studio album, AM Gold, in May 2022 and most recently released a new song \u0093I Know\u0094 ft. Tenille Townes and Bryce Vine, which marked their 27th career entry on Billboard\u0092s Adult Pop Airplay chart.\n\nTrain frontman, Pat Monahan, partakes in other ventures outside of music, including his award-winning wine portfolio, Save Me, San Francisco Wine Co, which was created in 2011 and has sold over 10 million bottles and won over 100 medals. Proceeds from his wine business support Family House, a San Francisco charity that supports families of children with cancer and other life-threatening illnesses. Monahan has appeared on television and in film with credits that include the 2021 Hallmark Channel original movie, Christmas in Tahoe, inspired by Train\u0092s album of the same name, which he executive produced and starred, Dr. Ken, 90210, CBS\u0092s Hawaii Five-0 and Magnum P.I., The Voice, American Idol, and The Bachelor.\n\nConnect with Train:\n\nWebsite | Instagram | Facebook | X | TikTok\n\nAbout REO Speedwagon\n\nFormed in 1967, signed in 1971, and fronted by iconic vocalist Kevin Cronin since 1972, REO Speedwagon\u0092s unrelenting drive, as well as non-stop touring and recording jump-started the burgeoning rock movement in the Midwest.

            "summary": "was a quiet man who enjoyed being with his children, playing virtual reality games with his closest friends and reveling in the company of his wife.\n\nSpace, 46, of Kenosha, was shot and killed on Tuesday in the parking lot outside a popular Pleasant Prairie shopping center in the 10300 block of 77th Street. On Thursday afternoon, Pleasant Prairie police announced they had arrested two suspects a day earlier in connection with the deadly shooting. The suspects have yet to be identified or charged, said law enforcement officials.\n\nMany of Space's friends and family on social media who had learned of his death remembered him for his strength, kindness and character. Kristina Toto, who spoke about her close friend called him 'a very quiet, soft-spoken, gentle, open-hearted kind man.'\n\n'He walked with God and he believed that after he got married and had children, those were his best friends and the only people who he really needed to be looking for daily,' Toto said Thursday night in an interview. He and his wife Dora were inseparable.\n\n'Wherever you'd seen one, you saw the other,' she said. 'They do everything together.'\n\nWhen he'd come from work each night he'd spend time with his kids and he could often be seen spending time with his 'homies' playing video games. But the family would also participate in 'paint nights' and go on trips together.\n\nSpace, his wife and their four children, who are now teenagers and adults, are 'extremely close-knit,' she said.\n\n'The person who did this \u2026 they don't know what they did,' she said of her friend's fatal shooting. 'Anton isn't the type of person who has an enemy at all.'\n\n'Loved helping people'\n\nSpace took care of mentally disabled individuals. He loved helping people learn about everything from geography to video games. When he wasn't playing virtual reality games, like \"Cookout\" and \"After the Fall,\" as a proud native of Chicago's South Side, he enjoyed rooting for the White Sox and he loved the Bears and the Bulls.\n\nToto said she was at a bingo activity on Tuesday afternoon when she noticed Dora Space had called her multiple times.\n\n'I thought she was trying to come find out where the bingo was,' she said. When she learned Anton Space had been shot and killed, she ran out of the room and went to their home to comfort his wife and children.\n\n'It was a very hard and emotional night for everybody,' she said. 'It's absolutely devastating. This person don't know what they took. He's not a thug. He's not somebody out there causing problems. He doesn't have any enemies. It's just very inexplicable.'\n\nToto, who first met Space when their daughters were younger and attended Wilson Elementary, said he raised his children to be strong and independent.\n\n'He kept his kids away from gangs,' she said. 'He gave them better chances. That's all he cared about was making sure his family got a better chance.'\n\nPolice have yet to say why suspects targeted him or what happened in the moments that led up to the fatal shooting.\n\n'Nobody really knows exactly what he was doing there and what happened,' she said. 'I know nothing about that part except that he was there and now he's not here. The officers are very quiet with everything.'\n\nAccording to law enforcement radio traffic reports in Mount Pleasant, police mid-afternoon on Wednesday had stopped two people, a man and a woman, and were conducting a 'high risk' stop, allegedly related to the incident in Pleasant Prairie. Authorities were reported to have set up 'spikes' to stop the vehicle prior to the arrest that occurred at Highway 31 near Larchmont Drive. While Pleasant Prairie police announced that suspects had been arrested in connection with the homicide, they disclosed neither their identities nor the location of the arrest.\n\n`Everything was taken away'\n\nDora Space appeared somewhat relieved after Toto told her of the arrests on Thursday; however, she seemed \"dead inside,' she said.\n\nShe told Toto she had always imagined the two of them growing old together, having their grandchildren with them and the trips they would take.\n\nNow, 'everything was taken away,' Toto said.\n\n'They literally killed her heart, her best friend,' she said. 'He filled a void for her that nobody on the planet could.'\n\nCounties with the most gun deaths Counties With the Most Gun Deaths The rates of gun related homicides _ suicides are rising 1 More than 75_ of homicides _ 50_ of suicides involve a gun 1 Mississippi _ Louisiana have the highest rates of gun related deaths 1 Small _ midsize counties with the highest rates of gun deaths 1 15.

It finds Bayside's darkly catchy emo-punk sounding as energized as it did two decades ago, and that chorus is a real singalong. 'I think \u2018Castaway' is one of the most exciting songs that we've written in 24 years,' says vocalist Anthony Raneri. 'We really wanted to keep the listener on their toes and on the edge of their seat. We hope that between the fast pace, odd timings, and metaphors that as soon as it's over, you need to listen again.'

They made it with hometown engineer Jay Zubricky (Every Time I Die, Terror, etc), and it finds the band staying true to their classic hardcore influences without limiting themselves, as they explain:\n\n\nWe've always had the intention of approaching hardcore with a traditional base\u2014taking our influence from bands like The Rival Mob, Suicidal Tendencies, Gorilla Biscuits, and so many others\u2014but adding textures and sounds that you might hear from bands like Sonic Youth, My Bloody Valentine, The Cure, Swans, etc.\n\n\nThis release is our most confident work yet, and we feel stronger in what we're doing with every facet of the band. We want the riffs and vocals to hit and impact anyone who listens\u2014whether you're discussing the record or a live setting\u2014while adding reverb, flange, and delay in sections to fulfill the \u2018SPACED' sound. We're continually shaping what that means for us, and look forward to keep developing our sound in the hardcore space.\n\n\nThe first taste of \nThis Is All We Get\n is 'Landslide,' which lives up to that album description\u2013it's a hardcore ripper with just the right amount of genre-bending atmosphere and a hook that's damn near impossible not to shout along to. It comes with an Adam Kellerman-directed music video that brings retro workout videos and mosh pits together.

When I get my mind right, I am confronted with it several times a day. //\n\n\nWhile I was writing this album I fired my manager of many years, as at last my desire to develop my artistic agency outpaced the fear that I might be no good at calling the shots in my own life // While I was recording this album I was dropped by Epitaph Records // Creating a record 'independently' has taught me that I am not at all alone, and this record would not exist without many invaluable and unexpected allies // I hope you will listen and know that it is a labor of love -ro\n\n\n\n\n\nThey've shared a new single, the pop punk-tinged indie rock track 'All My Exes Live in Vortexes,' and you can watch the video below.\n\n\nRosie has also announced a US tour, beginning in San Francisco on April 23 and wrapping up in Phoenix on May 17.

            "summary": "Shannon & The Clams have announced a new album, The Moon Is In The Wrong Place, which will be out May 10 via Easy Eye Sound. The Black Keys\u2018 Dan Auerbach, who worked on The Clams' last two LPs and Shannon Shaw's underrated 2019 solo debut (and runs Easy Eye Sound), produced the album.\n\nThe album was inspired by tragedy: in 2022, Shannon Shaw's fiance, Joe Haener, was killed in an auto accident just weeks before their wedding. 'We all felt the urgency of making something that reckoned with this meteor that smashed into our planet,' keyboardist Will Sprott says. 'This is the most focused record we've ever done, as far as everything coming from a singular traumatic event.'\n\nSad as the circumstances are surrounding it, the resulting album looks to be the most ambitious one they've ever made, leaving the garage for widescreen high-fi production. You can get a taste with The Moon is in the Wrong Place\u2018s title track, which almost sounds like a Bond theme. Watch the video, directed by Bobbi Rich, below.\n\nShannon & The Clams have also anounced tour dates, which have them out this spring and fall. The NYC stop is at Warsaw on May 30 and you can get tickets early for that show with the BrooklynVegan presale that run from Monday, January 29 at 10 AM through Tuesday, January 30 at 10 PM.

Tickets are on sale now.\n\n\nErick plays a hometown Brooklyn show on \nApril 3 at Elsewhere Hall\n. All dates are listed below.\n\n\nErick has also just shared the fourth single from the album, 'Instincts' (ft. \nWestside Boogie\n), following 'Parkour' (ft. \nJames Blake\n), 'Ezekiel's Wheel' (ft. \nGeorge Clinton\n), 'Shook Up' (ft. \nJoey Bada$$ & FARR\n), and 'Ambrosia' (ft. \nChannel Tres\n). Still to come are songs with \nBaby Rose, Kimbra, Lalah Hathaway\n, and more, and three other songs produced by James Blake.\n\n\nAbout 'Instincts,' Erick says, '\u2018Instincts' speaks on living everyday like it could be your last\u2014 The decisions you make today truly affect tomorrow's outcome. Balancing your guttural instincts versus being pressured into a decision is something I've always had to juggle my entire life until I realized what feels right to me will always be the right choice. Growing up in the hood meant that you had to follow these innate feelings everyday to survive, and I'm grateful to have learned these lessons early on. WESTSIDE BOOGIE is one of my favorite lyricists and I knew he would deliver the perfect verse based on what I learned from listening to his story in his music.'\n\n\nWestside Boogie adds, 'Teaming up with Erick for \u2018Instincts' was dope. The track captures that struggle between survival and staying true to yourself. Erick's vision resonated w me, and I wanted to echo that sentiment. It's all about choices that match who you are, despite external pressures. Erick set the perfect tone for this song. Collaborating was an honor, diving into our shared grasp of life's decisions and their impacts.'\n\n\nCheck out all five currently-released singles from the album below.\n \n\n\nErick the Architect \u2014 2024 Tour Dates\n\nMarch 25 \u2013 Austin, TX \u2013 Come and Take it Live\nMarch 26 \u2013 Dallas, TX \u2013 HOB \u2013 Cambridge Room\nMarch 27 \u2013 Houston, TX \u2013 HOB \u2013 Bronze Peacock\nMarch 29 \u2013 Orlando, FL \u2013 The Social\nMarch 30 \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 The Masquerade (Hell)\nApril 01 \u2013 Washington DC \u2013 Union Stage\nApril 02 \u2013 Boston, MA \u2013 Brighton Music Hall\nApril 03 \u2013 Brooklyn, NY \u2013 Elsewhere (The Hall)\nApril 04 \u2013 Philadelphia, PA \u2013 The Foundry @ The Fillmore\nApril 06 \u2013 Burlington, VT \u2013 Higher Ground (Showcase Lounge)\nApril 08 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 The Velvet Underground\nApril 10 \u2013 Columbus, OH \u2013 Ace of Cups\nApril 11 \u2013 Detroit, MI \u2013 El Club\nApril 12 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Reggie's\nApril 16 \u2013 Vancouver, BC -Fortune Sound Club\nApril 17 \u2013 Seattle, WA \u2013 Neumos\nApril 18 \u2013 Portland, OR \u2013 Hawthorne\nApril 20 \u2013 Morrison, CO \u2013 Red Rocks Amphitheatre\nApril 22 \u2013 Salt Lake City, UT \u2013 The Complex\nApril 24 \u2013 Albuquerque, NM \u2013 Launchpad\nApril 25 \u2013 Mesa, AZ \u2013 The Nile\nApril 26 \u2013 Santa Ana, CA \u2013 Constellation Room\nMay 01 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 The Roxy\nMay 03 \u2013 San Francisco, CA \u2013 Brick & Mortar\nMay 04 \u2013 Santa Cruz, CA \u2013 The Catalyst (The Atrium)\nMay 08 \u2013 Manchester, UK \u2013 Gorilla\nMay 09 \u2013 London, UK \u2013 Scala\nMay 11 \u2013 Cologne, Germany \u2013 CBE\nMay 13 \u2013 Brussels, Belgium \u2013 Orangerie @ Botanique\nMay 14 \u2013 Amsterdam, Netherlands \u2013 Bitterzoet\nMay 16 \u2013 Paris, France \u2013 Badaboum\nMay 17 \u2013 Zurich, Switzerland \u2013 Plaza\nMay 18 \u2013 Vienna, Austria \u2013 Flex\nMay 20 \u2013 Warsaw, Poland \u2013 Hybrydy\nMay 21 \u2013 Berlin, Germany \u2013 Frannz Club\nMay 22 \u2013 Copenhagen, Denmark \u2013 VEGA Small Hall\nMay 23 \u2013 Stockholm, Sweden \u2013 Nalen Klubb\n\nMay 25 \u2013 Oslo, Norway \u2013 Parkteatret\n\n\n\n\nTracklist\n\nI Am Still\n2-3 Zone (prod.

The band previously did a set at the venue attached to the store's Williamsburg location \nin 2016\n, but the new Rockefeller Center location doesn't have the venue so they played right in the store. Tickets, which were available with a signed copy of \nSaviors\n, sold out immediately, but Green Day hid a few wristbands throughout the city, which they teased the locations of on social media.\n\n\nThe packed house got a 12-song set that included \nSaviors\n material and a few older songs (including four from \nDookie\n and one from \nAmerican Idiot\n, the albums they'll be \nplaying in full on their upcoming stadium tour\n). See the setlist, pictures by \nToby Tenenbaum\n, and attendee-taken video below.\n\n\nAfter Rough Trade, Green Day made their way to Avenue A club Berlin later in the evening for a private event; you can see a video of Billie Joe Armstrong speaking there below.\n\n\nGreen Day also did a \nsurprise set on the subway\n on Wednesday. They'll be back in NYC on their stadium tour for a much larger show at \nCiti Field on August 5\n with \nThe Smashing Pumpkins, Rancid\n, and \nThe Linda Lindas\n.

LTW is nourished by Co-Hosts in each city: Chicago, Seattle, Boston, Atlanta, Phoenix, Philadelphia, Greater NY, Cincinnati, Kentucky, Miami, Minneapolis, Houston, Milwaukee, and Columbus. Everything LTW does by its female owners is to collaboratively combine strength, counsel, business learnings, generate revenue, and visibility for each other's businesses. LTW is open to all women owners in food and drink to build strength in numbers and lift each other to scale.

            "summary": "Denver, CO / Chicago, IL, Jan. 23, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- An important addition to the national access to justice landscape, the Above the Line Network (ATLN) has launched today to tackle the daunting challenges that middle-class Americans face when seeking legal help that doesn't break the bank. While most organized access to justice efforts rightly focus on low-income and poor people who are especially vulnerable, we can never achieve our nation's ideal of equal justice for all when middle-class people\u2014who make up more than 50% of the nation's population\u2014 and small businesses struggle to find quality, affordable legal services. They are 'above the line' of income eligibility for the free legal aid reserved for the poorest Americans, but they also struggle to find quality and affordable legal services in the current legal market.\n\nWith a specific focus on the legal needs of the vastly overlooked middle class, ATLN is a new, organized network of individuals and organizations across the country and in Canada that are committed to improving access for the middle-market\u2014a collaborative and supportive community where ideas, resources, and best practices can be shared, further developed, and scaled to reach more people who need affordable legal services.\n\n'With the majority of Americans being left behind, a more concerted national effort is needed to address this distinct access gap, and ATLN aims to do just that,' said Jessica Bednarz, IAALS Director of Legal Services and the Profession. 'To do so, we don't necessarily need to reinvent the wheel. Most of the pieces are there, and what we're doing is bringing them together, thoughtfully and carefully, and ensuring that it rolls in the right direction\u2014faster, more effectively, and finally getting the middle class where they need to go.'\n\nATLN intends to pull the many pieces together as a full ecosystem of middle-class legal providers and models for serving these clients. While there are some promising programs and models tackling this problem around the United States, Canada, and beyond, there is not a coordinated effort among them. ATLN will change that, uniting these existing efforts together\u2014from incubators, socially conscious private law firms, nonprofit law firms, legal aid programs, and other organizations\u2014to help them grow, thrive, and replicate, and foster advocacy for the middle class in the larger access to justice circles.\n\n'ATLN will help ensure that the voice of middle-class Americans is heard and represented in access-to-justice advocacy and funding efforts by engaging funders, the judiciary, and the bar on the extent of the gap in legal services and the need for more resources dedicated to serving middle-class people,' said Roya Samarghandi, Associate Director of Advocacy, Innovation & Training at the CBF.\n\nBy collaborating and expanding on successful middle-class-focused legal services, and by building support for larger policy and systemic changes, ATLN stands to dramatically increase access to justice for the middle class\u2014and ultimately, people of all income levels.\n\nIAALS, the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System at the University of Denver, and The Chicago Bar Foundation (CBF) are excited to partner on this critically urgent project. The project advances the CBF's work in helping legal consumers in the middle class connect with affordable and accessible quality legal services\u2014including through its legal incubator program, the Justice Entrepreneurs Project\u2014and the work of IAALS in helping the legal profession evolve to put client and consumer needs first and enable people of all socioeconomic backgrounds to find the legal help they need. ATLN is led by knowledgeable, experienced leaders and innovators from across the United States, Canada, and beyond who are dedicated to transforming the delivery of legal services to the underserved middle class.\n\nATLN is offering two upcoming webinars which will delve further into the problem, challenges, and promising solutions.\n\n'Transforming the Delivery of Legal Services: Unveiling the Above the Line Network'\n\nFebruary 27, 2024, 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. MT\n\nMore information and free registration\n\nFebruary 27, 2024, 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. MT More information and free registration 'Tackling Root Causes & Overcoming the Middle-Class Access to Justice Problem'\n\nMarch 7, 2024, 11:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. MT\n\nMore information and free registration\n\nIndividuals and organizations who are interested in joining the Above the Line Network can learn more about the membership criteria and apply to join ATLN on the project page.\n\nMore information and quick links:\n\nAttachment\n\nKelsey Montague IAALS, the Institute for the Advancement of the American Legal System 303-888-0393 kelsey.montague@du.edu Emme Veenbaas The Chicago Bar Foundation 312-554-1247 eveenbaas@chicagobarfoundation.org",

(LP), a leading worldwide provider of transportation, logistics, and supply chain solutions, has secured Customs bonding from the U.S. Customs & Border Protection (CBP) at its new warehouse located south of Cleveland, OH. The 165 thousand square foot warehouse located in Strongsville, OH , was officially opened late last year. Additional Customs bonds are in progress for Logistics Plus warehouses in Phoenix, AZ, Chicago, IL, Memphis, TN, and Dallas, TX.Customs bonded warehouses are a type of warehouse where goods can be stored and processed before paying taxes. The primary users of bonded warehouses are importers and exporters who need to store goods temporarily before shipping them to their final destination.Benefits of using a Customs bonded warehouse include:\u2022 Avoiding expensive terminal fees associated with withhold release orders (WRO) holds for shipments reviewed for the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA).\u2022 Allows importers to delay paying duties on their imported goods.\u2022 If the goods are destroyed under CBP supervision, no duty is payable.\u2022 Goods stored in a bonded warehouse are exempt from customs inspections, saving the importer time and money.\u2022 Offers increased security for goods because Customs officials monitor them.\u2022 Under CBP supervision, goods can be manipulated by cleaning, sorting, repacking, or otherwise changing their condition by processes that do not amount to manufacturing.\u2022 Goods may be exported without the payment of duty, or they may be withdrawn for consumption upon payment of duty at the rate applicable to the goods in their manipulated condition at the time of withdrawal.\u2022 Goods may remain in the bonded warehouse for up to five years from the date of importation, allowing the importer additional time to handle the paperwork and legal formalities.'Many bonded warehouses across the U.S. are private, meaning they are dedicated to only one importer,' said Gretchen Blough, Customs Brokerage Manager for Logistics Plus. 'This means that bonded warehouse space is very scarce and at a premium when it can be found. We decided to create our own bonded warehouse space with our existing public warehouses, so our customers have better options than what is currently available in the warehousing market.'About Logistics Plus, Inc.Logistics Plus, Inc.
