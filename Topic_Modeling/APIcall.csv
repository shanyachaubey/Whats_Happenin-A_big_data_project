Mrs. Longmont says she is 'not a pageant girl',Dana Cadey,2024-01-27,Boulder, CO,https://news.yahoo.com/mrs-longmont-says-she-not-154000745.html,Jan. 27—Michelle Deines is, in her own words, not a pageant girl. That's not stopping her from returning to the Mrs. Colorado contest for her second year in a row, representing her home city of…,Jan. 27—Michelle Deines is, in her own words, not a pageant girl.
That's not stopping her from returning to the Mrs. Colorado contest for her second year in a row, representing her home city of Longmont.
"I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I am incredibly introverted," said Deines, Mrs. Longmont 2024. "But I have this passion to want to help people, and I'm just trying to live out what I'm being called to do right now."
Deines competed in last year's Mrs. Colorado pageant alongside her mom, Dianne Haskell, who was Mrs. Firestone. Deines placed in the competition's social media category for her work promoting the pageant, while Haskell won the award for being the longest married contestant.
Haskell and Deines are side-by-side again this year as Mrs. Firestone and Mrs. Longmont, respectively. The pageant might be a competition — whoever wins Mrs. Colorado in April advances to the Mrs. America contest later this year — but Deines said there's no competitiveness between her and her mom.
"All of the other women just loved that Mom and I did it together, and that we were so helpful to everybody else," Deines said. "I'm going to really treasure that forever, having this experience with her doing something that is really unique."
That lack of competitiveness extends to the rest of the contestants, as well, which Deines likened to a sisterhood.
"We're just women who are trying to make a difference in our community in a positive way," she said. "They all have gifts and talents that they're bringing to the table."
In addition to homeschooling her two kids, Deines works during the winter as a supervisor at the Longmont Ice Pavilion in Roosevelt Park. She's also an officer for her church and helps with ballot processing for Boulder County during election seasons.
Deines' campaign slogan is "Serving Others to Strengthen Communities with Purpose, Kindness and Faith."
"Everything that I do has a purpose," Deines said, referencing her detail-oriented nature. "(And) we need more kindness in this world, to be loving and accepting of each other."
Last year, Deines started a podcast through Longmont Public Media that highlights a different local nonprofit or service organization every episode. "Serving Locally, with Michelle" has already covered several groups, including the Veterans Community Project of Longmont, St. Vrain State Park and the Longmont Humane Society.
Keeping things local is a central feature of Deines' campaign. She buys her pageant gowns from thrift stores in town, her hairdresser lives in Longmont, and her photoshoot for last year's contest took place in the heart of downtown along Main Street.
"I'm trying to build up Longmont as much as I can in whatever I'm doing," Deines said. "I want to have sponsors that are local so I can help them out."
While winning the competition would send Deines to Las Vegas for the Mrs. America pageant, first place isn't something she necessarily has her eyes on. If she wins, she can't enter Mrs. Colorado in the future. And for Deines, her favorite part of being Mrs. Longmont is the opportunity to show others what makes the city special.
"I want the spotlight so I can shine it and redirect it on other things in the community," Deines said.
Mrs. Colorado will be held on April 6 at the Denver Performing Arts Complex, 1400 Curtis St. in Denver.

Colorado man dies while skydiving after parachutes fail to deploy,Mirna Alsharif,2024-01-29,Boulder, CO,https://news.yahoo.com/colorado-man-dies-while-skydiving-223305230.html,A Colorado man died while skydiving after his parachutes failed to deploy Saturday, according to authorities.,A Colorado man died while skydiving after his parachutes failed to deploy Saturday, according to authorities.
Longmont Public Safety responded to the area south of Vance Brand Airport at around 3:27 p.m., according to a news release.
The victim, a 36-year-old man, was a participant with the Mile-Hi Skydiving Center in Longmont and wearing a wing suit at the time of his death, authorities said.
"Early information indicated that it appeared his primary and/or reserve chute were not deployed before striking the ground," said Robin Ericson, Longmont Public Safety spokesperson.
The man has not been identified pending release from the coroner's office. The Boulder County Coroner's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.
The Federal Aviation Authority is aware of the incident and is investigating "the packing of the main and reserve parachutes, and the rules of flight for the pilot and aircraft," but will not determine cause, a spokesperson said.

Colorado skydiver falls to his death in freak accident,Michael Dorgan,2024-01-30,Boulder, CO,https://news.yahoo.com/colorado-skydiver-falls-death-freak-155611838.html,A wingsuited man fell to his death in a skydiving incident in Colorado on Saturday after both his primary and reserve parachutes failed to deploy.,A man wearing a wingsuit fell to his death in a skydiving incident in Colorado on Saturday after both his primary and reserve parachutes failed to deploy.
Gregory Coates, 36, was skydiving near Vance Brand Airport in Longmont just before 3:30 p.m. when tragedy struck, according to the Boulder County Coroner's Office. The airport is about 40 miles north of Denver and the incident took place in the area of Nelson Road and Grandview Meadows Drive in Longmont.
Coates, who was from a mountain community near the Denver Metro area, was wearing a wingsuit and was jumping with the Mile-Hi Skydiving Center, which is based at the airport, the Longmont Police Department said. A wingsuit skydiver wears a specialized webbed-sleeved jumpsuit with membranes between the arms, body and legs, which allows a diver to glide flight in the air.

According to several reports, neither Coates' primary nor his reserve chute opened. It is not known what level of experience he had at skydiving or what type of aircraft he jumped out of.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was notified of the incident, but they did not respond to the scene, according to Fox 17.

The FAA told Fox  Digital it investigates the packing of the main and reserve parachutes and the rules of flight for the pilot and aircraft. The FAA does not determine the cause of skydiving incidents, a spokesperson said.
Fox  Digital requested comment from Mile-Hi Skydiving Center but did not immediately receive a response.

Saturday's deadly incident is not the first linked to Mile-Hi Skydiving Center.
In 2018, a 23-year-old man died while jumping with the company, according to Fox 17, which reports that the city has raised concerns about the company's safety record in the past.
In 2008, a skydiving instructor and his student died after a fall while doing a tandem jump over the airport.
More recently, a 26-year-old Boulder man was killed in a solo jump with the company in 2021, marking the fifth fatality connected to Mile-Hi Skydiving since 2018, according to CBS.
The FAA says there are around 30 to 40 fatalities among skydivers each year, calling it an "extraordinarily high rate."
The United States Parachute Association, a private sports organization, says about 4 million skydives were made in the U.S. last year. Of those, more than 500,000 were first-timers.

Erie's Addie Osborne (softball), Logan Hale (golf), Niwot's Addy Ritzenhein (cross country) and Fairview's Quinn Bernthal (tennis) were among the honorees, which also recognized four recipients from the University of Colorado, including women's basketball coach JR Payne and star player Jaylyn Sherrod.
The organization, which has supported women's sports and outstanding female athletes since 1974, will celebrate all its honorees while unveiling its biggest award — "woman of the Year," given to the state's most outstanding athlete from 2023 — at the Hyatt Regency Denver Tech Center on March 17.
From Erie High School, Osborne was the Class 5A and Longmont Times-Call player of the year after belting 19 home runs during the fall softball season, the most by a Colorado player in at least the last 15 years. The senior's team reached the title game, and next she is set to play at Rutgers University.
In girls' golf, classmate Hale was the 4A and Times-Call winner, winning the individual class championship going away, while leading the Tigers to a second straight team title. The following summer, she made the cut at the Colorado Women's Open.
From Niwot, Ritzenhein won the 4A state title in October, then the national championship at Nike Cross in December. This is her second widely-recognized accolade of this week alone as the sophomore was named the Gatorade National Player of the Year on Tuesday.
Out of Fairview, Bernthal claimed the 5A No. 1 singles title in May, rallying to beat Cherry Creek's Lorena Cedeno in three sets in the final. For the 5A and Daily Camera POY, it served as redemption after she lost in the finals to Boulder grad Lily Chitambar the year prior.,31,sport,01eb23e44e8ade59f1a06786b48514a5,https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png

Alec Baldwin pleads not guilty in movie set shooting,Andrew Hay,2024-01-31,Boulder, CO,https://au.news.yahoo.com/alec-baldwin-pleads-not-guilty-232659471.html,Alec Baldwin has waived his right to an arraignment after he was indicted by a grand jury over a movie-set shooting, and has pleaded not guilty to manslaughter.,Actor Alec Baldwin has pleaded not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the 2021 on-set shooting death of a cinematographer during filming of the western movie Rust in New Mexico.
Baldwin made the plea on Wednesday as he waived his right to an arraignment after he was indicted by a grand jury on January 19, court documents showed.
The 30 Rock star was allowed to remain free without posting bond under the arraignment waiver with the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe.
Baldwin was originally charged for the shooting of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins in January 2023. Those charges were dropped a few months later based on evidence the hammer of the revolver might have been modified, allowing it to fire without the trigger being pulled.
The new charges came after an independent forensic test concluding that Baldwin would have had to have pulled the trigger of the revolver he was using in a rehearsal for it to fire the live round that struck Hutchins in the chest and killed her.
The finding was the same as a previous FBI test on the firearm.
Baldwin, the Emmy-winning performer, has denied pulling the trigger and said he was not responsible for the death of Hutchins.
The movie's director, Joel Souza, was struck and wounded in the shoulder by the same bullet that killed Hutchins during production of the film on a set outside Santa Fe.

How CU Boulder's 'unconventional film school' brought this Longmont-based film editor Hollywood fame,Ella Cobb,2024-01-25,Boulder, CO,https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/cu-boulders-unconventional-film-school-042300446.html,Jan. 24—When one thinks of a "Hollywood artist," what typically comes to mind are images of Elizabeth Taylor holding an Oscar or Alfred Hitchcock in a director's chair. (Or, if you're my mom, Chris…,Jan. 24—When one thinks of a "Hollywood artist," what typically comes to mind are images of Elizabeth Taylor holding an Oscar or Alfred Hitchcock in a director's chair. (Or, if you're my mom, Chris Hemsworth in a tuxedo.)
While Longmont-based Ryan Brown doesn't have sultry violet eyes or a contract with Marvel, he has gained a reputation as one of the more sought-after creatives in Hollywood for his work as an "invisible artist" — also known as a film editor.
And though it may seem rather rude to call Brown "invisible," in the case of film editing, it's a compliment — film editors spend hundreds of hours choosing screen transitions, adding sudden sounds, quick-cuts and off-screen audio to weave footage into a cohesive, easy-to-follow narrative. And for viewers, that hard work is meant to go unnoticed.
Christopher Osborn, a University of Colorado Boulder Cinema Studies post-production professor — who taught Brown as an undergraduate student — explained it best:
"As an editor, if you're very good at your craft, your imprint on a film should be invisible," Osborn said. "You don't want audiences to know that the material has been manipulated in any way. You want the whole thing to be a seamless experience."
In some cases, a film editor is selected before cast members or screenwriters, and in others, the film editor is asked to be on set with a director to help organize the flow of a shoot. In the way that some directors constantly use the same actors (think Wes Anderson and Bill Murray), some directors also choose to work with the same editors, knowing that the work of a skilled editor can make or break any film.
Brown, who graduated from CU's film program in 2001, has become the preferred editor for many directors and producers, including Jeff Baena ("Horse Girl," "Joshy," "I Heart Huckabees" — or, Aubrey Plaza's husband), Tim Robinson ("I Think You Should Leave," "Detroiters") and most recently, Jake Johnson ("New Girl").
From the comfort of his home studio in Longmont, Brown recently edited the entirety of Johnson's new film, "Self Reliance." The movie, which was released on Hulu on Jan. 14, is Johnson's directorial debut. The comedy-thriller follows the story of a middle-aged man named Tommy (Jake Johnson) who is invited into a limo by famous actor Andy Samberg, where Tommy's drab life takes a dramatic turn.
The film is charming, engaging, a little dark and a little nutty. While several funny moments come from Johnson's innate charm and comedic chemistry with the other cast members, a good portion of the laugh-out-loud moments seem to be found in the various montages of Tommy's day-to-day life and jump-cuts of close-up facial expressions that were arranged by Brown. For a directorial debut, "Self Reliance" is impressive — but perhaps owes some of its success to Brown's deft hand.
"Anything you watch on TV has been manipulated by an editor," Osborn said, with a laugh. "If you've ever gone out and shot your own stuff, and you play it back, you look like a dork. Editors help people not look like dorks. And that's really what it comes down to. There's no difference between a professional actor or some 13 year old with a webcam. An editor can make either one look badass."
When gearing up to watch a couple of scenes from Brown's extensive resume, the research task turned into viewing 300 minutes of film that Brown edited — totally on accident but with absolutely no regrets.
Throughout his impressive film reel, Brown's editing constantly weaves together a flawless storyline, creating moments that are sometimes hilarious, sometimes tense, sometimes jarring — but always engaging. This same mastery can be seen in "Self Reliance" where, despite the film's goofy characters, not a single one of them looks like — in the professor's words — a dork.
We caught up with Brown to learn what it was like to make the move from Los Angeles to Longmont, make a film with Jake Johnson and how it feels to see his work on the big screen.
Q: So it seems like every successful person in Hollywood has a story of their big break. What was yours?
A: It's been a long road. I graduated from CU in 2001, and I always knew I wanted to focus on editing. I moved to L.A. two weeks after 9/11, which was a super cool time to be getting a job. And I didn't really know anyone, so I got a job working in a post-production facility in Burbank, basically where my job was to receive actual film canisters and file them away and bring them up to the colorists upstairs. One night, I was working a graveyard shift, from like 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., and this guy came in with a big stack of film from "The Simpsons" — and remember thinking to myself, "OK, I picked the right job."
I eventually worked my way up in that company and did some editing on the side. One of my colleagues, Nick Jasenovec, started doing some directing on the side, and he happened to be friends with this guy named Bill Hader from community college. We did some short films together, and Nick ended up getting some money to make a film called "Paper Heart." We ended up getting Michael Cera on board, and we got that film into Sundance in 2009. So that was my first big break.
Q: What drew you to film editing?
A: I used to make skateboard videos. I had a camera, back before non-linear editing existed. In the early days of making videos, I was literally hooking up two VHS players together, hitting play on one, and hitting record on the other and mashing together these horrible skate videos. But it also taught me that I could tell a story in all of these different ways, using the same source material.
When I went to CU, it used to be more of an experimental-based sort of program, so we weren't making narrative kinds of films. It was a whole lot of stuff like putting paint or leaves or scratching up film negatives and running them through the projector. It was a very weird, unconventional film school, but it gave me a different outlook on what film could be, as opposed to something I would have learned at a traditional film school. It was just fun and weird and goofy and opened my eyes to my creative side.
Q: How was that move for you, going from a major entertainment hub like Los Angeles to a more quiet, slow-paced town like Longmont?
A: In March of 2020, I was working on a show called "The Other Two" on HBO, and then COVID came and everything shut down, but we were able to quickly switch to editing remotely. Nobody knew what they were doing or how to go about it, but over the course of the next few years, things caught up and we figured it out.
I love Los Angeles, but my wife and I were considering a move. We have two young kids, and we saw the pandemic as an opportunity to make that change.
It's so funny — since the move, I would be working with some famous people on the computer...like Jake Johnson or the guys from The Lonely Island would hop on a Zoom call to talk to me and give me notes, and it would be like I was back there in L.A. Then I would log off, and it would be a bit weird to go out and eat dinner with my family on main street in Longmont. It is this weird kind of dichotomy, still having one foot in the door in Los Angeles and one in a small town like Longmont.
Q: What was that like, working with Jake Johnson on his very first film as a director? Was it nerve-wracking?
A: I've known Jake for a long time. We met (working) on "Paper Heart" — he was the protagonist in that film, so he and I have known each other since 2008. We hadn't worked together professionally much in between that time, but we kind of reconnected a couple of years ago. With first-time directors, trying to establish a rapport with them can be kind of tricky. You're working very intimately with one person for months on end, and sometimes it can be difficult if you don't vibe with the director or they don't vibe with you. But as it turns out, Jake was an incredibly collaborative director, and he's always open to me trying new ideas. He was excellent to work with and was always pushing me to try new things.
In working with Jake — we were very meticulous. We showed cuts of the film to friends, and to colleagues, and kept refining and refining. We had four or five test screenings to see what people were responding to, or not responding to. It was hundreds of hours of footage, and having to make a million choices. Movies can really, really change in the editing process. You can have a great script and you can completely ruin it with a horribly edited film, or vice-versa — you can have a weak script, and you can elevate the storytelling in the editing process.
For Jake to have directed, filmed and written the film was unique — but he was very professional, being able to sit there and critique his own performances in a way that was constructive for the story without letting any kind of ego get in the way was pretty cool to witness.
Q: Before the film was released on Hulu, there was a limited one-night premiere in theaters on Jan. 3. Did you go watch the film?
A: Yeah, I did! I got a bunch of friends and we all went to see it at the AMC Flatiron Crossing in Broomfield.
Q: That's amazing! What was that like?
A: To me, editing films can be kind of a solitary task — you're sitting there in a room by yourself a lot of the time. To be able to watch it in a theater was one of the best feelings because you finally get to see how all of the jokes are landing, or how they're not landing. I had been working on this film for over a year and a half, so it's nice to finally have it out in the world for people to see.
Q: With this film, was there any performances in particular that you had fun bringing to life onscreen?
A: Yes. Christopher Lloyd is in this movie briefly — you know, the guy from "Back to the Future"? He is an absolute legend. I don't want to give away too much, because his character is in a very pivotal scene in the movie, but it was so cool to be able to cut his performance together and make it all make sense. It was one of the most challenging scenes to edit, but absolutely the most rewarding, just because Christopher Lloyd is such a legendary figure in this industry. I really hope I did him justice.
Q: It feels like your career has come full circle — starting in Colorado, going out to L.A., and now coming back — what advice would you give to the freshly graduated Ryan?
A: The best advice that I give to people who want to get into the industry is that if you want to get ahead in Hollywood, you just gotta get out and start making stuff. That's what I did!
Q: Maybe you should go teach a class or two at CU.
A: I have a secret desire to teach a class or two at CU if they'll have me. I feel like that would be something that I could help students out with. There's not a ton of people like me wandering around the Front Range, and I would love to just help students get out there and get comfortable making stuff. That's the best way to do it.

(Reuters) - Lawyers were to make opening statements on Thursday in the trial of a Michigan woman whose teenage son used a gun she and her husband allegedly gave him as a Christmas present to kill four schoolmates.
Twelve jurors and five alternates were empanelled in Pontiac, Michigan, Wednesday afternoon, the court said, to hear a rare trial of a parent facing criminal charges in a school shooting.
Jennifer Crumbley, 45, and her 47-year-old husband James Crumbley, who will be tried separately next month, are each charged with four counts of manslaughter.
Their son, Ethan, who was 15 at the time of the 2021 shooting at Oxford High School near Detroit, pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder, and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
In the past, Jennifer Crumbley's attorneys have said she could not have anticipated her son would carry out a school shooting, and that the weapon had been safely secured in the home.
She has asked Sixth Judicial Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews to force her son to testify, according to documents filed this week with the Pontiac, Michigan, court by her attorney Shannon Smith.
Public defenders representing Ethan Crumbley as he appeals his life sentence are fighting any order that would compel him to testify, and say they will advise him to invoke his right to remain silent if he is called.
Gun safety experts have said they hope the Crumbley trials serve as a wake-up call for parents around the country to better secure weapons in their homes. About 75% of school shooters obtained the guns they used in attacks within their own homes, government research has shown.
Experts have said the parents' trials break new legal ground.
Prosecutors say James Crumbley purchased the 9mm handgun used in the Oxford High attack four days before his son carried it out on Nov. 30, 2021.
On the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words "Blood everywhere," "My life is useless," and "The thoughts won't stop - help me."
The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.
Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.

(Reuters) -The mother of a Michigan boy who shot and killed four high-school classmates in 2021 testified in her own defense on Thursday, saying she was not responsible for buying or storing the gun used in the killings.
Jennifer Crumbley, 45, took the stand in what is believed to be the first trial to target a parent of a school shooter. She and her husband, James Crumbley, 47 - for whom a separate trial is to start in March - are both charged with involuntary manslaughter.
The couple's son, Ethan, who was 15 at the time of the shooting at Oxford High School near Detroit, pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in December.
Prosecutors allege that Jennifer and James Crumbley knew their son was mentally in a "downward spiral" and posed a danger to others, yet allowed him to have access to firearms, including the 9mm pistol he used to kill classmates.
Asked by her lawyer, Shannon Smith, who was responsible for securely storing firearms in the family home, Jennifer Crumbley replied: "My husband is."
"I just didn't feel comfortable being in charge of that, it was more his thing," Crumbley testified. "So I let him handle that."
She said James Crumbley kept the 9mm pistol secured in its case with a cable lock, and that the key for that lock was hidden inside one of several decorative beer steins inside the family home. Jennifer Crumbley said she did not know in which stein the key was hidden.
Jennifer Crumbley said that while her son had been anxious about getting into college and what he might do with his life, at no point did she think his problems were "to a level where I felt he needed to go see a psychiatrist."
Prosecutors will cross-examine Jennifer Crumbley on Friday.
WAKE-UP CALL FOR PARENTS
Prosecutors said as the trial opened that Jennifer and James Crumbley failed to do several "tragically small and easy things" that could have prevented the school shooting.
They argued that the guns in the home were not securely stored and that the parents should have responded to signs their son was having mental health issues.
Gun safety experts have said they hope the Crumbley trials serve as a wake-up call for parents around the country to better secure weapons in their homes. About 75% of school shooters obtained the guns they used in attacks within their own homes, government research has shown.
Prosecutors say James Crumbley purchased the 9mm handgun used in the attack four days before his son carried it out on Nov. 30, 2021.
On the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words "Blood everywhere," "My life is useless," and "The thoughts won't stop - help me."
The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan needed counseling and they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. They said the parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack or ask him about the gun.
But Jennifer Crumbley rejected that version of the school meeting in her testimony. She said that she, her husband and the teachers in the meeting mutually agreed that Ethan could remain in school that day, and that at no point did she think he was a danger to his fellow students.
The meeting "was pretty nonchalant, it was pretty brief," Crumbley testified, adding that school staff in the meeting said they "didn't feel my son was a risk."
Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.

Jan 23 (Reuters) - Jury selection begins in Michigan on Tuesday in a rare trial of a parent who prosecutors have charged with being complicit in a mass shooting carried out by her son.
Lawyers were set to start questioning prospective jurors in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, whose then-15-year-old son Ethan murdered four fellow students at Oxford High School in 2021 with a gun his parents had given him as a Christmas gift.
Ethan Crumbley pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder, and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole.
Jennifer Crumbley and her husband James Crumbley were being tried separately after being charged with four manslaughter counts in late 2021. They have remained in jail since. James Crumbley's trial opens on March 5.
When the charges were announced, prosecutors said the Crumbley's failure to both secure the gun in their home and to respond to warnings that their son, Ethan, was violent and disturbed, justified the charges they face.
Defense attorneys have said in court documents that the Crumbleys had no way of knowing their son was going to carry out the shooting.
Legal experts have said that the parents' trial, which appears to be the first of its kind, breaks new legal ground.
Josh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, said school shooter's parents are often not held to account because of feelings that "they've been through enough" or because of lax enforcement of such measures as safe storage laws.
Holding more parents responsible when appropriate is an important step, Horwitz said, given that studies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have shown that around 75% of all school shooters obtained their weapons in the home.
"Rarely are high school shooters going out and buying guns from a gun store," Horwitz said. "The broader lesson from this case is that every parent who is a gun owner has a role to play, and that's the secure and safe storage of firearms."
PREVENTABLE TRAGEDY
Four days before the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.
Michigan law prohibits those under 18 years of age from buying or possessing firearms, except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult.
Ethan posted photos of the gun on social media, writing, "Just got my new beauty today" and adding a heart emoji. The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range "testing out his new Christmas present," Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said when she announced charges against the parents.
The day before the shooting at the school near Detroit, a teacher found Ethan Crumbley using his smart phone to search for ammunition and alerted school officials. The officials left messages for his mother that went unreturned. His mother later texted him, "LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught."
On the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words "Blood everywhere," "My life is useless," and "The thoughts won't stop - help me."
Ethan told school counselors the drawings were for a video game he was designing, school officials have said.
The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.
Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.
"This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter's parents hadn't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the shooter, or if his parents had taken basic steps to securely store the gun," said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of Law and Policy at the anti-gun violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. "They should be held accountable."

A big idea for small farms: How to link agriculture, nutrition and public health,Selena Simmons-Duffin,2024-02-03,Boulder, CO,https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2024/02/03/1228749130/nutrition-farming-public-health,In Boulder, Colorado, the county is investing in sustainable farming and helping people buy local produce. It's been called "a triple win" – for customers, farmers and the economy.,A purple daikon radish grown at Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo. and other vegetables are prepared to be served at a meeting to discuss support for small Colorado farmers in December.



 
 Rachel Woolf for NPR
 
 








In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. 
 
Cordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colorado – she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.
 
"This is a green luobo," she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.
 
These locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.
 
"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food," says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. 
 




















Mark Guttridge, farmer and co-owner at Ollin Farms, feeds the chickens. The farm benefits from a county program that helps small growers get their produce to more people.



 
 Rachel Woolf for NPR
 
 








That vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. 
 




Healthy soil to healthy population
 
Before the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.
 
"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field," Guttridge laughs. "They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there."
 




















Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.



 
 Rachel Woolf for NPR
 
 








Around the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.
 
The goal of these investments is "really building up our soil health," he explains. "That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food – healthy soil grows healthy food."
 




















Jimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.



 
 Rachel Woolf for NPR
 
 








The county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. 
 




That's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families – many of mixed immigration status – can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. 
 
"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand – new people, new families," Guttridge says. "We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn." He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming – and how tasty its produce can be.
 
Win, win, win
 
Nutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. 
 
Amy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. "It's a triple win," she explains. "It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy," she explains. 
 
Then again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.
 




















Mark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.



 
 Rachel Woolf for NPR
 
 








He argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. 
 
"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn – they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables," Krieger says.
 
Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. 
 




Instead of sticks, they're using carrots – trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. 
 
A force for good
 
Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.
 
Mackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. "A lot of storage crops in here right now," she says.
 




















MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.



 
 Rachel Woolf for NPR
 
 








Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. "We have a large Nepalese community here," she says. "So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about – will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?"
 
Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. "I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here," she says.
 
Yes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. 
 
"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool," she says. "And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently."
 
Policy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident – so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.

(Reuters) - Actor Alec Baldwin on Wednesday plead not guilty to a charge of involuntary manslaughter over the 2021 on-set shooting death of cinematographer Halyna Hutchins during filming of the Western "Rust" in New Mexico.
Baldwin made the plea as he waived his right to an arraignment after he was indicted by a grand jury on Jan. 19, court documents showed.
The "30 Rock" actor was allowed to remain free without posting bond under the arraignment waiver with the First Judicial District Court in Santa Fe.
Baldwin was originally charged for the shooting in January 2023. Those charges were dropped a few months later based on evidence the hammer of the revolver might have been modified, allowing it to fire without the trigger being pulled.
The new charges came after an independent forensic test concluding that Baldwin would have had to have pulled the trigger of the revolver he was using in a rehearsal for it to fire the live round that struck Hutchins in the chest and killed her.
The finding was the same as a previous FBI test on the firearm.
Baldwin, the Emmy-winning performer, has denied pulling the trigger and said he was not responsible for the death of Hutchins.
The movie's director, Joel Souza, was struck and wounded in the shoulder by the same bullet that killed Hutchins during production of the film on a set outside Santa Fe.

(Reuters) - Lawyers were to make opening statements on Thursday in the trial of a Michigan woman whose teenage son used a gun she and her husband allegedly gave him as a Christmas present to kill four schoolmates.

Twelve jurors and five alternates were empanelled in Pontiac, Michigan, Wednesday afternoon, the court said, to hear a rare trial of a parent facing criminal charges in a school shooting.

Jennifer Crumbley, 45, and her 47-year-old husband James Crumbley, who will be tried separately next month, are each charged with four counts of manslaughter.

Their son, Ethan, who was 15 at the time of the 2021 shooting at Oxford High School near Detroit, pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder, and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole.

In the past, Jennifer Crumbley's attorneys have said she could not have anticipated her son would carry out a school shooting, and that the weapon had been safely secured in the home.

She has asked Sixth Judicial Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews to force her son to testify, according to documents filed this week with the Pontiac, Michigan, court by her attorney Shannon Smith.

Public defenders representing Ethan Crumbley as he appeals his life sentence are fighting any order that would compel him to testify, and say they will advise him to invoke his right to remain silent if he is called.

Gun safety experts have said they hope the Crumbley trials serve as a wake-up call for parents around the country to better secure weapons in their homes. About 75% of school shooters obtained the guns they used in attacks within their own homes, government research has shown.

Experts have said the parents' trials break new legal ground.

Prosecutors say James Crumbley purchased the 9mm handgun used in the Oxford High attack four days before his son carried it out on Nov. 30, 2021.

On the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words "Blood everywhere," "My life is useless," and "The thoughts won't stop - help me."

The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.

Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.

(Reuters) -The mother of a Michigan boy who shot and killed four high-school classmates in 2021 testified in her own defense on Thursday, saying she was not responsible for buying or storing the gun used in the killings.
Jennifer Crumbley, 45, took the stand in what is believed to be the first trial to target a parent of a school shooter. She and her husband, James Crumbley, 47 - for whom a separate trial is to start in March - are both charged with involuntary manslaughter.
The couple's son, Ethan, who was 15 at the time of the shooting at Oxford High School near Detroit, pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in December.
Prosecutors allege that Jennifer and James Crumbley knew their son was mentally in a "downward spiral" and posed a danger to others, yet allowed him to have access to firearms, including the 9mm pistol he used to kill classmates.
Asked by her lawyer, Shannon Smith, who was responsible for securely storing firearms in the family home, Jennifer Crumbley replied: "My husband is."
"I just didn't feel comfortable being in charge of that, it was more his thing," Crumbley testified. "So I let him handle that."
She said James Crumbley kept the 9mm pistol secured in its case with a cable lock, and that the key for that lock was hidden inside one of several decorative beer steins inside the family home. Jennifer Crumbley said she did not know in which stein the key was hidden.
Jennifer Crumbley said that while her son had been anxious about getting into college and what he might do with his life, at no point did she think his problems were "to a level where I felt he needed to go see a psychiatrist."
Prosecutors will cross-examine Jennifer Crumbley on Friday.
WAKE-UP CALL FOR PARENTS
Prosecutors said as the trial opened that Jennifer and James Crumbley failed to do several "tragically small and easy things" that could have prevented the school shooting.
They argued that the guns in the home were not securely stored and that the parents should have responded to signs their son was having mental health issues.
Gun safety experts have said they hope the Crumbley trials serve as a wake-up call for parents around the country to better secure weapons in their homes. About 75% of school shooters obtained the guns they used in attacks within their own homes, government research has shown.
Prosecutors say James Crumbley purchased the 9mm handgun used in the attack four days before his son carried it out on Nov. 30, 2021.
On the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words "Blood everywhere," "My life is useless," and "The thoughts won't stop - help me."
The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan needed counseling and they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. They said the parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack or ask him about the gun.
But Jennifer Crumbley rejected that version of the school meeting in her testimony. She said that she, her husband and the teachers in the meeting mutually agreed that Ethan could remain in school that day, and that at no point did she think he was a danger to his fellow students.
The meeting "was pretty nonchalant, it was pretty brief," Crumbley testified, adding that school staff in the meeting said they "didn't feel my son was a risk."
Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.

Colorado man dies in skydiving incident near Vance Brand Airport,Austen Erblat,2024-01-28,Boulder, CO,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/skydiver-dies-near-vance-brand-airport-in-colorado,Few details were immediately available but a spokesperson for the Longmont Police and Fire Departments said the 36-year-old man died during the "incident" Saturday afternoon.,A skydiver has died under unknown circumstances near Vance Brand Airport, a city-owned airport in Longmont, about 40 miles northwest of Denver.

Few details were immediately available but a spokesperson for the Longmont Police and Fire Departments said the 36-year-old Colorado man died just before 3:30 p.m. Saturday.

The man was skydiving with Mile High Skydiving and wearing a wingsuit and it appears neither his primary nor his reserve chute opened before he hit the ground.

The man will be identified by the Boulder County Coroner's Office and now the FAA is investigating the incident in conjunction with the coroner's office and Longmont Police Department.

The FAA said it was aware of the death and is assisting in the investigation from the perspective of the packing of the parachutes and rules of flight for the pilot and aircraft.

CBS News Colorado reached out to airport and Mile High Skydiving for comment, but neither immediately responded Sunday.

The airport has made headlines for the number of skydiving deaths associated with it over the past few years.

In 2021, a Boulder man was killed in a skydiving accident there, which was at least the fifth death associated with the airport at the time since 2018.

According to the FAA, 30 to 40 people die in skydiving incidents in the U.S. each year, which it calls an "extraordinarily high rate" of almost two deaths per 1,000 skydives.

The airport opened in 1945 and was named after pilot and NASA astronaut Vance Brand, who's from Longmont, in 1988. It has 219 aircraft based out of it and had an average of 242 flight operations per day in 2019, according to data from the FAA.,204,news,3dbd5e2deff363b596a2264ef3701517,https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/01/28/0fb37a45-6583-426d-8154-86c3d2f4bc35/thumbnail/1200x630/195fee369dd1066038e3826cc2bbe068/gettyimages-1094057952.jpg?v=9bdba4fec5b17ee7e8ba9ef8c71cf431

The elder Sanders bought a house in Longmont, Colorado, last March.

Shilo and Shedeur Sanders are both set to play one final season for their father at Colorado before heading to the 2025 NFL Draft. The elder Sanders signed a five-year contract in December 2022 that will keep him at the school long after his two sons declare for the draft.

80 dogs removed from unlicensed Colorado sanctuary,Logan Smith,2024-02-02,Boulder, CO,https://www.cbsnews.com/colorado/news/80-dogs-removed-from-unlicensed-colorado-sanctuary,Eighty large northern-breed dogs were removed from a property outside Lyons this week, two days after a judge signed a permanent injunction when the landowner failed to show up at a court hearing.,Eighty large northern-breed dogs were removed from a property outside Lyons this week, two days after a judge signed a permanent injunction when the landowner failed to show up at a court hearing.

Vehicles and personnel from a dozen animal welfare organizations drove away with the mostly large northern-breed dogs (predominantly huskies and husky mixes) from Just 4 Jacks Ranch and Sanctuary. The 78 dogs taken Thursday were sent as far away as Cheyenne. One dog escaped its leash during transfer from the property to a vehicle and is still unaccounted for.

The last two dogs were unapproachable Thursday, according to a spokesman from the NoCo Humane Society, one of the responding agencies. Both of those dogs were caught Friday when staffers returned.

A spokesperson with the Colorado Department of Agriculture said one dog was euthanized prior to the authorities' arrival by the sanctuary owner, Drew Renkewitz.

Reached by phone Friday, Renkewitz, 59, said he was in a courtroom trying to get his dogs back.

Vehicles are shown backed up to a dog housing facility near Lyons on Thursday. The animals were taken from the Just 4 Jacks Ranch and Sanctuary following a court order. NoCo Humane Society

Tuesday, a permanent injunction was ordered against Renkewitz by a district court judge in Fort Collins (the Just 4 Jacks Ranch at 1740 Spring Gulch Drive is located in Larimer County northwest of Lyons). The order details how Renkewitz was first contacted a year ago by a representative of the Department of Agriculture's Pet Animal Care and Facilities Act (PACFA) Program when 56 dogs were found on the ranch property. The rep at that time "advised Defendant Renkewitz that he could not harbor, house, or shelter more than fifteen (15) dogs in his home without a PACFA license."

Renkewitz applied for a license in March, but the court document indicates Renkewitz's property failed subsequent PACFA inspections on April 4, 2023, June 20, 2023, August 1, 2023, and October 16, 2023.

The license was officially denied in late October, and a cease-and-desist order was made. An administrative search warrant was obtained by state authorities in December. They counted 82 dogs on the property.

A permanent injunction was initially ordered to take effect the last day of January 2024, the court document states. However, Renkewitz requested a status conference for Jan. 30. That is the hearing which is reportedly failed to appear. "The Court paused the proceedings for 45 minutes to await (Renkewitz's) arrival," as stated in the document, before granting the state's motion for permanent injunction.

Olga Robak of the Colorado Department of Agriculture told CBS News Colorado that Renkewitz claimed to have plans to move out of state but continued to operate the unlicensed facility despite court order.

Nick Fisher, the PACFA Program Section Chief, stated in a press release that state and county authorities prepared all month for Renkewitz's eviction. "While this was a challenging situation, the dogs have been taken in by animal welfare experts and will be examined and treated by veterinarians and hopefully they will be ready for adoption in the near future," Fisher said.

All the dogs were "all relatively healthy and in good behaviors" at the time of transport from the property, Scott Wendelberger of NoCo Humane Society told CBS News Colorado.

Just 4 Jacks Ranch and Sanctuary is registered as a non-profit organization with the Internal Revenue Service.

The ranch benefitted from a concert fundraiser in Lyons last July, per an article in the Longmont Times-Call. Renkewitz, according to that article, named the ranch after his four Jack Russell terriers when he arrived from New York in 2020. He started the sanctuary to care for dogs in need and keep them from being surrendered to high-kill shelters, as stated in the article.

"We recognize that this is a challenging and devastating situation for all involved," stated Judy Calhoun, CEO of NOCO Humane, in a press release. "We are happy to report that the dogs appear to be both healthy and well-socialized with other dogs and people. Hopefully, this means that they won't need to spend too much time in an unfamiliar shelter environment, especially since these dogs are accustomed to living outdoors. We anticipate that these dogs will be excellent adoption candidates, and we look forward to finding each of them a home.

"I'm sure these dogs are going to bring a lot of smiles to the faces of their new families."

A man wearing a wingsuit fell to his death in a skydiving incident 
in Colorado
 on Saturday after both his primary and reserve parachutes failed to deploy.
Gregory Coates, 36, was skydiving near Vance Brand Airport in Longmont just before 3:30 p.m. when tragedy struck, according to the Boulder County Coroner's Office. The airport is about 40 miles north of Denver and the incident took place in the area of Nelson Road and Grandview Meadows Drive in Longmont.
Coates, who was from a mountain community near the 
Denver Metro
 area, was wearing a wingsuit and was jumping with the Mile-Hi Skydiving Center, which is based at the airport, the Longmont Police Department said. A wingsuit skydiver wears a specialized webbed-sleeved jumpsuit with membranes between the arms, body and legs, which allows a 
diver to glide flight in the air
.
 
 

According to several reports, neither Coates' primary nor his reserve chute opened. It is not known what level of experience he had at skydiving or what type of aircraft he jumped out of.
The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) was notified of the incident, but they did not respond to the scene, according to Fox 17.
The FAA told Fox News Digital it investigates the packing of the main and reserve parachutes and the rules of flight for the pilot and aircraft. The FAA does not determine the cause of skydiving incidents, a spokesperson said. 
Fox News Digital requested comment from Mile-Hi Skydiving Center but did not immediately receive a response. 
 
 

Saturday's deadly incident is not the first linked to Mile-Hi Skydiving Center.
In 2018, a 23-year-old man died while jumping with the company, according to Fox 17, which reports that the city has raised concerns about the 
company's safety record in the past
.
In 2008, a skydiving instructor and his student 
died after a fall while doing a tandem jump
 over the airport. 
 
 

More recently, a 26-year-old Boulder man was killed in a solo jump with the company in 2021, marking the fifth fatality connected to Mile-Hi Skydiving since 2018, according to CBS. 
The FAA says there are around 30 to 40 fatalities among skydivers each year, calling it an "extraordinarily high rate."
The United States Parachute Association, a private sports organization, says about 4 million 
skydives were made in the  last year
. Of those, more than 500,000 were first-timers.,249,news,f3ac3cf14a9beed4c8eb4bcce98d1fa7,https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2024/01/skydive2.jpg
A big idea for small farms: How to link agriculture, nutrition and public health,Selena Simmons-Duffin,2024-02-03,Boulder, CO,https://www.nhpr.org/2024-02-03/a-big-idea-for-small-farms-how-to-link-agriculture-nutrition-and-public-health,In Boulder, Colorado, the county is investing in sustainable farming and helping people buy local produce. It's been called "a triple win" – for customers, farmers and the economy.,In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays.

Cordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colorado – she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.

"This is a green luobo," she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.

These locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.

"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food," says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago.

That vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level.

Healthy soil to healthy population

Before the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.

"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field," Guttridge laughs. "They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there."

/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.

Around the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.

The goal of these investments is "really building up our soil health," he explains. "That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food – healthy soil grows healthy food."

/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Jimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.

The county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health.

That's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families – many of mixed immigration status – can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand.

"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand – new people, new families," Guttridge says. "We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn." He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming – and how tasty its produce can be.

Win, win, win

Nutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill.

Amy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. "It's a triple win," she explains. "It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy," she explains.

Then again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.

/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Mark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.

He argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right.

"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn – they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables," Krieger says.

Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach.

Instead of sticks, they're using carrots – trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition.

A force for good

Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.

Mackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. "A lot of storage crops in here right now," she says.

/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.

Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. "We have a large Nepalese community here," she says. "So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about – will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?"

Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. "I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here," she says.

Yes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people.

"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool," she says. "And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently."

Policy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident – so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.

Why Xcel Energy's push to expand EV incentives has divided climate and consumer advocates,Sam Brasch,2024-01-26,Boulder, CO,https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/why-xcel-energys-push-to-expand-ev-incentives-has-divided-climate-and-consumer-advocates/,Buying an electric vehicle could soon be even cheaper for millions of Coloradans. The state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of…,Buying an electric vehicle could soon be even cheaper for millions of Coloradans.
 
The state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of efforts to address climate change. Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility company, is now pushing regulators to allow its customers to tack on additional rebates worth up to $5,500.
 
If successful, some Colorado residents could theoretically qualify for $19,000 in total discounts, not counting any additional cash available through the federal EV tax credit. As a result, someone could soon combine enough discounts to nearly cover the price of an entry-level EV.
 
Xcel Energy, cities like Boulder and Denver, Tesla Motors, and environmental groups claim the benefit will help clean up the transportation sector, the state's largest single source of climate-warming emissions. But consumer advocates and major energy users say energy customers shouldn't be required to subsidize car purchases through their electric bills.
 
The proposal for 'stackable' rebates would eliminate restrictions that have already frustrated some Colorado EV buyers
 
That includes Adian Nye, a retired flight instructor and software engineer living in Longmont. After years of driving a Nissan Pathfinder, he resolved that his next car wouldn't be a gas-guzzling SUV.
 
Some online research convinced Nye an EV could fit his budget. From what he could tell, a Telsa Model 3 could qualify for a generous suite of federal and state tax credits – plus an additional $5,500 rebate for income-qualified Xcel Energy customers. He appeared to fit the bill based on his current earnings.
 
Nye discovered a critical flaw in the system after buying the vehicle last March. While it wasn't mentioned on the utility's public-facing website at the time, some fine print on the rebate application revealed he could not combine the Xcel Energy discount with a $5,000 state tax credit.
 
In effect, his car wasn't anywhere close to the bargain he'd hoped for.
 
'I felt like I was misled,' Nye said. 'Xcel was making a big deal about this rebate, and it really wasn't offering much of anything.'
 
The utility now wants regulators to get rid of the rules altogether. If approved later this month, its $437 million proposal would clear a path for a Colorado resident to theoretically collect $26,500 in discounts for a battery-powered vehicle – an amount equal to the cost of some entry-level electric cars.
 
Xcel Energy claims its plan to use ratepayer money to further subsidize EV purchases would help Colorado achieve its goal of putting 940,000 EVs on the road by 2030
 
While the state is a hot spot of EV adoption, recent car registration data show it is only about one-tenth of the way toward the target set by Gov. Jared Polis.
 
To close the gap, the company has called for a major investment in EV chargers, directing more than half of the nearly half-billion-dollar plan to support charging infrastructure on private properties like apartments and delivery depots.
 
Roughly 4% of the proposed budget would go toward EV rebates, reserving the greatest benefit for low-income residents who often can't afford the higher upfront costs of battery-powered cars.
 
The proposal would offer an 'income-qualified rebate' worth $5,500 for new cars or $3,000 for used cars. To qualify, customers must earn less than 80% of their county's median income or already participate in specific public benefit programs.
 
A 'community rebate' worth $2,750 for new cars or $1,500 for used cars would be available to customers living in areas defined as 'disproportionately impacted communities.' Those are areas heavily impacted by air and water pollution, which Colorado defines using a mapping tool called EnvroScreen. Tribal members would qualify for the same incentives.
 
Additional rebates would be available to help local governments and ride-share companies purchase EVs.
 
Supporters of the plan further claim the investments wouldn't have a significant impact on energy bills
 
Tyler Bryant, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said the broad support for the proposal reflects agreement on the overall benefits of putting more EVs on the road. Besides reductions in climate-warming emissions and local air pollution, he said more cars plugging into the grid would spread out the cost of providing electricity service, putting downward pressure on energy costs in the long term.
 
'In other words, the growth of electric vehicles more than pays for itself, funds customer programs and utility infrastructure and provides savings to all customers,' Bryant said.
 
That's a subtle point based on the complex economics of public utilities. A recent state analysis found the plan would likely increase the average residential electricity bill by $. 66 per month over the next three years. The average business will see its monthly costs rise by about $2.27.
 
But supporters say Xcel Energy's proposal would eventually lead to savings that exceed additional costs on energy bills.
 
Travis Madsen, transportation program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said EVs will help customers avoid costs otherwise spent on gas or vehicle maintenance. In addition, the extra revenue from owners paying for electricity could help cut costs for all ratepayers.
 
For evidence, he pointed to a 2021 study commissioned by the Colorado Energy Office, which found that additional revenue could cut the average customer utility bill by more than 2% by 2050.
 
The line of argument has so far failed to convince the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which represents ratepayers before the state utility commission
 
The office is fighting the proposal along with trail staff for the Public Utilities Commission and large energy consumers. The coalition has argued the proposal lacks a mechanism to guarantee that customers will benefit from lower rates if more vehicles plug into the grid.
 
Consumer advocates also see the EV rebates as unnecessary, given the number of incentives already available in Colorado. Opponents are further concerned Xcel Energy wants to classify vehicle rebates as capital expenses – typically reserved things like power plants and transmission lines – rather than operating costs.
 
While that might sound like a wonky financial distinction, it could allow the company to recover the costs of the EV incentives from customers – plus an additional stream of new profit for shareholders.
 
Cindy Schonhaut, the director of the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, said the plan violates the long-running compact between the state and investor-owned utilities. Since the Progressive Era, state regulators have tended to only allow companies to profit from major infrastructure investments like power plants and transmission lines. Meanwhile, operating expenses – such as staff salaries or coal purchases – are passed onto customers without any markups.
 
She's shocked the utility now wants to claim discounts for privately owned vehicles, which could count as 'infrastructure' and help the company generate a profit. 'What they've proposed is incredibly greedy,' Shonhaut said.
 
Xcel Energy posted a record $1.74 billion in profits in 2022, financial filings show, and its quarterly earning reports suggest it will likely beat that mark in 2023.
 
The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue a final decision on the updated program later this Spring.,13843,news,3dedb8a4624c38c97ca209a0ed938480,https://imengine.public.prod.dur.navigacloud.com/?uuid=696B8737-8490-4444-9DA5-2DFDCBAB54BF&function=fit&type=preview

Slow start dooms Chadron State men vs. Fort Lewis
 
The Chadron State College men's basketball team got off to stumbling start, making only three of 18 field goal attempts while falling behind 26-7 in the first 12 minutes and ultimately lost to Fort Lewis 88-72 in a Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference game played in Durango, Colo., on Friday night.              After the dreadful beginning, the Eagles did better. They were still behind 40-28 at halftime, but cut the difference to 44-39 some 3 ½ minutes into the second half. However, the Skyhawks went on an 8-0 run and led by between 12 and 20 points the rest of the way.             For the game, Fort Lewis shot 56.4% (31-55) and the Eagles 37.9% (25-66).  Paced by six 3-pointers by Dalton Peterson, Chadron State had 10 treys, one more than the Skyhawks, Peterson's 18 points led the visitors in scoring. Fellow guard Bryce Latimer scored 17 points and handed out a game-high six assists.             Also for the Eagles, forward Josh Robinson added 14 points and grabbed a game-high nine rebounds, although Fort Lewis won the battle off the glass 42-35.             The Skyhawks' Agbim Obi, who was 5-of-7 on 3-pointers, was the game's top scorer with 21 points while Junior Garbrah was both 6-of-9 from the field and at the free throw line while scoring 20 points. Six-foot-nine Brayden Carter added 10 points and led his team with eight rebounds.              The Skyhawks, who entered the game ranked 12th in NCAA Division II, are now 14-2 for the season and 9-1 in the RMAC.  Chadron State is 9-7 and 6-4.

Fort Lewis women defeat Chadron State 71-58
 
Sophomore guard Lanae Billy scored 28 points while leading the Fort Lewis College women's basketball team to a 71-58 win over Chadron State on Friday night in Durango, Colo., even though the Eagles held an 11-4 lead at end of the first quarter when the homestanding Skyhawks made just one of their 19 field goal attempts that period.             The Eagles were at a disadvantage before the game started because two of their top five scorers—Megan Counts and Allison Olsen—were ill and could not play unable to play. Things got much worse early in the second frame when their leading scorer and rebounder, all-conference standout Shay Powers, injured her left wrist when she fell to the floor and did not return to action.             The Skyhawks got their offense on track in the second quarter, when they sank five 3-pointers, four of them by Billy, and made six of seven free throws while outscoring Chadron State 23-9 to take  a 27-20 halftime lead. The hosts also had an excellent third stanza, when they were nine of 18 from the field and also made eight free throws to build their margin to 55-40.Billy was nine of 21 from the field, including six of 15 on 3-point attempts, and went four of five at the free throw line for her 28 points.  A year ago when the teams played in Chadron, the 5-7 Billy scored 29 points, but the Eagles won 66-61 behind Powers' 27 points.  Powers had just two points Friday nightbefore she was forced to leave the game.             Also for Fort Lewis this time, a pair of 6-footers, Kelsey Sorenson and Kate Gallery, added 13 and 10 points, respectively.              Despite missing three of their key players for all or most of the game, the Eagles out-rebounded the taller Skyhawks 46-31, but the visitors turned the ball over 26 times compared to just 10 by Fort Lewis.              Chadron State was led in scoring by Awoti Akoi and Camren Morris with 10 points apiece.

A big idea for small farms: How to link agriculture, nutrition and public health,Selena Simmons-Duffin,2024-02-03,Boulder, CO,https://www.wlrn.org/npr-breaking-news/2024-02-03/a-big-idea-for-small-farms-how-to-link-agriculture-nutrition-and-public-health,In Boulder, Colo., the county is investing in sustainable farming and helping people buy local produce. It's been called "a triple win" – for customers, farmers and the economy.,In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. 
 
Cordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. — she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips. 
 
"This is a green luobo," she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds. 
 
These locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon. 
 
"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food," says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. 
 
That vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. 
 
Healthy soil to healthy population
 
Before the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop. 
 
"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field," Guttridge laughs. "They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there." 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.
 
 




Around the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on. 
 
The goal of these investments is "really building up our soil health," he explains. "That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food — healthy soil grows healthy food." 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.
 
 




The county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. 
 
That's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families — many of mixed immigration status — can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. 
 
"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand – new people, new families," Guttridge says. "We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn." He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming – and how tasty its produce can be. 
 
Win, win, win
 
Nutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. 
 
Amy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. "It's a triple win," she explains. "It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy," she explains. 
 
Then again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.

He argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. 
 
"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn – they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables," Krieger says. 
 
Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. 
 
Instead of sticks, they're using carrots – trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. 
 
A force for good
 
Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery. 
 
Mackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. "A lot of storage crops in here right now," she says.

Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. "We have a large Nepalese community here," she says. "So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about – will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?" 
 
Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. "I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here," she says. 
 
Yes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. 
 
"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool," she says. "And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently." 
Policy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident — so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.

Why Xcel Energy's push to expand EV incentives has divided climate and consumer advocates,Sam Brasch,2024-01-26,Boulder, CO,https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/why-xcel-energys-push-to-expand-ev-incentives-has-divided-climate-and-consumer-advocates/,Buying an electric vehicle could soon be even cheaper for millions of Coloradans. The state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of…,Buying an electric vehicle could soon be even cheaper for millions of Coloradans.
 
The state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of efforts to address climate change. Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility company, is now pushing regulators to allow its customers to tack on additional rebates worth up to $5,500.
 
If successful, some Colorado residents could theoretically qualify for $19,000 in total discounts, not counting any additional cash available through the federal EV tax credit. As a result, someone could soon combine enough discounts to nearly cover the price of an entry-level EV.
 
Xcel Energy, cities like Boulder and Denver, Tesla Motors, and environmental groups claim the benefit will help clean up the transportation sector, the state's largest single source of climate-warming emissions. But consumer advocates and major energy users say energy customers shouldn't be required to subsidize car purchases through their electric bills.
 
The proposal for 'stackable' rebates would eliminate restrictions that have already frustrated some Colorado EV buyers
 
That includes Adian Nye, a retired flight instructor and software engineer living in Longmont. After years of driving a Nissan Pathfinder, he resolved that his next car wouldn't be a gas-guzzling SUV.
 
Some online research convinced Nye an EV could fit his budget. From what he could tell, a Telsa Model 3 could qualify for a generous suite of federal and state tax credits – plus an additional $5,500 rebate for income-qualified Xcel Energy customers. He appeared to fit the bill based on his current earnings.
 
Nye discovered a critical flaw in the system after buying the vehicle last March. While it wasn't mentioned on the utility's public-facing website at the time, some fine print on the rebate application revealed he could not combine the Xcel Energy discount with a $5,000 state tax credit.
 
In effect, his car wasn't anywhere close to the bargain he'd hoped for.
 
'I felt like I was misled,' Nye said. 'Xcel was making a big deal about this rebate, and it really wasn't offering much of anything.'
 
The utility now wants regulators to get rid of the rules altogether. If approved later this month, its $437 million proposal would clear a path for a Colorado resident to theoretically collect $26,500 in discounts for a battery-powered vehicle – an amount equal to the cost of some entry-level electric cars.
 
Xcel Energy claims its plan to use ratepayer money to further subsidize EV purchases would help Colorado achieve its goal of putting 940,000 EVs on the road by 2030
 
While the state is a hot spot of EV adoption, recent car registration data show it is only about one-tenth of the way toward the target set by Gov. Jared Polis.
 
To close the gap, the company has called for a major investment in EV chargers, directing more than half of the nearly half-billion-dollar plan to support charging infrastructure on private properties like apartments and delivery depots.
 
Roughly 4% of the proposed budget would go toward EV rebates, reserving the greatest benefit for low-income residents who often can't afford the higher upfront costs of battery-powered cars.
 
The proposal would offer an 'income-qualified rebate' worth $5,500 for new cars or $3,000 for used cars. To qualify, customers must earn less than 80% of their county's median income or already participate in specific public benefit programs.
 
A 'community rebate' worth $2,750 for new cars or $1,500 for used cars would be available to customers living in areas defined as 'disproportionately impacted communities.' Those are areas heavily impacted by air and water pollution, which Colorado defines using a mapping tool called EnvroScreen. Tribal members would qualify for the same incentives.
 
Additional rebates would be available to help local governments and ride-share companies purchase EVs.
 
Supporters of the plan further claim the investments wouldn't have a significant impact on energy bills
 
Tyler Bryant, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said the broad support for the proposal reflects agreement on the overall benefits of putting more EVs on the road. Besides reductions in climate-warming emissions and local air pollution, he said more cars plugging into the grid would spread out the cost of providing electricity service, putting downward pressure on energy costs in the long term.
 
'In other words, the growth of electric vehicles more than pays for itself, funds customer programs and utility infrastructure and provides savings to all customers,' Bryant said.
 
That's a subtle point based on the complex economics of public utilities. A recent state analysis found the plan would likely increase the average residential electricity bill by $. 66 per month over the next three years. The average business will see its monthly costs rise by about $2.27.
 
But supporters say Xcel Energy's proposal would eventually lead to savings that exceed additional costs on energy bills.
 
Travis Madsen, transportation program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said EVs will help customers avoid costs otherwise spent on gas or vehicle maintenance. In addition, the extra revenue from owners paying for electricity could help cut costs for all ratepayers.
 
For evidence, he pointed to a 2021 study commissioned by the Colorado Energy Office, which found that additional revenue could cut the average customer utility bill by more than 2% by 2050.
 
The line of argument has so far failed to convince the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which represents ratepayers before the state utility commission
 
The office is fighting the proposal along with trail staff for the Public Utilities Commission and large energy consumers. The coalition has argued the proposal lacks a mechanism to guarantee that customers will benefit from lower rates if more vehicles plug into the grid.
 
Consumer advocates also see the EV rebates as unnecessary, given the number of incentives already available in Colorado. Opponents are further concerned Xcel Energy wants to classify vehicle rebates as capital expenses – typically reserved things like power plants and transmission lines – rather than operating costs.
 
While that might sound like a wonky financial distinction, it could allow the company to recover the costs of the EV incentives from customers – plus an additional stream of new profit for shareholders.
 
Cindy Schonhaut, the director of the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, said the plan violates the long-running compact between the state and investor-owned utilities. Since the Progressive Era, state regulators have tended to only allow companies to profit from major infrastructure investments like power plants and transmission lines. Meanwhile, operating expenses – such as staff salaries or coal purchases – are passed onto customers without any markups.
 
She's shocked the utility now wants to claim discounts for privately owned vehicles, which could count as 'infrastructure' and help the company generate a profit. 'What they've proposed is incredibly greedy,' Shonhaut said.
 
Xcel Energy posted a record $1.74 billion in profits in 2022, financial filings show, and its quarterly earning reports suggest it will likely beat that mark in 2023.
 
The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue a final decision on the updated program later this Spring.,13843,news,3dedb8a4624c38c97ca209a0ed938480,https://imengine.public.prod.dur.navigacloud.com/?uuid=696B8737-8490-4444-9DA5-2DFDCBAB54BF&function=fit&type=preview

A big idea for small farms: How to link agriculture, nutrition and public health,Selena Simmons-Duffin,2024-02-03,Boulder, CO,https://www.wlrn.org/npr-breaking-news/2024-02-03/a-big-idea-for-small-farms-how-to-link-agriculture-nutrition-and-public-health,In Boulder, Colo., the county is investing in sustainable farming and helping people buy local produce. It's been called "a triple win" – for customers, farmers and the economy.,In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. 
 
Cordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. — she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips. 
 
"This is a green luobo," she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds. 
 
These locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon. 
 
"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food," says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. 
 
That vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. 
 
Healthy soil to healthy population
 
Before the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop. 
 
"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field," Guttridge laughs. "They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there."

Nutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. 
 
Amy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. "It's a triple win," she explains.

Then again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.

He argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. 
 
"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn – they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables," Krieger says. 
 
Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach.

Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says.

Yes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. 
 
"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool," she says. "And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently." 
Policy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident — so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.

A big idea for small farms: How to link agriculture, nutrition and public health,Selena Simmons-Duffin,2024-02-03,Boulder, CO,https://www.nhpr.org/2024-02-03/a-big-idea-for-small-farms-how-to-link-agriculture-nutrition-and-public-health,In Boulder, Colorado, the county is investing in sustainable farming and helping people buy local produce. It's been called "a triple win" – for customers, farmers and the economy.,In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays.

Cordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colorado – she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.

"This is a green luobo," she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.

These locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.

"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food," says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago.

That vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level.

Healthy soil to healthy population

Before the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.

"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field," Guttridge laughs. "They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there."

Why Xcel Energy's push to expand EV incentives has divided climate and consumer advocates,Sam Brasch,2024-01-26,Boulder, CO,https://www.durangoherald.com/articles/why-xcel-energys-push-to-expand-ev-incentives-has-divided-climate-and-consumer-advocates/,Buying an electric vehicle could soon be even cheaper for millions of Coloradans. The state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of…,Buying an electric vehicle could soon be even cheaper for millions of Coloradans.
 
The state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of efforts to address climate change. Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility company, is now pushing regulators to allow its customers to tack on additional rebates worth up to $5,500.
 
If successful, some Colorado residents could theoretically qualify for $19,000 in total discounts, not counting any additional cash available through the federal EV tax credit. As a result, someone could soon combine enough discounts to nearly cover the price of an entry-level EV.
 
Xcel Energy, cities like Boulder and Denver, Tesla Motors, and environmental groups claim the benefit will help clean up the transportation sector, the state's largest single source of climate-warming emissions. But consumer advocates and major energy users say energy customers shouldn't be required to subsidize car purchases through their electric bills.
 
The proposal for 'stackable' rebates would eliminate restrictions that have already frustrated some Colorado EV buyers
 
That includes Adian Nye, a retired flight instructor and software engineer living in Longmont. After years of driving a Nissan Pathfinder, he resolved that his next car wouldn't be a gas-guzzling SUV.
 
Some online research convinced Nye an EV could fit his budget. From what he could tell, a Telsa Model 3 could qualify for a generous suite of federal and state tax credits – plus an additional $5,500 rebate for income-qualified Xcel Energy customers. He appeared to fit the bill based on his current earnings.
 
Nye discovered a critical flaw in the system after buying the vehicle last March. While it wasn't mentioned on the utility's public-facing website at the time, some fine print on the rebate application revealed he could not combine the Xcel Energy discount with a $5,000 state tax credit.
 
In effect, his car wasn't anywhere close to the bargain he'd hoped for.
 
'I felt like I was misled,' Nye said. 'Xcel was making a big deal about this rebate, and it really wasn't offering much of anything.'
 
The utility now wants regulators to get rid of the rules altogether. If approved later this month, its $437 million proposal would clear a path for a Colorado resident to theoretically collect $26,500 in discounts for a battery-powered vehicle – an amount equal to the cost of some entry-level electric cars.
 
Xcel Energy claims its plan to use ratepayer money to further subsidize EV purchases would help Colorado achieve its goal of putting 940,000 EVs on the road by 2030
 
While the state is a hot spot of EV adoption, recent car registration data show it is only about one-tenth of the way toward the target set by Gov. Jared Polis.
 
To close the gap, the company has called for a major investment in EV chargers, directing more than half of the nearly half-billion-dollar plan to support charging infrastructure on private properties like apartments and delivery depots.
 
Roughly 4% of the proposed budget would go toward EV rebates, reserving the greatest benefit for low-income residents who often can't afford the higher upfront costs of battery-powered cars.
 
The proposal would offer an 'income-qualified rebate' worth $5,500 for new cars or $3,000 for used cars. To qualify, customers must earn less than 80% of their county's median income or already participate in specific public benefit programs.
 
A 'community rebate' worth $2,750 for new cars or $1,500 for used cars would be available to customers living in areas defined as 'disproportionately impacted communities.' Those are areas heavily impacted by air and water pollution, which Colorado defines using a mapping tool called EnvroScreen. Tribal members would qualify for the same incentives.
 
Additional rebates would be available to help local governments and ride-share companies purchase EVs.
 
Supporters of the plan further claim the investments wouldn't have a significant impact on energy bills
 
Tyler Bryant, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said the broad support for the proposal reflects agreement on the overall benefits of putting more EVs on the road. Besides reductions in climate-warming emissions and local air pollution, he said more cars plugging into the grid would spread out the cost of providing electricity service, putting downward pressure on energy costs in the long term.
 
'In other words, the growth of electric vehicles more than pays for itself, funds customer programs and utility infrastructure and provides savings to all customers,' Bryant said.
 
That's a subtle point based on the complex economics of public utilities. A recent state analysis found the plan would likely increase the average residential electricity bill by $. 66 per month over the next three years. The average business will see its monthly costs rise by about $2.27.
 
But supporters say Xcel Energy's proposal would eventually lead to savings that exceed additional costs on energy bills.
 
Travis Madsen, transportation program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said EVs will help customers avoid costs otherwise spent on gas or vehicle maintenance. In addition, the extra revenue from owners paying for electricity could help cut costs for all ratepayers.
 
For evidence, he pointed to a 2021 study commissioned by the Colorado Energy Office, which found that additional revenue could cut the average customer utility bill by more than 2% by 2050.
 
The line of argument has so far failed to convince the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which represents ratepayers before the state utility commission
 
The office is fighting the proposal along with trail staff for the Public Utilities Commission and large energy consumers. The coalition has argued the proposal lacks a mechanism to guarantee that customers will benefit from lower rates if more vehicles plug into the grid.
 
Consumer advocates also see the EV rebates as unnecessary, given the number of incentives already available in Colorado. Opponents are further concerned Xcel Energy wants to classify vehicle rebates as capital expenses – typically reserved things like power plants and transmission lines – rather than operating costs.
 
While that might sound like a wonky financial distinction, it could allow the company to recover the costs of the EV incentives from customers – plus an additional stream of new profit for shareholders.
 
Cindy Schonhaut, the director of the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, said the plan violates the long-running compact between the state and investor-owned utilities. Since the Progressive Era, state regulators have tended to only allow companies to profit from major infrastructure investments like power plants and transmission lines. Meanwhile, operating expenses – such as staff salaries or coal purchases – are passed onto customers without any markups.
 
She's shocked the utility now wants to claim discounts for privately owned vehicles, which could count as 'infrastructure' and help the company generate a profit. 'What they've proposed is incredibly greedy,' Shonhaut said.
 
Xcel Energy posted a record $1.74 billion in profits in 2022, financial filings show, and its quarterly earning reports suggest it will likely beat that mark in 2023.
 
The Colorado Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue a final decision on the updated program later this Spring.,13843,news,3dedb8a4624c38c97ca209a0ed938480,https://imengine.public.prod.dur.navigacloud.com/?uuid=696B8737-8490-4444-9DA5-2DFDCBAB54BF&function=fit&type=preview

A big idea for small farms: How to link agriculture, nutrition and public health,Selena Simmons-Duffin,2024-02-03,Boulder, CO,https://www.wlrn.org/npr-breaking-news/2024-02-03/a-big-idea-for-small-farms-how-to-link-agriculture-nutrition-and-public-health,In Boulder, Colo., the county is investing in sustainable farming and helping people buy local produce. It's been called "a triple win" – for customers, farmers and the economy.,In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. 
 
Cordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. — she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips. 
 
"This is a green luobo," she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds. 
 
These locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon. 
 
"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food," says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. 
 
That vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. 
 
Healthy soil to healthy population
 
Before the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop. 
 
"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field," Guttridge laughs. "They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there." 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.
 
 




Around the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on. 
 
The goal of these investments is "really building up our soil health," he explains. "That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food — healthy soil grows healthy food." 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Jimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.
 
 




The county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. 
 
That's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families — many of mixed immigration status — can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. 
 
"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand – new people, new families," Guttridge says. "We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn." He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming – and how tasty its produce can be. 
 
Win, win, win
 
Nutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. 
 
Amy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. "It's a triple win," she explains. "It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy," she explains. 
 
Then again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.

He argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. 
 
"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn – they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables," Krieger says. 
 
Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. 
 
Instead of sticks, they're using carrots – trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. 
 
A force for good
 
Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery. 
 
Mackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. "A lot of storage crops in here right now," she says. 
 


 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.
 
 




Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. "We have a large Nepalese community here," she says. "So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about – will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?" 
 
Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. "I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here," she says. 
 
Yes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. 
 
"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool," she says. "And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently." 
Policy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident — so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.
