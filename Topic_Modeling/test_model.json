        "excerpt": "Daniel Cormier says UFC 300 is \"missing a big fight.\" What could be bigger than the Conor McGregor vs. Nate Diaz trilogy?",
        "summary": "Daniel Cormier believes there's an even bigger fight for Conor McGregor's return that would make for a perfect UFC 300 headliner.\nMcGregor (22-6 MMA, 10-4 UFC) is expected to meet Michael Chandler in his comeback fight, but an official date has yet to be set. UFC 300 is starting to shape up nicely but is still without a main event. A rematch between welterweight champion Leon Edwards and Belal Muhammad has been linked to UFC 300, but Cormier doesn't see it as a big enough fight to headline the milestone event April 13 in Las Vegas.\n'What I will say about UFC 300, it's missing a big fight,' Cormier said on 'DC & RC.' 'That big fight that it's missing has to have a backstory. That big fight has to have bad blood. That big fight has to bring the eyeballs. So, it can't be Belal Muhammad and Leon Edwards because it just doesn't have enough to it. While it's a fantastic fight, it doesn't have enough to it for it to be the main event.'\nCormier believes McGregor, the sport's biggest star, should headline UFC 300.  posted an image of him face to face with McGregor in the octagon, hinting that he's ready to settle their trilogy. With the pair splitting their two previous bouts, Cormier sees a rubber match as a fight that would generate the biggest audience for UFC 300.\n'Regardless of who he would fight, the attraction comes with him,' Cormier said. 'But if McGregor fights Diaz, that is what I believe draws the general fan in as much as anything that they could do in the UFC right now \u2013 just because of  and the intrigue, the way the first fight played out, the way the second fight played out. It is still two of the highest-grossing pay-per-views in UFC history.\n'These two men, when you put them together, make a lot of money, and it is far enough out there to be considered an attraction. I also believe at this point in their careers, sure,  isn't the guy that he was before. He's not the guy that fought the most beautiful striking exhibit against Michael Johnson in Florida, where he went and (said), \u2018Conor McGregor, you're taking everything I worked for.' He's not that same guy, but neither is Conor McGregor.'\nDiaz hasn't competed in an MMA fight since his September 2022 win over Tony Ferguson, which was the last fight on his UFC contract. Even though he departed, UFC CEO Dana White has kept the door open for a possible future return. Since leaving the UFC, Diaz competed in a boxing match last September against Jake Paul, which he lost by unanimous decision.\nMcGregor hasn't fought since July 2021, when he broke his leg during an injury TKO loss to Dustin Poirier in their trilogy.\nFor  on the card, visit MMA Junkie's event hub for\u00a0UFC 300.\nMMA: UFC 196-McGregor vs Diaz\nMarch 5, 2016; Las Vegas, NV, USA;  (right) against Conor McGregor during UFC 196\u2026\nMarch 5, 2016; Las Vegas, NV, USA;  (right) against Conor McGregor during UFC 196 at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS \u2013 As the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs compete for the national championship on Sunday, they will be doing so while history is being made.\nSuper Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will be the first NFL championship game to be completely powered by solar energy in the game's nearly 60-year history.\nAllegiant Stadium officials announced in October that the stadium had converted to 100% renewable energy, becoming the first NFL stadium completely powered by it.\nThis power is produced in collaboration with Nevada power company NV Energy.\nWhile the company produces energy from a number of renewable resources, NV Energy spokesperson Meghin Delaney noted that the type of energy that will be powering Allegiant Stadium during the Super Bowl is solar.\n\n\"Solar is the biggest part of our renewable portfolio,\" she said. \"We live in Las Vegas. We serve the whole state. We get 300 days of sunshine. So we have a lot of solar fields that make up our renewable portfolio.\"\nThe energy used to power Allegiant Stadium is generated at a solar farm located about an hour northeast of the stadium in the Moapa Indian Reservation, according to Delaney. Called Arrow Canyon Solar and Storage, the solar farm has 621,000 panels and 500 battery units.\nThe solar farm is then connected to the main electric grid, where the stadium draws its power. Delaney noted that, as part of a 25-year agreement between NV Energy and Allegiant Stadium, power for the stadium is coming specifically from the solar field.\nIn addition to pulling solar power from the grid, the stadium also has a 75-megawatt battery storage system onsite that holds a five-hour charge.\n\"During the day when those solar panels are taking in the sunlight, it'll charge up that battery,\" Delaney said. \"And then, when the sun goes down, those panels aren't producing energy anymore, then we can discharge that battery for five hours.\"\nWhile Allegiant Stadium's power source differs from other stadiums, Delaney said Super Bowl attendees on Sunday will not notice a difference in their game-viewing experience. Using a renewable energy source is just one part of stadium officials' overall sustainability plan.\n\nOutside of the stadium, the energy produced by the solar farm also powers many Las Vegas homes. According to Delaney, the 621,000 panels at the farm produce enough energy to power nearly 60,000 NV Energy customers.\n\"It's just great for the stadium. It's also great for the community, and it's great for the environment,\" she said. \"So it's a win-win-win all around.\"\nShe added that the solar farm also powers NV Energy customers on the Las Vegas Strip.",

        "summary": "Las Vegas is known for its larger-than-life atmosphere, premier entertainment, rowdy clubs, and, of course, stellar dining scene. From flashy steakhouses to celebrity-owned eateries, there are plenty of renowned restaurants to explore when visiting Sin City. Even though Nevada is landlocked, you'll still find high-end seafood on every corner. That said, if a craving for sushi strikes, you're in luck. Whether you're planning a special outing for an anniversary or birthday or simply want innovative rolls made with quality fish, there is something for every kind of sushi lover.\nThough many of the most popular restaurants in Las Vegas are located on the Strip in some of the most iconic hotels, you'll also find a vibrant and bustling food scene in the more locally-loved downtown area.

This list was compiled using a combination of personal experience, local expertise, and professional reviews.\nRead more: 15 Different Ways To Cook Fish\nNobu is an iconic restaurant group with locations all over the world. Nobu Restaurant Las Vegas, located in Caesars Palace, maintains Chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature style: a sleek interior with neutral tones and Japanese-inspired decor. Though Nobu has a slew of cooked dishes that are quite famous, such as the Wagyu tacos or black cod with miso, the sushi truly is the star of the show. From nigiri to sashimi, Nobu uses the highest quality fish to ensure freshness and premium flavor, even in the simplest creations. However, the signature sushi dishes are where it's at.\nThe sashimi salad with Matsuhisa dressing is a wonderful appetizer that is zesty and savory, while the crispy rice with tuna is a beloved dish that never gets old. The toro carpaccio with seasonal truffles is beyond decadent, but you can also opt for the omakase experience if you want a true taste of all that this legendary establishment has to offer.\n\n(866) 733-5827\n3570 Las Vegas Blvd S, Las Vegas, NV 89109\nKaiseki Yuzu, the brainchild of\u00a0Chef Kaoru Azeuchi, is a staple for Las Vegas locals looking for high-quality sushi that is consistently delicious. The Kaiseki menu changes every month, so even if you're a loyal regular, you can try something new each time you visit. There are three different Kaiseki menus to choose from, with the 10-course monthly special being the most opulent. However, if you're interested in sticking with sushi and not exploring more unique dishes, book a seat at the sushi bar for the omakase experience.\nThe experience includes seven Osaka-style sushi omakase courses, with one course being 10 different pieces of chef's choice sushi. Since there are only six spaces at the sushi bar, expect a private and intimate dinner that will have you entirely focused on the flavors and quality of each piece of fish.\n\n(702) 778-8889\n3900 Spring Mountain Rd #A5, Las Vegas, NV 89102\nDespite its simple and low-key atmosphere, Yui Edomae serves up killer sushi in an unassuming part of Las Vegas. Patrons are treated to the best of the best when it comes to sushi, including with ingredients originating from Japan. Nothing beats a crisp Sapparo while enjoying sushi, but you can also sip on champagne, wine, or sake at Yui Edomae. There are three different omakase menus to choose from, with the deluxe omakase dinner, complete with a sake or wine pairing, being the most exclusive.\nIn addition to a sashimi platter and an array of Edomae nigiri, this experience also includes soup, a charcoal grilled platter, dessert, and more. Since this is a more formal and elevated dining experience, reservations are a must, and you should do your best to plan in advance. Any sushi lover is guaranteed a great eating experience here.\n\n(702) 202-2408\n3460 Arville St HS, Las Vegas, NV 89102\nGet ready to make a reservation at one of the most coveted sushi experiences off the Strip. The minimalistic yet elegant interior creates a calm and aesthetic ambiance as patrons prepare to enjoy a chef-driven Edomae sushi dinner. Reservations are a must at this establishment, so plan accordingly and don't expect to be able to just walk in on a whim. The fish is obviously the most important part of the process, and the majority of the ones used at Kabuto Edomae Sushi are flown in from Japan.\nSake is another key component of the meal, and each bottle is carefully selected to pair perfectly. The sushi menu changes daily, so diners will enjoy innovative, novel plates every time. This element of surprise also adds charm to the coursed experience, and while you may not know what sushi you'll be trying, you can rest easy knowing that you'll leave both impressed and satisfied.\n\n(725) 205-1356\n5040 W Spring Mountain Rd #4, Las Vegas, NV 89146\nWAKUDA is a bold and cool Japanese restaurant located at The Palazzo at The Venetian Resort. Vibrant florals, neon decor, and loud artwork create a busy and urban ambiance that is quite unique compared to most sushi restaurants. Sip on sake, wine, or craft cocktails while you admire the dining room before ordering some oysters, spicy tuna crispy rice, and kanpachi carpaccio for the table. If you have any vegetarian diners in your group, the avocado carpaccio with ponzu and red yuzu kosho is a great pick, too.\nThe Japanese A5 Wagyu roll is a favorite among carnivores, but classic sushi lovers will gravitate toward the fresh selection of sashimi and nigiri. That said, the lobster roll with chili butter ponzu is the definition of decadent, and it's exactly what you'll want to splurge on while in Las Vegas.\n\n(702) 665-8592\n3325 S Las Vegas Blvd Las Vegas, NV 89109\nNothing beats an upscale sushi dinner at the timeless Bellagio Hotel and Casino. The tall windows at Yellowtail Japanese Restaurant & Lounge look right out onto the iconic fountains, giving patrons a great view of the show while they indulge in some of the best sushi on the Strip. Though you can order\u00a0\u00e0 la carte, the $180 omakase menu is the best way to get a true taste of what this masterful establishment has to offer. Take things to the next level with the $60 sake pairing -- we can assure you it's well worth the price.\nIf you prefer to build your perfect dinner yourself, kick things off with the toro caviar, lobster carpaccio, and tuna tataki. When it comes to specialty rolls, the Angry Salmon has the ideal amount of spice, as does the Popping Spicy Crab. Those hoping to add some hot dishes should also order the rock shrimp and braised Wagyu short ribs.\n\n(702) 730-3900\n3600 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109\nWhether you're in the mood for a chef-driven sushi sampler or simply want to sit down for a glass of white wine and fresh nigiri, Soho Japanese Restaurant is a favorite for locals in Concorde Plaza. Its unassuming location has allowed it to fly under the radar, but true sushi lovers in the area know that the consistency and quality at Soho Japanese Restaurant rivals even some of the fanciest spots on the Strip.\nThe hamachi with serrano and yuzu is a wonderful starter, as is the escolar carpaccio with Italian seasoning and white ponzu. The Tanjun is a seven-piece plate of nigiri that is chosen by the chef, while the Tokubetsu features 21 pieces of chef's choice sashimi. However, you can't come to Soho Japanese Restaurant without ordering the deep-fried Firecracker Roll and the fresh Paradise Roll.\n\n(702) 776-7778\n7377 S Jones Blvd Ste 116, Las Vegas, NV 89139\nMorimoto, located in the MGM Grand, is the ideal place for a modern and chic Japanese dinner. The abstract and geometric walls create an artsy ambiance that has a futuristic feel, while the black-and-white photos by Yasumichi Morita behind the sushi bar offer a more nature-inspired scene. Before diving into the sushi, start with some legendary items from the cold appetizers. From the hamachi tacos to the anchovy aioli-topped tuna pizza, there are some truly special creations to try and indulge in.\nThe Morimoto specialty rolls also shouldn't be skipped, with the tiger roll being a fan favorite. Even the classic California roll is made with real snow crab, which shows the restaurant's attention to quality ingredients. You can also enjoy some teppanyaki, a Japanese hibachi, where you can watch the chefs masterfully cook in front of you.\n\n(702) 891-3001\n3799 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109\nSushi Roku is a beloved sushi restaurant that has four locations in California and one in Las Vegas. The interior is chic and modern, boasting tall windows that let in an ample amount of natural light during the day. Start with sake or a bottle of wine before diving into a hearty array of appetizers. Like most sushi and robata restaurants, the dishes at Sushi Roku are designed to be shared, so it's best to order several dishes for the table.\nThere are several different crudos and carpaccios that shouldn't be skipped, but the seared albacore with crispy onions and ponzu is a top pick. Meanwhile, the White Lotus is a signature roll that is topped with a rich and flavorful wasabi truffle soy sauce. You can't go wrong with the baked crab handroll from Sushki Roku, either.\n\n(702) 733-7373\n3500 S Las Vegas Bvld, Las Vegas, NV 89109\nCATCH is an upscale seafood restaurant with Instagram-worthy decor. In addition to sushi, you'll also find a variety of steaks and cooked dishes on the menu, but the raw dishes always manage to steal the show. Some can't-miss cold starters include the truffle sashimi with tuna and hamachi and the rainbow sashimi salad with zesty ginger and a sesame vinaigrette. The tartare trio is also a favorite on Instagram and comes with a side of wasabi cr\u00e8me fra\u00eeche. When it comes to rolls, don't miss out on the simple yet delicious hand rolls, which can also be turned into cut rolls.\nMore innovative and complex rolls like the Hellfire Roll come with spicy tuna two ways, pear, and balsamic. However, the decadent Wagyu surf and turf roll with Maine lobster, crispy potato, truffle aioli, sweet ponzu, chimichurri, and tempura flakes is unlike any other.\n\n(702) 590-5757\n3730 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89158\nSUSHISAMBA serves up some of the best Japanese and Latin American fusion cuisine in Las Vegas. If you love bold flavors and a little bit of spice, this is sure to become one of your go-to spots. Located within The Venetian, the curved architecture and grandiose atmosphere set the scene for a hip night out on the town, and the stiff cocktails are exactly what you need to get your night started. Start with a classic Brazilian Caipirinha or the Samba Sour -- a contemporary take on the Pisco Sour. Meanwhile, the Wasabi Margarita is a spicy favorite that is the epitome of Japanese and Latin fusion.\nThere are also plenty of options when it comes to rolls. The Samba Strip is a lobster-focused roll that is wrapped in soy paper, while the El Topo is a one-of-a-kind creation that uses shiso leaf, melted mozzarella, salmon, spicy mayo, and more.\n\n(702) 607-0700\n3327 S Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109\nWhether you're staying at The Wynn Las Vegas or are a local planning dinner for a special occasion, Mizumi is a must-visit. The chic and design-forward space sets the scene for a romantic evening on the Strip. If you can't score a table, the sushi bar makes for a fun and more interactive experience as you watch the masterful chefs prepare your meal right in front of you. There is also a teppanyaki room for hibachi lovers.\nThough you can't go wrong with a customized selection of nigiri, Mizumi's specialty sushi items shouldn't be overlooked. The scallop tataki and crispy shrimp roll are a unique blend of textures and flavors that manage to work perfectly together. The baked king crab roll is a sushi classic that is decadent and rich, but it doesn't get more luxe than the Wagyu beef and lobster roll.\n\n(702) 770-3320\n3131 Las Vegas Blvd, Las Vegas, NV 89109\nThose seeking a fancy, elevated, and memorable sushi experience off the Strip should look no further than Kame Omakase. Reservations are a must here, so you'll definitely need to plan your visit ahead of time. The modern space features Japanese-style architecture with minimal decor, and patrons are able to sit at tables or at the sushi bar. Considering omakase is literally in the name, that's exactly what you can expect during your dinner. The coursed experience remains loyal to traditional omakase, and each dish is hand-crafted by the executive chef.\nThe premium omakase menu costs $350 per person, while the signature omakase costs $500 per person. Each dish is plated beautifully, and though there is plenty of sushi to explore, you'll also be treated to a variety of cooked and cured dishes at this intimate spot.\n\n(702) 771-0122\n3616 W Spring Mountain Rd Ste 103, Las Vegas, NV 89102\nIf you love burgers and sushi, Jjanga Steak & Sushi offers the best of both worlds. Though the rolls cater to a variety of preferences, the sushi sliders are one-of-a-kind. The buns are made out of crispy rice and can be filled with everything from spicy tuna to crab and seaweed salad. Rich sauces like spicy mayo and eel sauce give it plenty of flavor, resulting in a new kind of burger that is perfect for seafood lovers. That said, the all-you-can-eat sushi deal is one of the biggest draws for locals and runs every day from 11:30 a.m. to 2:00 a.m.\nOther menu highlights include the sushi burritos. However, if you prefer to stick with rolls, the Joe Special and surf and turf rolls are both popular options. The hibachi selection is also worth exploring if you are looking for that type of dining experience.\n\n(702) 914-8821\n6125 S Fort Apache Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89148\nLooking for a laidback sushi restaurant with quality rolls and fresh fish?

Of course, ordering a few rolls is always a good idea.\nThe tempura rolls are quite filling and hearty, but the signature rolls utilize unique flavor combos and ingredients like deep-fried crab, seared red snapper, and house-made sauces. Given its unassuming exterior and low-key location, the level of quality that patrons find at Sakana Sushi is a pleasant surprise, and the fair prices will certainly have you coming back for more.\n\n(725) 258-6684\n3949 S Maryland Pkwy, Las Vegas, NV 89119\nEach restaurant included in this list was selected based on first-hand experience, local recommendations, and published reviews.

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2014 A powerful winter storm that dumped more than 2 feet of snow within 24 hours in the mountains surrounding the Las Vegas valley created some dangerous conditions, including an avalanche at Lee Canyon.\nLee Canyon is reporting blizzard conditions for Tuesday and Wednesday and remains closed, possibly through Wednesday, following the avalanche. Another foot of snow is expected to fall. The county is advising the public to not travel to the Mt. Charleston area.\nBoth State Route 156 (Lee Canyon Road) and State Route 158 (Deer Creek Road) are closed to all traffic, for snow operations, according to Nevada State Police. State Route 157 (Kyle Canyon Road) is closed past the SR 158 junction, except to residents, and chains or snow tires are required.\nMore than 460 NV Energy customers on the mountain have been without power since around 10:30 p.m. Monday. NV Energy is working to assess the damage and make repairs. The power company estimates the power will be restored around 4 p.m. Tuesday.\nThe avalanche occurred around 1:20 p.m. at Lee Canyon Ski Area above the Sherwood chairlift, affecting the Black Jack, High Roller, and Keno trails. Four hikers reported missing after the avalanche were found safe. However, Nevada Task Force 1 search and rescue teams plan to use dogs Tuesday as a precaution to ensure no unreported person is missing.\nThe winter storm warning remains in effect for the Spring Mountains and Sheep Mountains until 10 p.m. Tuesday.\nThe humidity level in the Las Vegas valley is at 93%. According to the National Weather Service, that moisture is fueling more rain and snow through Tuesday evening. 'These showers will bring an increased risk for flooding and possibly even a rumble of thunder,' the weather service reported.\nThe rain total set a daily record on Monday at .37\u2033 but northwest Las Vegas near Skye Canyon received .83\u2033. The normal annual rainfall for Las Vegas is 4.19\u2033.",

Steven Horsford (NV-04) and Eric Morrissette, Interim Under Secretary of Commerce for Minority Business Development Agency (MBDA), for a visit to The Chef Jeff Project. Founded by Chef Jeff Henderson, The Chef Jeff Project is a non-profit organization that teaches at-risk young people and those with prior involvement in the criminal justice system culinary and soft skills to help them secure employment.\nAt The Chef Jeff Project, the leaders discussed a forthcoming SBA rule that will remove restrictions on loan programs that currently prevent returning citizens, including those who are currently on parole and probation, from being eligible for loans. As part of that rule change, the SBA will also remove questions about criminal history from its loan applications. Under the Biden-Harris Administration, more Americans than ever are filing applications to start a new business, and this rule change will build on that historic momentum by providing a second chance to those seeking the American Dream of entrepreneurship.\nAdministrator Guzman then joined Second Gentleman Emhoff for visits to local Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander-owned small businesses, including World Wide Safety, Status Sparkling Wine, and Straight Up Caf\u00e9, to learn about the state of the AAPI-owned small business landscape under this Administration. The leaders heard from the small business owners about their entrepreneurial journeys and highlighted the Biden-Harris Administration's Small Business Boom, which has seen 16 million new business applications filed since President Biden took office \u2013 including 185,000 in Nevada alone.\nFor follow-up interview requests for Administrator Guzman, please contact Rebecca Galanti at Rebecca.Galanti@sba.gov.\nEvent Photos:\u00a0\u00a0Photos available upon request at press_office@sba.gov\n###\u00a0\u00a0About the U.S. Small Business Administration\u00a0The U.S. Small Business Administration helps power the American dream of business ownership.

        "summary": "UFC flyweight champion Alexandre Pantoja thinks Steve Erceg's title shot is a case of timing.\nIt came as a surprise to many that Erceg wound up getting the next shot at Pantoja after notching just his third octagon win with a knockout of Matt Schnell at UFC Fight Night 238. He challenges Pantoja for the flyweight title in the UFC 301 headliner May 4 in Rio.\nWhile Pantoja (27-5 MMA, 11-3 UFC) also didn't foresee Erceg (12-1 MMA, 3-0 UFC) being his next opponent, he argued that everyone is talented in the top 15.\n'I didn't expect it to be Steve Erceg, but it's a good name, too,' Pantoja told MMA Junkie. 'That's funny because if you watch my interviews, all the time I was talking about in the flyweight division, you can take someone from No. 10 and fight with the champion or the No. 1 contender, and it's going to be a good matchup. In this division, all the guys are so good.'\nPantoja also didn't have too many fresh matchups as options. Erceg threw his name in the hat in an interview with MMA Junkie, and Muhammad Mokaev and Brandon Royval also campaigned.\n'I fought with all the division,' Pantoja said. 'I fought with the No. 1 (Royval) two times, the No. 2 (Moreno) three times, No. 3 right now is Amir Albazi, who has an injury. I fought Kai Kara-France before, Manel Kape, Alex Perez, Matt Schnell, I fought everyone. I think that guy is so lucky because all these things happened.'\nPantoja is motivated by the fact that Erceg hasn't had to go through the trenches to get to him.\n'He's coming fresh for that fight because he didn't fight the No. 8 or No. 6 or No. 4 like me,' Pantoja said. 'I needed to fight with all these guys, and I had a lot of wars with Manel Kape, Brandon Moreno, Brandon Royval, that gives me a lot of emotion.\n'I lost a couple of years of my life in those fights, and that guy Steve comes so fresh. He didn't fight the guys at the top of the division. All the fighters in the flyweight division are very good. He has good boxing, good jiu-jitsu, it's going to be very interesting for me.'\nAs for undefeated Mokaev, who notched a win over former title challenger Alex Perez at UFC Fight Night 238, Pantoja expects to see him very soon.\n'I really thought at that time I'd fight with Mokaev, but I don't know what plans the UFC prepared for me,' Pantoja admitted. 'Maybe they want Mokaev to fight with Royval first. It's going to be a very good matchup.\n'Also, Mokaev is so young. He has a chance to prove he deserves to fight for the title. I know 100 percent if I defend my belt in Brazil, I'm going to see Mokaev next.'\nFor  on the card, visit MMA Junkie's event hub for\u00a0UFC 301.\nalexandre-pantoja-ufc-290-media-day\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nalexandre-pantoja-ufc-290-media-day-1\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nbrandon-no-ufc-290-media-day\nBrandon Moreno\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nAlexandre pantoja ufc 290 presser\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nbrandon-no-ufc-290-pre-fight-press-conference\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nAP UFC 290 MIXED MARTIAL ARTS S MMA USA NV\nBrandon Moreno reacts during a news conference for the UFC 290 Mixed Martial arts event Thursday,\u2026\nBrandon Moreno reacts during a news conference for the UFC 290 Mixed Martial arts event Thursday, July 6, 2023, in Las Vegas.

'They want u to die before u get out these contracts it's up to u to make something pop no one gonna help you but you Free Conor it's at pattys day in this b*tch.'\nDiaz's comments refer to McGregor's continued public calls for a UFC return while doing media rounds for his upcoming film 'Road House.' While McGregor has expressed interest in fighting, UFC CEO Dana White has repeatedly indicated McGregor's wealth and the film have gotten in the way.\nThis was me for years before Conor even got here they want u to die before u get out these contracts it's up to u to make something pop no one gonna help you but youFree Conor it's at pattys day in this bitch \u2618\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/X4WQVNV79X\n\u2014 Nathan Diaz (@NateDiaz209) March 17, 2024\nMcGregor, 35, has not competed since a July 2021 leg break suffered in a fight vs. Dustin Poirier. He underwent extensive rehabilitation and removed himself from the UFC's anti-doping testing pool. McGregor reentered the pool in October, with the promotion indicating he'd need to undergo six months of testing before his return.\nDiaz, 38, became a free agent in November 2022. He boxed Jake Paul in August and lost a decision. He'll return for another boxing match on June 1, this time vs. former UFC opponent Jorge Masvidal.\nclay-guida-nate-diaz-ufc-94-5\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nnate-diaz-13.jpg\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nUS PRESSWIRE Sports\nDec. 30, 2011; Las Vegas, NV, USA; UFC fighter  (left) talks with UFC president\u2026\nDec. 30, 2011; Las Vegas, NV, USA; UFC fighter  (left) talks with UFC president Dana White after winning a lightweight bout at UFC 141 at the MGM Grand Garden event center.

Vanessa Porter said.\nWhen found, it was visible that one of Angelina's arms had a possible partial amputation as one of her arms had a protrusion of a small nub. Due to the skin not adequately covering the nub, she is very susceptible to infections, growing abscesses, and pain.\nBeing taken in by Homeward Bound gave this little tabby a new shot at life. Homeward Bound Cat Adoptions is a free-roaming center that allows people and cats to truly connect and creates a better atmosphere for adoption.\nAngelina is currently being housed in a supportive foster home.\n'She is surrounded by love, and her foster family includes a tiny human who has become her biggest supporter. She is cuddly, playful, and lives her life to the fullest. We know that once she has the surgery, she will be even happier!' Porter said.\nTo prevent this youthful tabby from suffering any further, Homeward is asking for donations to help with the estimated $1,000 amputation surgery cost for Angelina.\nIf you would like to support Angelina on her journey to a new healthy life, there are 3 ways to make a tax-deductible donation:\nOnline: Use this link and put Angelina's name in the comment field\nMail: 2675 East Flamingo Road, Suite 3, Las Vegas, NV 89121\nIn-person: Tuesdays \u2013 Sundays, 12 pm to 6 pm (same address as above)\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KLAS.",

        "summary": "Daniel Rodimer, the disgraced GOP congressional candidate who was endorsed by Donald Trump despite a previous arrest for a Waffle House assault, is being sought by Las Vegas police in connection to a murder.\nRodimer, 45, is accused of murdering 47-year-old Christopher Tapp during an altercation inside a hotel room at the Hilton Resorts World on the Las Vegas strip on Oct. 29, police announced Wednesday.\nIn a statement, police said Tapp, of Idaho, died at a Vegas hospital from 'blunt force trauma to the head.' It said the incident was called in as an accident, but investigating detectives determined otherwise in the months that followed.\nA criminal complaint filed by the Clark County District Attorney's office alleged that Rodimer struck Tapp 'on the head,' adding that the slaying was 'willful, deliberate, and premeditated,' reported 3 .\nRodimer, a former wrestler who performed under the name Dan Rodman in the WWE, lost his campaign to represent Nevada's 3rd Congressional District in 2020 against Rep. Susie Lee (D-NV). After that, he reportedly moved to Texas to launch another failed bid to make it into Congress\u2014where he was accused of using a phony Texas accent to try and win over voters.\nHis criminal past includes an arrest in 2011, when he was charged with misdemeanor battery for throwing a man to the floor at a Waffle House in Naples, Florida, that was not far from his law school, Ave Maria University.\nWitness statements reviewed by The Daily Beast revealed that Rodimer, who appeared to be drunk, explained at the scene that he loved to 'fuck' people up. That statement came shortly after he threw the man who confronted him about harassing diners in the restaurant.\nWitness: GOP Candidate Bragged He Liked to \u2018Fuck' People Up\n'When I asked him to leave the girls at our table alone and to please just move on, he grabbed me by the neck and threw me into a chair and onto the floor,' Rodimer's victim told police in a statement, which was backed up by others who spoke to police.\nBefore he left the Waffle House, Rodimer was said to have thrown down a business card with his name and face on it\u2014a clue police later used to identify him for the attack\u2014and then boasted about how much he liked 'hurting people,' a police report said.\n'As Dan was leaving the restaurant he was using profanity and stated how much he enjoys hurting people,' cops wrote.\nLas Vegas cops did not say what led to Rodimer and Tapp's violent encounter, nor did they say if the men knew each other. Tapp was wrongfully convicted of a 1996 murder in Idaho, which forced him to serve 20 years behind bars before he was exonerated by DNA evidence.\nA month prior to his slaying, Tapp recorded an interview with Dateline at his Idaho home, where he reportedly detailed his time behind bars for a crime he didn't commit. Before that show ever went to air, however, he died in a Vegas hospital, allegedly after being beaten in the head by Rodimer.",

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2013 NV Energy, in an effort to maintain its current level of customer service and employee morale, will raise its electric rates to pay for bonuses for some 1,200 members of its workforce.\nAt a meeting of the state Public Utilities Commission Tuesday, commissioners voted to allow the increase. NV Energy needed the Commission's approval because the company did not make enough profit for those bonuses \u2014 called cash performance awards \u2013 to automatically vest. Those bonuses go to employees at the management level and below, a spokeswoman for NV Energy told the 8  Now Investigators. High-level executives do not qualify for the award.\nBut the Commission's chairwoman, Hayley Williamson, said the rate hike would have a 'de minimis' impact on the average monthly electric bill in Southern Nevada. The average homeowner in the region would see an increase of 33 cents a month, the spokeswoman said.\nAt the meeting, during which a rate hike for Southwest Gas was also discussed, commissioners said failing to provide these cash award bonuses could have a negative impact on NV Energy's customer service.\n'Further reducing compensation has the potential to exacerbate poor customer service results rather than enhancing them,' Randy Brown, one of PUCN's three commissioners, said at the meeting. Brown said NV Energy's employees are under-compensated in the company's existing payment structure. Brown was appointed to the board by Republican Gov. Joe Lombardo in October 2023. The other two commissioners \u2013 Williamson and Tammy Cordova \u2013 were appointed to the commission by then-Gov. Steve Sisolak, a Democrat.\nSimilarly, the commissioners said receiving the bonuses could have an equally positive impact on NV Energy's customer service.\nNV Energy provided a statement, saying in full:\n'NV Energy works hard to attract, recruit, and retain a qualified, successful workforce to provide safe, affordable, and reliable power to our customers. Many costs are included in rates paid by customers, including the salary and benefits for NV Energy's workforce. That is not unlike other businesses \u2013 which also factor in employee salary and benefits to costs of goods and services. To ensure NV Energy can attract and retain talent, its salary and benefit programs provide a total compensation package that is at the median level of what an employee could receive at another company. All salary and benefit program costs proposed by NV Energy to be included in customer rates are validated through external benchmarking and reviewed and approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada.'\nIn January, NV Energy announced a separate hike, estimating that bills will go up about $2 for an average single-family residence.\nNV Energy's request to increase the basic service charge from $12.50 to $18.50 was approved by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada (PUCN) last year. That charge applies to residential customers.",

Photos obtained by\u00a0TMZ\u00a0show him stopping to pose for selfies with a couple of nearby police officers, possibly with a bottle of beer in hand, before heading into the eatery.\nFans were mixed in their reactions to the two consecutive Super Bowl winner continuing on with his plans for the day in the aftermath of the tragedy, with one replying to the publication's tweet sharing the article, \"Not a good look IMO for him a few hours after a person was killed and others wounded.\"\nSome else suggested he \"read the room\" while another called it the look \"really bad,\" however, most were quick to jump to his defense.\nOne user noted that they have \"no problem with him supporting first responders who were likely there today.\"\n\"A cop who probably had one of his worst days and kelces supposed to tell him no when he asks for a selfie?\" someone else asked. \"I hope travis made this cops day better.\"\nAnother agreed it was a \"classy move\" for Kelce to \"[give] time to [a] fan who is protecting him.\"\n\"...i'm sure if [he] had said no to the cop y'all would be mad too,\" someone else pointed out.\n\"What happened today was AWFUL and unforgivable! But, to want people to stop living life and letting those shooters win by stealing the joy from a team who worked hard on a goal and accomplished that goal just also isn't right,\" someone else wrote thoughtfully. \"Humans are complex creatures. We are capable of feeling a variety of emotions in any given time. We all handle things differently. To expect players or anyone to stop life and sit and home and do nothing but reflect on this tragedy, is just cruel, IMO.\"\nAnother encouraged anyone upset with the situation to turn to their politicians \"for not being able to deal with gun violence in the USA.,\" rather than the players, \"[as if\u00a0they] could possibly do something about this shooting.\"",

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS, NV (WVNS) \u2014 Is it a scripted Love Story or just coincidence?\nThe Kansas City Chiefs are set to take on the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LVIII at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sunday, February 11, 2024. This football season has been looked at closer than those of the past, with many fans saying the league and results are scripted.\nBeginning during the 2024 playoffs, a lot of fans turned to the colors of the Super Bowl LVIII logo because of a viral tweet. The tweet, viewed more than 8.9 million times, showed the logos of Super Bowl LVI, Super Bowl LVII, and Super Bowl LVIII, along with the two participating teams from each game.\nFollowing Taylor's lead, Travis Kelce says he needs to \u2018bring home some hardware'\nWith the colors of the this year's Super Bowl LVIII logo being red and purple, countless bets were placed on the Baltimore Ravens to take on the San Francisco 49ers. This did not happen.\nThe 49ers would win their matchup against the Detroit Lions; however, the Baltimore Ravens would lose to the Kansas City Chiefs. This result would set the course for yet another NFL conspiracy theory to take center stage.\nMany were quick to point out some close connections in this Swift-filled Super Bowl showdown thanks to Barstool  personality and Bussin' With The Boys host Taylor Lewan. While they may be just coincidences, there are a few close relations when it comes to Taylor Swift and Super Bowl LVIII.\nFor starters, Taylor Swift has openly spoken about the number '13' being her lucky number. The San Francisco 49ers will take on the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVII (58). With that basis of information, take a look at the below list of coincidences between Swift's lucky number and this year's Super Bowl.\nThis will be Super Bowl 58. If you add five and eight together, you get 13.\nSan Francisco 49ers are playing in the game. Four and nine added together equals 13.\nThe 49ers are the 1 seed in the NFC, while the Chiefs are the 3 seed in the AFC.\nTaylor Swift is scheduled to take a plane from her concert in Tokyo, Japan to Las Vegas, Nevada. While not exact, the flight time from Tokyo to Las Vegas is roughly 13 hours.\nIf Swift does indeed make it to the game, this will be her 13th appearance at a Kansas City Chiefs game this season.\nThe date for the Super Bowl is February 11, 2024. Two and 11 added together equals 13.\nIf you subtract 13 from 100, you get 87, which is the jersey number of Swift's boyfriend and Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce.\n\nWhile conspiracies are farfetched and should not drive anyone to make rash decisions, it is interesting to see how polarizing Taylor Swift's affect has been on the NFL as a whole this season. Could it be because a conspiracy is at play, or simply because of her big Reputation? That's for you to decided.",

How will they follow up last year's incredible Final Four run?\nIt's been a very different season for the Owls. Despite coach Dusty May returning a lot of last year's team, including leading scorer Johnell Davis and 7-foot-1 center Vladislav Goldin, FAU has lost twice as many games as they did heading into March Madness last year. That said, they're still a robust 24-7 (14-4 in AAC) and enter conference championship week comfortably in the tournament, according to bracket experts.\nHeading into the American Athletic Conference Tournament, FAU is No. 34 in NET ranking and 2-2 in Quad 1 games, the ones that weigh heaviest in March Madness seeding. The Owls' biggest win of the season came in a double-overtime thriller against No. 7 Arizona, but they're not the top seed in the their new conference because of a February road loss to in-state rival USF.\n\nLooking ahead to the NCAA Tournament, bracketologists are putting FAU around the same No. 9 seed that they were last season. Bracketville has FAU as the No. 9 seed in the East Region and taking on No. 8 Northwestern in the first round.

The flights must be booked using the promotion code 'SPRING' on the Breeze app or at flybreeze.com.\nThe start-up airline started flying out of Bradley in 2021 and now has 15 non-stop destinations from Bradley, Connecticut largest commercial airport. Another five routes are expected in May. The coast-to-coast route is to Phoenix, AZ.\nAvelo adds three destinations from Tweed, two west of the Mississippi. See where you can go.\nThe nonstop destinations, according to Bradley's web site, are: Charleston, SC; Columbus, OH; Fort Myers, FL; Jacksonville, FL; Las Vegas, NV; New Orleans, LA; Norfolk, VA; Phoenix, AZ; Raleigh-Durham, NC; Pittsburgh, PA; Richmond, VA; Sarasota-Bradenton, FL; Savannah, GA; Tampa, FL; and Vero Beach, FL. (The New Orleans route is seasonal.)\nIn addition, non-stop flights coming in May are Cincinnati, OH; Greenville-Spartanburg, NC; Myrtle Beach, SC; New Bern, SC and Orlando, FL\nBreeze said the sale was timed to the Spring Equinox, which took place on Tuesday, the time of the year when both of the Earth's hemispheres receive an equal amount of sunlight. This point in the spring, Breeze noted, also sees a shift from 'north-to-south' travel to 'east-to-west' bookings.\nThere are some considerations in the sale. Supply of tickets is limited, and certain dates may not be offered. Fare prices, fare classes, rules, routes and schedules are subject to change or exemption without notice. The 34% sale cannot be combined with other promotions.\nBase fares can increase with the number of checked bags, carry-ons and other services.\nKenneth R.

        "excerpt": "This year, the Super Bowl host Allegiant Stadium is combatting carbon emissions by being fully reliant on renewable energy.",
        "summary": "This year's Super Bowl will be the first one fully powered by renewable energy, thanks to the host stadium's agreement with a solar farm, reports say.\nMore than 621,000 solar panels found in a barren area of the Nevada desert help power the Allegiant Stadium, home to the Las Vegas Raiders and host of Super Bowl LVIII, reports several media outlets.\nAccording to the stadium's website, it's 100% \"powered by by Nevada-sourced renewable energy.\"\nAccording to CBS News, the Les Vegas stadium entered into a 25-year agreement with NV Energy to buy power from its new solar installation.\nDoug Cannon, CEO of NV Energy, told CBS the solar panel installation produces enough to power 60,000 homes.\nFor an event like the Super Bowl, the solar panels must produce 10 megawatts, which is enough to power 46,000 homes.\nAccording to the US Energy Information Administration, over 20% of the U.S.'s electricity came from renewable energy in 2022.\nSolar power is very dependent on sunlight. So, it may not be the best option for cities with little sunlight. However, Forbes reports that some of the best solar panels can still be energy efficient despite constant cloudy days.\nLuckily, the Nevada desert gets sunlight about 300 days a year.\n\"People sometimes get nervous about renewable power because they're not sure if it's going to be reliable,\" said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who inspected the stadium's main electrical entry room, reports CBS News. \"The fact that renewable power can power a facility like this reliably should speak volumes about what could happen in other communities.\"\nThe stadium has also implemented other sustainability initiatives.\n\"Sustainability was top of mind during the construction process of Allegiant Stadium,\" says the stadium's website.\nAccording to the webpage, its roof, which is made from ethylene tetrafluoroethylene, or ETFE, a recyclable plastic material that provides climate adaptability, insulation performance, self-cleaning, and a long lifespan, is one of its more energy-efficient features.\nIt also has a way of taking care of food scraps so they don't end up in landfills.\nThe website states that it collects an average of 12,000 pounds of kitchen cuttings and food scraps after each event. It then donates them to local live stock farms and used to feed the animals.\nThis isn't the first time a host stadium tries to curb the amount of waste it produces.\nIn 2020, the last time the Kansas City Chiefs faced the San Francisco 49ers in Miami, the Hard Rock Stadium tried to go zero waste by making sure all of its waste ended up at a recycling center, compost facility, or a plant where it was burned for energy, reports National Geographic.\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Super Bowl is the first ever to be fully powered by renewable energy",

BracketWAG.com has FAU as a No. 7 seed in the Midwest region facing No. 10-seed Texas in the first round. Bracketville put the Owls as the No. 6 seed in the East region, down from their projections last week. They have FAU facing No. 11 Indiana State in a first-round matchup in Pittsburgh. Bracketologists.com, which seeds teams strictly off NET rankings, has FAU as a 7-seed facing No. 10 Washington State to open the tournament.\nHere's a look at FAU's tournament r\u00e9sum\u00e9 as of Tuesday morning, as well as a look at national experts' March Madness projections:\nNET ranking:\u00a025\nKenPom ranking:\u00a024\nQuad 1 record:\u00a03-1\nQuad 2 record:\u00a03-1\nQuad 3 record:\u00a05-1\nQuad 4 record:\u00a07-1\nESPN's Joe Lunardi released his latest bracketology update Monday.

He has FAU as a No. 5 seed in the East region, playing in Brooklyn against the winner of a play-in game between Florida and St. John's. Last season, the Owls reached the Final Four by winning two games in Madison Square Garden in Manhattan.\nFlorida Atlantic takes a seven-game winning streak on the road to Birmingham, Alabama, to face UAB (14-8, 6-3 in AAC) at 9 p.m. Thursday. The game can be seen on ESPN2.\nAfter that, the Owls head to Wichita, Kansas, to take on Wichita State (9-13, 1-8) at noon Sunday, a game that can also be seen on ESPN2.

        "excerpt": "Photo Illustration by Erin O'Flynn/The Daily Beast/Getty Images and Elizabeth Helgelien/YouTubeA wild feud between a rising GOP star and her late ex-husband's mom erupted into public view on Wednesday\u2026",
        "summary": "A wild feud between a rising GOP star and her late ex-husband's mom erupted into public view on Wednesday when candidate Elizabeth Helgelien's infuriated former mother-in-law accused the MAGA-centric Nevada politician of being a liar and an adulterer.\nDaniel Halseth, Christine Halseth's son, was stabbed to death in 2021 by the couple's teenage daughter, Sierra Halseth, and her boyfriend, Aaron Guerrero. The pair are now serving life sentences.\nIn a scathing op-ed published Wednesday in The Nevada Globe, Halseth pleaded with Helgelien to drop out of the race for the state's 3rd Congressional District 'for my family's sake, and out of respect for voters and the office she's seeking.'\n'Elizabeth raised a murderer, was forced out of office after a series of sex scandals, was caught in a series of lies, posed for lewd photographs, and has already proven to be unelectable,' Halseth wrote. '... We cannot, in good conscience, allow Elizabeth Helgelien to represent honest, decent Americans in Congress.'\n'I don't care about the politics,' Christine Halseth told The Daily Beast on Thursday. 'I just want to stop her.'\nTrump Takes Home Double Win in Nevada and U.S. Virgin Islands' Caucuses\nHelgelien responded to a request for comment through political strategist Woodrow Johnson, who shared a tranche of materials and said in an email, 'Here are the facts that the documents we've attached verify: 1. Daniel Halseth is a convicted batterer. 2. The custody Judge expressed the belief that Sierra was experiencing abuse from Daniel Halseth and ordered sole custody to Elizabeth. 3. Daniel Halseth defied a court order, illegally detaining his daughter. 4. Sierra submitted a letter to the court stating that she was being abused, mentally, physically, and sexually by Daniel Halseth.'\nDaniel Halseth and Helgelien met as undergrads at Corban University, a private evangelical Christian school in Salem, Oregon. In Christine Halseth's piece in the Globe, she described Daniel as 'a loving father, an incredible musician, a talented photographer, and an avid outdoorsman.'\n'He should've turned 48 in January,' Halseth wrote.\nHelgelien threw her hat into the ring last week, and is now attempting to unseat Democratic Rep. Susie Lee, more than a decade after Helgelien left the Nevada State Senate under an adulterous cloud.\n'It's time for a Congress that carries the will of the real America, not ivory tower college professors and woke mega-corporations,' bellows Helgelien's campaign website, which features a photograph of the candidate toting an assault rifle. 'Elizabeth stands on the side of law and order against woke liberals who are comfortable watching our streets go to chaos as long as it makes them feel \u2018diverse' and \u2018inclusive.' Before any meaningful immigration reform can take place, we need to finish building the wall on our border.'\nShortly after midnight on Wednesday, Helgelien posted a picture on social media of herself with former President Trump, reading, 'A picture with President @realDonaldTrump (candidate Trump back then) before the polls closed at the Nevada caucus 2016. Proud supporter since day 1! I can't wait to see you back in the White House President Trump! I'm going to help deliver NV-03 for you!'\nHalseth sees her ex-daughter-in-law's campaign as an insult to her and her entire family, she wrote.\n'My son was married to Elizabeth for 11 years, and they had three children together,' Halseth's op-ed explained. 'Two decades ago, Elizabeth was seen as a rising star in local Republican politics. In 2010, she pulled off a major upset by knocking off an incumbent state senator to become the youngest Republican State Senator in Nevada history. Soon after, it all came crashing down.'\nThe two divorced after Daniel discovered his wife was having an affair with Tiger Helgelien, a onetime golf pro and realtor whose website Daniel, an IT expert, was helping build, Halseth said on Thursday, echoing existing reporting from Republican strategist Chuck Muth. While Elizabeth was conducting official business\u2014and sleeping with Tiger\u2014in the state capital of Carson City, Daniel was home taking care of their three young kids, Halseth wrote in her op-ed. There were rumors emerging of Elizabeth's infidelity, which Daniel confirmed when he was given a packet of opposition research compiled by a rival pol, Halseth told The Daily Beast. (Tiger Helgelien did not respond to a request for comment.)\nDaniel confronted Helgelien about the affair after a marriage counseling session, at their Las Vegas home\u2014while Tiger Helgelien was at the house, authorities said. The ensuing argument led to Daniel's arrest five days later on a charge of 'open and gross lewdness,' which, according to a police report, involved Daniel yanking his wife's pants down while demanding she 'fuck' him, shouting, 'What's he got that I don't have? Does he have a big cock? I'm your husband. I just want to know what I'm up against.' Daniel said he never touched Helgelien's genitals; he later pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor counts of coercion and battery, for which he received six months probation.\nA picture with President @realDonaldTrump (candidate Trump back then) before the polls closed at the Nevada caucus 2016.

John Ensign, a Nevada Republican, to resign over his own extramarital affair. During this same period, Helgelien was also caught fudging her own educational background, 'claiming she was pursuing an MBA when she didn't even have a bachelor's degree,' according to Halseth's op-ed.\n'When I met with the reporter who wrote the initial story, we spent some time talking about Corban University and the fact that I was taking a break and the fact that I planned to pursue an MBA,' Helgelien told the Las Vegas Sun in a 2011 email. 'I suppose I didn't clarify that the break was during the undergraduate work rather than during master's work. In hindsight, I regret that I both missed the story and didn't spend more time thinking about that conversation.'\nBut not only did Helgelien's 'apparently extensive infidelity tear her family apart\u2026 it also significantly affected her ability to do the job she was elected to do,' Halseth wrote in the Globe. She 'regularly missed crucial committee meetings and bill hearings,' the op-ed goes on, pointing out that then-Nevada Rep. Marilyn Kirkpatrick, a Democrat, said during a Legislative Commission meeting that she and others on the panel had been having 'a hard time reaching' Helgelien, the Las Vegas Sun reported at the time. Republican state Sen. Michael Roberson tried to smooth things over, saying Helgelien had 'things going on in her life that have necessitated her missing a lot of meetings,' according to the Sun.\n'After her regular absences during the legislature, failing the constituents she was elected to represent, and the public humiliation that came due to her cheating scandals, Elizabeth was forced to resign,' Halseth wrote on Wednesday.\nHelgelien subsequently married Tiger\u2014who majored in psychology at Corban U\u2014and posed for Maxim magazine's 2012 'Hot 100 List,' calling herself 'somebody who wants to make a real difference and for somebody who wants to truly serve and do the right thing.' The couple moved to Alaska, taking Helgelien's kids with them, and Daniel started fresh in Texas, according to Halseth. They returned to Las Vegas in 2018, and Helgelien tried to get back into politics, running once again for her old state senate seat. However, she finished third in the GOP primary, after which she and Tiger established their own real estate agency, called Simply Vegas.\n'I wish this were the end of the story, but unfortunately, it's just the tip of a tragic iceberg,' Halseth wrote in her op-ed.\nIn 2020, Daniel moved back to Las Vegas 'at the request of Sierra, the 16-year-old daughter he shared with Elizabeth,' the op-ed explains.\nThe following year, Daniel, 45, was murdered by Sierra and her 18-year-old boyfriend, Aaron. The pair stabbed him more than 70 times, then tried to dismember and torch the body, the Clark County Office of the Coroner/Medical Examiner determined.\n'Following the stabbings, they dismembered and burned my son's body, then bragged and laughed about the brutal killings on social media,' Halseth wrote.\nOn Thursday, she told The Daily Beast, 'I still can't read all the condolence cards. I have hundreds of cards. But not a word from Helgelien.'\nThe two were arrested in Utah, allegedly en route to California, and decided to kill Daniel over his opposition to the relationship, according to court records. But, on the day she was sentenced to life in prison, Sierra would float a brand-new motive for the murder. She said she had been abused by Daniel, a claim she had reportedly never mentioned previously, telling the judge that her 'biological father has traumatized me.'\nIn a video of an October 2020 court proceeding Woodrow Johnston shared with The Daily Beast, the judge said he got the sense that 'something else is going on with Sierra.'\n'I don't know yet what that is,' he said, 'whether that's parental alienation, whether that's human trafficking, whether that's manipulation. And I don't know who at this point is to blame for that.'\n'We believe Sierra,' Johnston said in an email on Friday morning.\nDefense attorney Michael Sanft later told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that he had not corroborated Sierra's claims. Helgelien told the paper that she believed her daughter, but that the 'system had failed' her. Christine Halseth, for her part, told the Review-Journal at the time that the claim was 'nothing but a lie,' which she emphasized again in her Wednesday op-ed.\n'Sierra never mentioned any abuse by her father, and all evidence indicated that Daniel was a caring and loving father,' Halseth wrote, quickly turning her ire back squarely on Halseth. '... There was no mention of my son, our family, or any remorse whatsoever after her daughter's unspeakable actions. There was also no mention that Elizabeth had primary custody of the child for years and clearly failed in her role as a mother. In other words, Elizabeth raised a murderer and now wants to be a member of Congress.'\nHalseth told The Daily Beast that she has not spoken to Sierra since Daniel's death. She said her other two grandchildren have also iced her out, and that she believes Helgelien is the one keeping them from having any contact with her.\nSanft and Guerrero's defense attorney, Gabriel Grasso, did not respond on Thursday to requests for comment.\nDaniel, Halseth said, 'just wanted the kids to be okay, and she used them like a pawn. It really is so sad. None of this should have happened. None of it.'\n'I have nothing to gain except to stop her,' Halseth said Thursday. 'Maybe someday, the kids will know the truth. She controlled the narrative. She's just a power-hungry narcissist\u2026 I don't want her in my life. But I had a choice: do I say something, or do I just let it go again? And I decided to say something.'",

        "summary": "Super Bowl\u00a02024 is setting the stage not just for a showdown between top NFL teams, but also for a major environmental milestone. This year, the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will host a Super Bowl powered entirely by renewable energy \u2014 a first in the history of the event.\nThe seemingly desolate area of the Nevada desert is the source of the green energy used to power the game.\nA vast solar farm with over 621,000 panels shimmers like a mirage but with the capability to power close to 60,000 residential customers \u2014 or one very big stadium.\nThe Las Vegas Raiders, which call Allegiant Stadium home, have entered into a 25-year agreement to buy power from this new solar installation owned by NV Energy.\nCEO Doug Cannon said that the solar installation would supply more than 10 megawatts of power for the Super Bowl. This amount of energy is roughly equivalent to the consumption of 46,000 homes.\nSustainability was front of mind as the stadium was being constructed, according to Raiders President Sandra Douglass Morgan.\nThe stadium's roof is made of a sustainable plastic material that allows in about 10% of daylight but blocks all solar heat, so it takes less energy to cool the building. The grass field is moved outdoors on a rail system to get natural sunlight rather than using energy-intensive growing lights. And everything from grass clippings to food scraps and cigarette butts are composted or converted into other forms of energy.\n\"When you come to a game you may be thinking about just focusing on the game but when they hear that and know that we're being conscious of our environmental footprint hopefully that guest will leave and have that same mindset when they go back home,\" said Douglass Morgan.\nThe Super Bowl's green energy push was highlighted during a visit from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who inspected the stadium's main electrical entry room.\n\"People sometimes get nervous about renewable power because they're not sure if it's going to be reliable. The fact that renewable power can power a facility like this reliably should speak volumes about what could happen in other communities,\" Granholm said.\nThe solar farm not only powers the current needs but also houses massive batteries to store renewable energy, ensuring a five-hour power supply even when the sun isn't shining. This technology is seen as a key component in transitioning the U.S. power grid toward 100% clean electricity by 2035, a goal set by President Biden.\nDespite the focus on environmental sustainability, the Super Bowl's entertainment, including a halftime show featuring performer Usher, will not be compromised.\n\"We have enough power for Usher and all of his lights and all the fanfare that'll be there,\" said Cannon.\nWatch the Super Bowl on\u00a0your local CBS station, on\u00a0Nickelodeon\u00a0and streaming on\u00a0Paramount+\u00a0on Sunday, Feb. 11.",

        "summary": "Grass or turf? Looking back at every  playing surface originally appeared on NBC  Bay Area\nEvery football player dreams of stepping onto a  field. Last year, however, the field did not reach a  standard.\nPlayers on both the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles struggled to keep their footing in  LVII. The game was played in Glendale, Ariz., on a natural grass playing surface that is rolled in and out of State Farm Stadium, which has a retractable roof. The slippery field prompted some Eagles players to change their cleats mid-game.\nNow, the  is headed to a new city that could face similar playing surface issues.\nLas Vegas will host its first  when the Chiefs go for a repeat against the San Francisco 49ers. Like State Farm Stadium, Allegiant Stadium is an indoor venue that rolls a natural grass surface in and out. While there hasn't been noticeable slipping, the stadium's Bermuda grass was in horrible shape the last time it hosted an NFL game between the Las Vegas Raiders and Denver Broncos in Week 18.\nThe 49ers are already experiencing field concerns in Las Vegas this week leading up to the game. NBC  Bay Area's Matt Maiocco reported that some 49ers shared safety concerns about their practice field on the UNLV campus, comparing it to a 'sponge.'\nDespite recent issues at the  and in Las Vegas, longtime groundskeeper George Toma, known as the 'Sodfather,' expects a much better playing surface this time around.\n'You'll see at Las Vegas now, they'll have the best playing field ever,' Toma told the Associated Press.\nBefore the Chiefs and 49ers run out onto the field on Sunday, let's look back at previous  playing surfaces.\n LVIII will be the 34th  played on grass and the fifth  to be played on grass indoors.\nThree of the prior s played on indoor grass were in Glendale (s XLII, XLIX and LVII). The only other one was at Houston's Reliant Stadium for  XXXVIII between the New England Patriots and Carolina Panthers.\nWhile the stadiums in Glendale and Houston have retractable roofs, Allegiant Stadium has a fixed, translucent roof.\nTwenty-four s have been played on turf.\nThe first 15 s to feature turf were played on either Poly-Turf or a variation of AstroTurf.  XL in Detroit was the first with a modern turf variant, as the Pittsburgh Steelers beat the Seattle Seahawks on Ford Field's FieldTurf surface. Since then, eight s have been played on either FieldTurf, Matrix Turf or other synthetic turf.\nOf the 24 turf s, 18 have been played indoors compared to six outside.  XLVIII between the Seahawks and Denver Broncos at Met Stadium was the most recent  to be played on turf outdoors.\nHere is a look at the playing surface for all 58 s:\n\n\nStadium\nLocation\nPlaying surface\nI\nChiefs vs. Packers\nMemorial Coliseum\nLos Angeles, Calif.\nGrass\nII\nPackers vs. Raiders\nOrange Bowl\nMiami, Fla.\nGrass\nIII\nJets vs. Colts\nOrange Bowl\nMiami, Fla.\nGrass\nIV\nVikings vs. Chiefs\nTulane Stadium\nNew Orleans, La.\nGrass\nV\nColts vs. Cowboys\nOrange Bowl\nMiami, Fla.\nPoly-Turf\nVI\nCowboys vs. Dolphins\nTulane Stadium\nNew Orleans, La.\nPoly-Turf\nVII\nDolphins vs. Washington\nMemorial Coliseum\nLos Angeles, Calif.\nGrass\nVIII\nVikings vs. Dolphins\nRice Stadium\nHouston, Texas\nAstroTurf\nIX\nSteelers vs. Vikings\nTulane Stadium\nNew Orleans, La.\nPoly-Turf\nX\nCowboys vs. Steelers\nOrange Bowl\nMiami, Fla.\nPoly-Turf\nXI\nRaiders vs. Vikings\nRose Bowl\nPasadena, Calif.\nGrass\nXII\nCowboys vs. Broncos\nLouisiana Superdome\nNew Orleans, La.\nMonsanto \"Mardi Grass\" turf\nXIII\nSteelers vs. Cowboys\nOrange Bowl\nMiami, Fla.\nGrass\nXIV\nRams vs. Steelers\nRose Bowl\nPasadena, Calif.\nGrass\nXV\nRaiders vs. Eagles\nLouisiana Superdome\nNew Orleans, La.\nMonsanto \"Mardi Grass\" turf\nXVI\n49ers vs. Bengals\nPontiac Silverdome\nPontiac, Mich.\nAstroTurf\nXVII\nDolphins vs. Washington\nRose Bowl\nPasadena, Calif.\nGrass\nXVIII\nWashington vs. Raiders\nTampa Stadium\nTampa, Fla.\nGrass\nXIX\nDolphins vs. 49ers\nStanford Stadium\nPalo Alto, Calif.\nGrass\nXX\nBears vs. Patriots\nLouisiana Superdome\nNew Orleans, La.\nMonsanto \"Mardi Grass\" turf\nXXI\nBroncos vs. Giants\nRose Bowl\nPasadena, Calif.\nGrass\nXXII\nWashington vs. Broncos\nJack Murphy Stadium\nSan Diego, Calif.\nGrass\nXXIII\nBengals vs. 49ers\nJoe Robbie Stadium\nMiami Gardens, Fla.\nGrass\nXXIV\n49ers vs. Broncos\nLouisiana Superdome\nNew Orleans, La.\nMonsanto \"Mardi Grass\" turf\nXXV\nBills vs. Giants\nTampa Stadium\nTampa, Fla.\nGrass\nXXVI\nWashington vs. Bills\nMetrodome\nMinneapolis, Minn.\nAstroTurf\nXXVII\nBills vs. Cowboys\nRose Bowl\nPasadena, Calif.\nGrass\nXXVIII\nCowboys vs. Bills\nGeorgia Dome\nAtlanta, Ga.\nAstroTurf\nXXIX\nChargers vs. 49ers\nJoe Robbie Stadium\nMiami Gardens, Fla.\nGrass\nXXX\nCowboys vs. Steelers\nSun Devil Stadium\nTempe, Ariz.\nGrass\nXXXI\nPatriots vs. Packers\nLouisiana Superdome\nNew Orleans, La.\nMonsanto \"Mardi Grass\" turf\nXXXII\nPackers vs. Broncos\nQualcomm Stadium\nSan Diego, Calif.\nGrass\nXXXIII\nBroncos vs. Falcons\nPro Player Stadium\nMiami Gardens, Fla.\nGrass\nXXXIV\nRams vs. Titans\nGeorgia Dome\nAtlanta, Ga.\nAstroTurf\nXXXV\nRavens vs. Giants\nRaymond James Stadium\nTampa, Fla.\nGrass\nXXXVI\nRams vs. Patriots\nLouisiana Superdome\nNew Orleans, La.\nMonsanto \"Mardi Grass\" turf\nXXXVII\nRaiders vs. Buccaneers\nQualcomm Stadium\nSan Diego, Calif.\nGrass\nXXXVIII\nPanthers vs. Patriots\nReliant Stadium\nHouston, Texas\nIndoor grass\nXXXIX\nPatriots vs. Eagles\nAlltel Stadium\nJacksonville, Fla.\nGrass\nXL\nSeahawks vs. Steelers\nFord Field\nDetroit, Mich.\nFieldTurf\nXLI\nColts vs. Bears\nDolphin Stadium\nMiami Gardens, Fla.\nGrass\nXLII\nGiants vs. Patriots\nUniversity of Phoenix Stadium\nGlendale, Ariz.\nIndoor grass\nXLIII\nSteelers vs. Cardinals\nRaymond James Stadium\nTampa, Fla.\nGrass\nXLIV\nSaints vs. Colts\nSun  Stadium\nMiami Gardens, Fla.\nGrass\nXLV\nSteelers vs. Packers\nCowboys Stadium\nArlington, Texas\nMatrix Turf\nXLVI\nGiants vs. Patriots\nLucas Oil Stadium\nIndianapolis, Ind.\nFieldTurf\nXLVII\nRavens vs. 49ers\nMercedes-Benz Superdome\nNew Orleans, La.\nSportturf\nXLVIII\nSeahawks vs. Broncos\nMet Stadium\nEast Rutherford, N.J.\nFieldTurf\nXLIX\nPatriots vs. Seahawks\nUniversity of Phoenix Stadium\nGlendale, Ariz.\nIndoor grass\n50\nPanthers vs. Broncos\nLevi's Stadium\nSanta Clara, Calif.\nGrass\nLI\nPatriots vs. Falcons\nNRG Stadium\nHouston, Texas\nFieldTurf\nLII\nEagles vs. Patriots\nU.S. Bank Stadium\nMinneapolis, Minn.\nSportturf\nLIII\nPatriots vs. Rams\nMercedes-Benz Stadium\nAtlanta, Ga.\nFieldTurf\nLIV\n49ers vs. Chiefs\nHard Rock Stadium\nMiami Gardens, Fla.\nGrass\nLV\nChiefs vs. Buccaneers\nRaymond James Stadium\nTampa, Fla.\nGrass\nLVI\nRams vs. Bengals\nSoFi Stadium\nInglewood, Calif.\nMatrix Turf\nLVII\nChiefs vs. Eagles\nState Farm Stadium\nGlendale, Ariz.\nIndoor grass\nLVIII\n49ers vs. Chiefs\nAllegiant Stadium\nLas Vegas, Nev.\nIndoor grass",

When asked by Stern if he'd consider inviting his good friend Paul McCartney into the mix, Joel shut down the suggestion. 'He was in the super-est group of all-time. I don't have the nerve to do that.'\nHowever, Ringo Starr is still fair game to him. 'He's a great drummer,' noted Joel. 'He doesn't get the credit he deserves.' Watch the full segment below.\nJoel has at least one member of the envisioned supergroup on lock, as Sting recently joined him for his tour stop in Tampa and will be appearing again with him in San Diego, St. Louis, San Antonio, and Las Vegas. His upcoming shows in Arlington, Texas and Chicago will feature Stevie Nicks.\nIt's been a particularly busy month for the Piano Man, who released his first new song in 17 years\u00a0before taking the stage at the Grammy Awards for the first live performance of 'Turn the Lights Back On.'\n\nAlso during the interview with Howard Stern, Joel reflected on jumping back into the studio with producer Freddy Wexler. 'This is an interesting vocal for me\u2026 I never like my own voice. I'm always disappointed,' he admitted. 'I actually heard the vocal on this recording and I didn't hate it. That's one of the first times that's ever happened to me.'\nThe singer is also gearing up for a record-breaking 100th consecutive performance at Madison Square Garden. The show, taking place on March 18th, will air as a special on CBS one month later on April 18th, and will be available to stream on Paramount+ the same day.\nBilly Joel 2024 Tour Dates: 02/24 \u2013 Tampa, FL @ Raymond James Stadium % 03/09 \u2013 Arlington, TX @ AT&T Stadium ^ 03/28 \u2013 New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden 04/13 \u2013 San Diego, CA @ Petco Park % 04/26 \u2013 New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden 05/09 \u2013 New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden 05/24 \u2013 Seattle, WA @ T-Mobile Park 06/08 \u2013 New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden 06/21 \u2013 Chicago, IL @ Soldier Field ^ 07/12 \u2013 Denver, CO @ Coors Field 07/25 \u2013 New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden 08/09 \u2013 Cardiff, UK @ Cardiff Principality Stadium 09/13 \u2013 Cleveland, OH @ Cleveland Browns Stadium # 09/27 \u2013 St. Louis, MO @ Busch Stadium % 10/25 \u2013 San Antonio, TX @ Alamodome % 11/09 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV @ Allegiant Stadium %\n% = w/ Sting ^ = w/ Stevie Nicks # = w/ Rod Stewart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSubscribe to Consequence's email digest and get the latest breaking news in music, film, and television, tour updates, access to exclusive giveaways, and more straight to your inbox.",

Players came here because of the fans, my family came here because of you,' said Richard Pitino, head coach for the UNM Men's Basketball Team. 'We know how important basketball is to this community, we appreciate you guys.'\nPlayers signed autographs for fans, while others reveled in the excitement, giving out hugs, and high fives.\n'You can feel the love from the city, and it's just beautiful,' said Sebastian Forsling, a junior center for the team.\nTheir 68 to 61 win over San Diego State last night marks the first time the team has won the tournament in a decade.\n'I feel like getting more hardware. I want some more,' said Jamal Mashburn Jr., a senior guard.\nThe \u2018secret' New Mexico museum the public will never see\nEven more, excitement filled the day as Lobo fans packed The Pit Sunday afternoon with less than 24 hours' notice to learn who the Lobos will play against in the NCAA tournament.\n'It's great that they're back in the tournament,' said Howard Humetewa, a longtime Lobo fan. 'As an 11 seed, I have mixed feelings, but the setup is really good.'\n'I've always dreamed of going to the Sweet 16 to watch, so I'm hoping this is the year,' said another fan.\nWhile fans couldn't be more thrilled to see the team return to make a post-season run, players and coaches say they're grateful to see all the fan support throughout the day.\n'It means so much to us winning this, and we've been fighting so hard and staying the course, so yeah, it was worth it,' Forsling said.\n'The support we get is unbelievable,' Pitino said. 'I said from day one, this is the reason I took the job was the fans, and to be welcomed by them at the airport brings a tear to your eye.'\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KRQE NEWS 13 - Breaking , Albuquerque , New Mexico , Weather, and Videos.",

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2014 They knock on your door or catch you while you're trying to shop. You might be interested, but you'll never let them know because you don't want to talk to salesmen.\nWho knows if what they're saying is actually true?\nThere's a place you can go for the straight story on money-saving government programs, and you might be surprised how much is available. The Nevada Clean Energy Fund (NCEF) is a nonprofit that's working to get the word out to Nevada residents. They can also tell you about NV Energy's programs to replace old appliances that are probably inflating your utility bills.\nIt's a challenge to figure out where you fit in the tangle of rebates and tax credits that are available now, and what you need to do to claim money that's available. Will Pregman, a loan officer and program manager for NCEF, wants the community to know that help is available through the nonprofit. They also maintain a list of licensed contractors who can do the work.\nHere are the federal tax credits that are currently available:\nWeatherization \u2014 up to $1,200\nRooftop solar, battery storage or geothermal heat \u2014 up to 30% of the cost\nNew electric vehicle \u2014 up to $7,500\nUsed electric vehicle \u2014 up to $4,000\nElectric vehicle charger \u2014 up to $1,000\nHeat pump air conditioner/heater \u2014 up to 30% of the cost\nHeat pump water heater \u2014 up to $2,000\nElectric panel \u2014 up to $600\nEnergy audit \u2014 up to $150\nSince they are tax credits, you have to have taxable income to offset the amount of the tax credit.\nBut that's really just the start. Programs offered by NV Energy can add to those savings. And the state is preparing to begin additional savings programs \u2014 likely in early 2025.\n'I think it's important that people are aware of what their options are and what they qualify for and the ways in which a lot of these incentives and tax credits and rebates can all be stacked on top of one another in order to maximize the amount of savings the consumer might see,' NCEF representative Will Pregman said.\nNCEF's website is at https://nevadacef.org/.\nPregman joined State Senator Dina Neal and County Commissioner William McCurdy II at a March 18 informational meeting at the Pearson Community Center, near Martin Luther King Boulevard and Carey Avenue. The meeting brought out some residents, but NCEF wants to spread the word to more Nevadans.\nIn an interview last week, Neal advised homeowners to watch for upcoming new programs that will be an important part of those savings. She says it's not just solar \u2014 the savings extend to water heaters, air conditioners, stoves, clothes dryers, insulation, electric wiring and more.\n'Some things are available and some things are going to be available,' Neal said.\nTracking what's available now and what's coming is a challenge, and NCEF can help residents sort that out. Even if you don't think you're eligible, it's worth checking with NCEF.\nFor example, NV Energy programs for new appliances 'are pretty flex,' according to Neal.\n'We hope to be kind of a one-stop shop for people that are looking to improve their homes, live more safely, more comfortably,' Pregman said. 'We want to be there for people who have questions about that stuff and need a little extra guidance on it.'\nSometimes rebates, tax credits and other financial help isn't enough. For that, NCEF offers 'RE-UP' loans.\n'One of the main barriers preventing homeowners from accessing the savings from the Clean Power Plan is the upfront cost of a home repair or upgrade,' Pregman said. 'We launched our Residential Energy Upgrade Program, or \u2018RE-UP,' to create an affordable financing option for these kinds of repairs and upgrades for low- or moderate-income Nevadans. The loans we offer through RE-UP, combined with rebates, tax credits, and other incentives, can put energy efficiency within reach for Nevada homeowners, lowering their monthly utility bills in the process.'\nAnother way that NCEF can assist: finding qualified contractors. They maintain a list of vetted contractors. More information is available by going to nevadacef.org and clicking on the 'Residents' button to find more information on contractors under the 'Find Contractors' link.\nAnd NCEF wants contractors to know they can be added to the list if they meet the requirements. 'We are looking to grow that list,' Pregman said. 'We invite contractors to apply to be part of our program.'\nPregman said NCEF offers a solar consumer protection guide on its website. He advised people who have had problems with contractors to get in touch with the Contractors Board. He said there's also a new effort by the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada \u2014 a complaint system for use with problems dealing with solar contractors.\nFor the latest news, weather, sports, and streaming video, head to KLAS.",

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2014 Southwest Gas customers across the Las Vegas valley and beyond are plagued by rising gas bills. The issue comes at a time when everyone's wallets are stretched thin by rising everyday costs like groceries and insurance.\nBetty Hollister struggled to wrap her head around the rising cost Saturday. She said she paid nearly $300 for January 2023.\n'This year it was $485 so let's round that to $500,' Hollister explained. 'I only used 22 more therms, but that $300 to $500 represents a 66% increase in my bill.'\nHollister's 66% increase is just one of several email and social media responses from customers in disbelief at their\u00a0gas bill.\nHank Hope wrote to 8  Now and reported a 62% increase year over year, with just 5% more usage. Kandace Valentine, a North Las Vegas resident with a two-story, five-bedroom home, reported being charged more money in December 2023 than in 2022 despite using less gas. Her bill has climbed from $124 in November 2023 to $300 in December and $360 in January 2024.\n'I turned my water heater down a couple weeks ago, but I do not know how much it will change,' she wrote in an email.\nSouthwest Gas blamed the bump in customer bills on their increased gas cost.\nThe company's statement read in part, 'Natural gas [\u2026] is subject to price fluctuations based on a variety of factors, including supply and demand. Colder than normal weather in the western United States during [\u2026] November 2022 through January 2023 time period, combined with the residual effects of winter storm Uri and the war in Ukraine, placed upward pressure on western U.S. gas prices.'\nWhile Annette Aerenson understands, she said the increase shouldn't be to this extent.\n'I am petrified to use my heat, to cook because I am afraid next month it will go to $800,' she said. 'It has shown an increase of 100%.'\nHer bill jumped from $115 in December to $230 in January and $430 is due mid-February.\nSouthwest Gas sent another response Saturday morning. 'In October 2023, the Southern Nevada gas cost rates decreased by about $0.069 per therm, compared to the gas cost rates effective July 2023.\u00a0 Similarly, the Southern Nevada gas cost rates decreased in January 2024 by approximately $0.027 per therm, when compared to the gas cost rates effective October 2023.'\nMeantime, 82-year-old retiree Marianne Laslo is feeling the pinch with hundreds of others. She posted on the Nextdoor app and was shocked to see the different reactions from people in a similar\u00a0situation.\n'There's a little increase and then another so the accumulative is 85%,' she said.\nLaslo's complaints to SWG and government officials have gone unanswered. She pointed a finger toward The Public Utilities Commission of Nevada which approved changes. The PUCN is currently considering a SWG's request to boost rates by about 10% in April.\nLaslo brought up the recent bonuses for SWG executives. The request rate hike is about two percentage points higher than the 8% raise SWG's former president and CEO James P. Hester received in 2022.\nHe pocketed $6.13 million in 2022, up from $5.674 million in 2021, according to the company's 2023 proxy statement.\n\nThe next PUCN hearing is scheduled\u00a0for Feb. 26.\nWhen asked about the possibility\u00a0of the hike in April, and the previously mentioned $8.14 increase for consumers, SWG sent the following statement:\nSouthwest Gas currently anticipates that its gas cost rates will again decrease April 2024 when compared to the gas cost rates effective January 2024.\u00a0 The Company's general rate case application is still pending with the Public Utilities Commission of Nevada, and therefore, customer rates have not yet been approved.\nHere is Southwest Gas's full statement on the reason behind rising costs:\nSouthwest Gas understands that customers may be facing higher than usual energy bills.\nThe Company experiences fluctuations in the cost of natural gas, which it procures on behalf of its customers, and passes those costs straight through with no mark-up or profit to the Company. Natural gas, like any commodity, is subject to price fluctuations based on a variety of factors, including supply and demand. Colder than normal weather in the western United States during the November 2022 through January 2023 time period, combined with the residual effects of winter storm Uri and the war in Ukraine, placed upward pressure on western US gas prices. These increased gas costs have been the primary driver of the recent increased customer bills.\nThe Company uses a 12-month rolling average of previously incurred natural gas costs to develop a portion of its gas cost rates. Consequently, there is a lag between the time in which the Company incurs the cost to procure natural gas on behalf of its customers and the time in which it charges customers for that previously incurred cost. Although Southwest Gas' Nevada customers have experienced increased gas cost rates over the past year or so primarily as a result of those external factors, they have experienced decreased gas cost rates in the Company's two most recent Nevada quarterly gas cost adjustments. We are hopeful that trend can continue.\nWe want to remind customers anytime during the year that\u00a0we offer tips,\u00a0tools\u00a0and programs to help manage their gas bills and energy usage. Southwest Gas has simple conservation tips for our residential customers to help keep winter heating bills down and conserve energy use. More information about energy conservation can be found at\u00a0www.swgas.com/energy-saving-tips.\nCustomers who need assistance paying their bill are encouraged to visit\u00a0www.swgas.com/en/nv-special-programs\u00a0to learn more about available financial assistance programs, such as the Energy Assistance Program and Weatherization Assistance Program, as well as flexible payment plan options.",

        "summary": "Across the largest cities in the U.S., the uptake on flu vaccinations has been split. While an average of 50.7% of people aged 65 and over were inoculated, some cities ranged much higher or lower. The efficacy of the flu vaccine is often argued, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claims a 40% to 60% efficacy at reducing flu cases, but only when the strains in that year's vaccine match the spreading virus strains.\nWith an eye on flu vaccine preferences, SmartAsset analyzed data from Medicare to rank 100 cities based on the percentage of seniors who received the flu shot in 2023.\nThese Midwestern cities top the list for the highest rates of flu vaccinations. In Madison, WI, 69% of Medicare enrollees were vaccinated for the flu season. In Lincoln and Omaha, NE, that figure was 66% and 63%, respectively. In Minnesota, Minneapolis (62%) and St. Paul (62%) also made the top ranks.\nMiami, FL has the lowest rate of flu shots. Only 34% of Miami seniors got the flu vaccine last year. El Paso, TX had the second-lowest rate at 36%, while 39% of seniors in Clark County, NV \u2014 including Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas and Enterprise \u2014 were inoculated.\nThe cities with the most seniors are split on flu shots. Seniors make up more than 22% of the population in Scottsdale, Port St. Lucie and Honolulu, and there's no distinct preference for or against the flu shot in these places. Respectively, 52%, 48% and 53% of seniors got the flu shot last year.\nMadison, WisconsinMadison leads the ranking with a 69% flu vaccination rate among seniors, who represent approximately 13.5% of the city's population. This adds up to 36,707 residents aged 65 and older.\nLincoln, NebraskaIn Lincoln, 66% of seniors have received a flu shot in 2023. Seniors make up 15.3% of the population, which includes 44,656 residents aged 65+.\nOmaha, Nebraska Omaha has a senior flu vaccination rate of 63%, with the 65+ demographic comprising 14.4% of its citizens. This adds up to 70,078 seniors.\nDurham, North CarolinaDurham reports a 62% vaccination rate among seniors. The city's population includes 13.8% of residents aged 65 and over, which totals 40,228 seniors.\nSt. Paul, Minnesota Approximately 62% of St. Paul's senior population have been vaccinated against the flu in 2023. Seniors constitute 13.0% of the city's population, with a total of 39,448 residents aged 65+.\nMinneapolis, Minnesota Minneapolis also shows a 62% flu vaccination rate in seniors. This age group represents 11.13% of the city's populace with 47,298 seniors.\nRaleigh, North CarolinaRaleigh has a 61% flu vaccination rate among its senior citizens. The 65+ age bracket makes up 12.3% of the population, which adds up to 58,522 seniors.\nSt. Louis, Missouri St. Louis has a 60% flu vaccination rate for seniors, who make up 15.8% of its population. There are 45,176 residents aged 65 and older.\nBaltimore, MarylandBaltimore's senior flu vaccination rate stands at 59%, with 89,326 seniors accounting for 15.7% of the population.\nPlano, TexasPlano has a 59% vaccination rate among its senior citizens. The 65+ age group makes up 14.30% of the city's population, with a total of 41,479 seniors.\nData is for 2023 and comes from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps. The percentage of seniors with the flu shot is represented by the percentage of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare enrollees that had an annual flu vaccination. Medicare enrollees must be at least 65 years old. Data was examined for the largest 100 cities for which data was available. Cities are mapped to county-level data.\nPhoto credit: \u00a9iStock.com/FatCamera\nThe post Flu Vaccines Are Most Popular in These U.S. Cities \u2013 2024 Study appeared first on SmartReads by SmartAsset.",

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS (KLAS) \u2014 Video obtained by the 8  Now Investigators shows wild horses being roped and dragged by contractors whom the federal government hired. The wild horses were being captured during a federal roundup in northern Nevada led by the Bureau of Land Management.\nThe BLM began the East Pershing Wild Horse Gather on Dec. 28, according to its website. The area, located between Lovelock and Winnemucca, is more than 2.1 million acres.\nThe BLM stated that 2,875 wild horses needed to be removed to restore an 'ecological balance and multiple-use relationship on public lands.'\nCritics have argued that the government is appeasing ranchers for their cattle.\nAs of Jan. 29, the BLM reported that 24 wild horses died and 2,048 had been captured.\nObservers for the group 'Wild Horse Education' regularly monitor these types of operations.\n'Roundups need to stop until BLM creates an enforceable welfare policy,' the group posted on its website.\nThe video also shows a helicopter flying close to the wild horses during several chases.\nDocuments reviewed by the 8  Now Investigators revealed that a contract for $690,000 was awarded to Shayne Sampson of Utah for the East Pershing Wild Horse Gather.\nThe 8  Now Investigators reached Shayne Sampson by phone on Tuesday. He referred the inquiry to the BLM and then hung up on the reporter.\nOn Jan. 24, Rep. Dina Titus (D-NV) and Rep. Steven Cohen (D-TN) asked BLM Director Tracy Stone-Manning to pause the East Pershing Complex gather operation.\nIn a letter, they pointed to 20 horse deaths in less than a month and stated it 'has further demonstrated persisting faults in BLM's wild horse strategy.'\nTitus and Cohen also expressed concerns about BLM's Tentative Wild Horse and Burro Gather and Fertility Control Schedule which includes gathering nearly 21,000 horses compared to the nearly 7,000 scheduled for roundups in 2023.\nThe plan for the new fiscal year included roundups throughout New Mexico, Nevada, Wyoming, California, Arizona, Utah and Colorado.\nTitus and Cohen also criticized the use of helicopters.\nSome wild horse advocates have pushed for fertility control. According to the BLM, no wild horses in the East Pershing Wild Horse Gather will be treated with fertility control.\nWild horses captured during the gathering are brought to a corral where they can then be adopted or sold, according to the BLM.\nTitus introduced a bill in 2022 to ban the use of helicopters. In May of 2023, the 'Wild Horse and Burro Protection Act' was introduced into Congress marking the first step of the legislative process. The following month, it was referred to the Subcommittee on Federal Lands.\nNevada has the largest population of wild horses.",

        "excerpt": "For sex workers and their clients, Super Bowl season can mean a higher chance of getting nabbed by cops.",
        "summary": "Super Bowl LVIII is fast approaching. For many Americans, that will mean gathering with friends to watch the game, enjoy some sort of dip-based snacks, and gripe about the halftime show. But for sex workers and those who would like to patronize them, it will mean a higher chance of getting nabbed by cops.\nUnder the guise of \"stopping sex trafficking,\" authorities tend to ramp up prostitution stings around Super Bowl time. The ostensible motive behind this is that large sporting events like the Super Bowl draw an influx of traffickers and their victims to the locales hosting these events.\nYet no one has managed to marshal evidence of these hordes of traffickers allegedly descending on Super Bowl cities. The best authorities can do is sometimes point to a spike in Super Bowl weekend arrests of sex workers and their customers\u2014a spike easily explained by the fact that cops are making a concerted effort to catch people offering to sell or pay for sex.\nThe Super Bowl sex trafficking myth is a sequel of sorts to an earlier idea\u2014that domestic violence increased around the Super Bowl\u2014for which there was also no evidence. Both myths have served a political agenda.\nIn this case, the myth gives law enforcement license to do more policing of sex workers and more surveillance generally; lends itself to splashy campaigns by nonprofits that use these theatrics to garner donations; and bolsters an idea (sex trafficking is everywhere!) used to push tough-on-sex-work policies.\nThis year's Super Bowl takes place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Today, Nevada sex workers and their allies will be gathering at the stadium to protest Super Bowl sex stings and the myths that encourage them.\n\"Every year, the Super Bowl is used as an excuse to violently arrest sex workers under the guise of anti-trafficking raids,\" notes a press release about the protest, which is being organized by the Las Vegas Red Umbrella Collective (LVRUC); the Sex Workers and Erotic Service Provider Legal, Educational and Research Project (ESPLERP); and the International Sex Worker Foundation for Art, Culture, and Education (ISWFACE). This \"Stop the Raids\" coalition also held two days of workshops and community-building activities for sex workers over the past weekend.\nPolice, media, and nonprofits \"are all touting that false and misleading narrative that large sporting events cause forced labor in the sex trade and therefore warrants arresting us,\" says Maxine Doogan of ESPLERP. \"It's clearly not good for us, or the sex trafficking victims or our clients to be burdened and punished with a prostitution arrests.\"\nTheir goal \"is to call attention to the public and the press that we're not forced to work in the sex trade,\" says Doogan. \"It's not OK to call us and our clients 'sex-trafficking victims and traffickers.' We're workers, and our clients are our clients.\"\nA decade ago, almost all reporting on \"Super Bowl sex trafficking\" seemed to be wholly credulous of law enforcement's narrative. From 2010 to 2016, 76 percent of U.S. print media stories on the subject \"propagated the 'Super Bowl sex trafficking' narrative,\" according to a 2019 paper published in the Anti-Trafficking Review. Back in 2014\u2014when Maggie McNeill challenged this narrative in Reason\u2014questioning it was a pretty lonely perch.\nIn recent years, more outlets have been willing to push back against the official narrative, and pieces challenging it have appeared in such publications as  Illustrated, The Washington Post, Slate, Vice, and The Atlantic.\nBut there's still plenty of life yet in this old trope. Stories about Super Bowl sex trafficking have been peppering Las Vegas media in recent weeks.\nSome groups pushing it tend to be less certain in their rhetoric than we've seen previously. But they still suggest that sex trafficking could increase around the Super Bowl. \"It really comes down to basic numbers\u2014where there are people the possibility of crime and trafficking increases,\" posted Agape International Missions (AIM) in January. \"As the Super Bowl draws thousands of people to one location, this holds true.\"\nThank you to @its_apenalty for having AG @AaronDFordNV at today's event to discuss how the OAG and law enforcement are working to end human trafficking in Nevada. pic.twitter.com/uOHeE4hH9s\n\u2014 NV Attorney General (@NevadaAG) January 29, 2024\nThe fact that this year's Super Bowl is happening in Vegas gives groups another angle for spreading discredited propaganda. Prostitution is not legal in Las Vegas, but many think it is, due to the city's reputation and the fact that some counties in Nevada do allow legal brothels.\n\"While the general link between human trafficking and Super Bowl host cities has become more speculative, Las Vegas may provide an exception to this conclusion,\" AIM suggested, adding that praying and giving to groups like AIM could help combat this.\nThis is how a lot of \"anti-trafficking efforts\" go: a mission to raise \"awareness\" about the issue that in turn encourages donations to the nonprofit \"raising awareness.\" Which might all be well and good if these groups were making substantial strides toward helping people in abusive or exploitative situations. But often their \"outreach\" and \"support\" efforts amount to little more than additional \"awareness\" raising, and perhaps handing out bags of toiletries to people police pick up in prostitution stings.\nCampaigns like the \"It's a Penalty\" initiative working to spread \"awareness\" about Super Bowl sex trafficking aren't running shelters for victims or helping them find jobs or providing them with legal aid. No, the folks behind these initiatives spend their time and resources doing things like passing out branded stickers and pens, making ads featuring professional athletes, and encouraging people to report their hunches to authorities.\nA Las Vegas nonprofit called Signs of HOPE \"will be educating employees at Caesars , MGM Resorts Wynn Resort properties\" about how to spot sex traffickers, reports the Las Vegas Sun.\nThis is another anti-trafficking trope\u2014that eagle-eyed hotel staff, airline employees, salon workers, etc., can spot the \"signs\" of sex trafficking if they're just \"aware\" enough. But the \"signs\" taught tend to be utter nonsense: a mix of sexist, racist, or classist stereotypes with things broad enough to apply to just about anyone.\nFor instance, Signs of HOPE chief Kimberly Small told the Sun that the potential signs of being a trafficking victim include lack of eye contact, excessive phone use, or being too quiet.\nSigns of HOPE, It's a Penalty, and other groups urge people to report anything suspicious. It's an ethos likely to lead to the harassment of any women dressed provocatively or acting flirtatiously.\nHosting spot-a-trafficker trainings may net cash or good P.R. for the groups that run them and the corporations that make employees sit through them. But no one seems to be offering evidence that it is helping anyone catch traffickers or rescue their victims.\nWe have, however, seen plenty of cases where it's led to people getting reported for being in interracial couples or multiracial families. There's also some evidence that it leads to increased surveillance of women generally.\nFor the 2024 Las Vegas Campaign, we want to express our gratitude to our incredible partners: @wynnlasvega@mgmresortsintl @caesarsentertainment @lasairport@raiders @airbnb @Hilton @southwestairCarlson Family Foundation @motel6 @ihghotels@ahlafoundation pic.twitter.com/MsfzCdNnVB\n\u2014 It's a Penalty (@its_apenalty) January 25, 2024\n\"Small added that people should even be aware of odd-looking situations, such as when a young child is being picked up by an older person, especially if the child seems unfamiliar with them,\" reported the Sun. This manages to mix two trafficking myths into one: the idea that there are large swaths of actual children in the U.S. being trafficked, and the idea that trafficking\u2014of adults or minors\u2014is generally done by strangers.\n\"The truth about trafficking, particularly in the context of minors, is that it is often not perpetrated by strangers but by those within their own circles\u2014friends, acquaintances and, tragically, family members,\" writes ISWFACE's Victoria McMahan Parra in The Nevada Independent. \"This pattern of exploitation, deeply rooted in a complex web of socioeconomic factors, reflects a systemic issue that goes beyond the simplistic narratives often peddled by sensationalist media and misinformed anti-trafficking campaigns.\"\nMedia in general, and especially local media, tends to be deferential to official narratives, especially when they're coming from cops. Their business also thrives on lurid stories and warnings of danger. So it's not surprising that apocryphal tales of Super Bowl sex-crime spikes keep resurfacing in the press.\nMore interesting is why police are framing these efforts as sex trafficking or human trafficking stings in the first place. If it's just an old-fashioned vice squad doing an old-fashioned prostitution sting, why all the fanfare about traffickers? Why not just tell the public they're out to catch consenting adults who mix money with their sex?\nReason's J.D. Tuccille explained this pretty concisely back in 2016:\nOpponents of commercial sex find themselves on the wrong side of shifting public opinion, so they pull a little rhetorical sleight of hand\u2026.The implication of the \"trafficking\" terminology is that prostitutes are slaves\u2014and they're being hustled off to a major sporting event near you.\nSpending taxpayer money and police time to make sure people aren't privately trading sex for money (or vice versa) is the kind of thing many folks dislike. Stopping slavery sounds so much more noble\u2014a cause that everyone can get behind.\nIt also lets the federal government get involved. Selling and paying for sex aren't federal crimes. But sex trafficking\u2014defined under federal law as commercial sex involving minors, force, fraud, or coercion\u2014is. That gives the FBI and the\u00a0Department of Homeland Security a good impetus to intervene (and if the stings just happen to serve as a good cover for all sorts of surveillance, so be it).\nFraming prostitution stings as anti-human-trafficking initiatives also lets local law enforcement access grant money the feds give out for stopping trafficking. These grants do not exist, theoretically, for simply stopping some guy from paying a consenting adult partner for sex.\nOf course, all of this goes on without anyone having to actually prove that their work is helping victims of violence or abuse.\nWhat results are \"taxpayer-funded sting operations\" against \"men and women who are engaged in work our government has deemed unacceptable,\" writes Parra in her Nevada Independent piece. She notes that even when police stings do uncover people who could use assistance or protection, they're often treated as criminals because they fail to fit some perfect victim image. \"These stings, rather than addressing the nuanced and pervasive nature of trafficking, only perpetuate a cycle of criminalization and marginalization of already vulnerable groups.\"\nToday's protest in Vegas will be the third for Stop the Raids, which previously organized a protest in Phoenix around Super Bowl time last year and also a protest in Los Angeles last December.\nThe Los Angeles rally was held in protest of City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto's policies \"that criminalize and harass sex workers and their clients, all under the guise of rescuing sex trafficking victims,\" according to the group's website. \"Feldstein-Soto has been weaponizing the archaic Red Light Abatement Act of 1913 to shut down motels where LA residents, particularly sex workers, had worked indoors safely.\"\nThe post It's Time to Retire Super Bowl 'Sex Trafficking' Stings and Myths appeared first on Reason.com.",

Who Also Just Happens To Be One Of Utah's Highest Ranked High School Tennis Players\n\n\nLas Vegas, NV, Feb. 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The San Francisco quarterback knows the meme. Now, the high school athlete behind it will be cheering him on at 'The Big Game' in Las Vegas.\nAnna Frey, who has spent the 2023 Pro Football Season as a TikTok\u00ae sensation due to her similar likeness to the San Francisco starting quarterback, has inked a Name, Image and Likeness deal of her own with Six Star Pro Nutrition\u00ae, America's #1 selling Sports Nutrition brand1, who will fulfill her prophecy of attending 'The Big Game' with a signing bonus that includes tickets, travel and hospitality in Las Vegas.\nFrey's announcement on TikTok has generated more than six million views with coverage in the New York Post\u00ae, Barstool Sports\u00ae, BroBible\u00ae and the Arizona Republic\u00ae, the quarterback's hometown newspaper.\n'It isn't simply that Anna has embraced being part of the Big Game storyline, but this is a seamless integration for Six Star Pro Nutrition\u00ae and our desire to work with an athlete on her journey from high school to college and then to the pros,' said Tim Toll, CEO of Iovate Health Sciences, the parent company of Six Star Pro Nutrition\u00ae.

Prior to 2021, an athlete like Frey would never have the opportunity to leverage her newfound fame for financial gain due to the fear of losing her athletic eligibility.\nAccording to TennisRecruting.net, Frey, now a sophomore, is considered the top ranked player in both Utah and in the Mountain region and is the sixth-ranked player nationally in singles. As a 14-year-old, she won the 6A State Championship at Farmington High School and holds a 38-11 record, including a 13-7 record against fellow Blue Chip prospects and a 13-1 record against five-star prospects.\n'Sports nutrition has been an active conversation with my parents and coaches as I continue my athletic career, which made this deal stand out \u2014 besides going to THE BIG GAME, of course,' said Frey. 'The history of Six Star Pro Nutrition\u00ae advocating for athletes and their NIL rights also created a level of comfort, as they believe that someone in my situation should be able to financially benefit from opportunities that may come my way.'\nAs part of the agreement, Frey will become an ambassador for Six Star\u00ae 100% Whey Protein Plus in all of its flavors. Since 2021, the brand has made high school sports a top priority, including school-wide partnerships with athletic departments in 15 different states. She joins Pro Football All-Pro T.J.

Sentinum anticipates expanding the capacity at Montana to the extent possible, after determination of the completed load study, subject to additional funding.\nWilliam B. Horne, Chief Executive Officer of Ault Alliance, stated, \"Sentinum continues to work on improving operations and will begin transferring machines from its Michigan site to its Montana data center.

The Michigan facility, which features redundant, geographically diverse, fiber optic connectivity from multiple carriers and significant power expansion capabilities, was designed to meet the demands of AI computing and it was always our intention that the Michigan site would have minimal exposure to our mining operations.

        "excerpt": "Look for Wagyu short ribs, a specialty Caesar salad and kabocha squash seafood bisque.",
        "summary": "Fat City is gone. Wagyu city has taken its place.\nArmenian American steakhouse V's Paradise will host its grand opening Friday at 1001 Front St., the longtime home of Fat City Bar & Cafe in Old Sacramento.\nA soft opening began Feb. 29, and while the menu has yet to be fully set, general manager Richard Kazanjian said the kitchen would source local meat and vegetables to prepare steaks as well as lesser-seen options.\nThere are $69 rib-eyes, Wagyu short ribs ($47) and confit chicken wings ($19) with blue cheese from Point Reyes Farmstead Cheese Co. But diners can also enjoy beef tartare ($28) held together by yogurt, lamb khorovats skewers ($26) or a Caesar salad ($16) dressed with the Armenian spice mix chaimen.\nVeteran local chefs Tyler Bond and Joe Pruner are getting the kitchen started as culinary consultants. Both will stay on at V's Paradise for three or four months, developing the menu while training staff members to replace them, Bond said.\nBond formerly co-owned the venerable Lemon Grass Restaurant in Loehmann's Plaza shopping center and will open Chinese-Vietnamese concept Chu Mai with Kru Contemporary Japanese Cuisine founder Billy Ngo later this year. Pruner was most recently The Bank's chef de cuisine, and previously the executive chef at Allora in East Sacramento and chef de cuisine at Mother during the all-vegetarian spot's downtown era.\nBond's inclination toward Asian cooking shows up in a few V's Paradise dishes, including a kabocha squash bisque ($25) with poached lobster and prawns and a miso-glazed black cod ($36). Housemade desserts include a seasonal pavlova ($13), ricotta zeppole ($14) and a chocolate ganache cake ($15).\n'I want it to be international, so we're bringing some Armenian flair, of course some California-style steakhouse and vegetable dishes, and also some inspiration from Japan because of my background,' Bond said.\nOwner Vardan Sargsyan wants to add some theatrical elements to the food presentation such as creating smoke with dry ice, similar to steakhouses in Chicago or Las Vegas, Bond said. But like many restaurants in downtown or Old Sacramento, V's Paradise will have to find customers outside of one-off occasions. Kazanjian hopes people come for upscale dinners, but also for post-work drinks or a nightcap after Golden 1 Center events.\n'We're really trying to make this a high-quality premier destination, not only for the district but for the city and state,' Kazanjian said. 'The hope is that this is the kind of place where not only someone can come annually for their dinner for their birthday or anniversary, but someplace they can bring (people) to entertain their guests or family.'\nThe dark, sleek restaurant and cocktail bar with brick walls and modern finishes will source wines from Amador, Napa and Sonoma counties as well as Europe and Armenia. It'll eventually encompasses about 8,500 square feet once a dance hall is built out, Bond said.\nFat City was the Old Sacramento sister concept to elegant downtown Chinese American restaurant Frank Fat's, and leaned more into the American side, with tri-colored nachos, turkey avocado BLTs and bacon cheeseburgers on its final menu. It closed in late 2019 after 43 years in business.\nV's Paradise is open from 5-9 p.m. Wednesday and Thursday, 5-11 p.m. Friday and Saturday and closed Sunday-Tuesday.",

        "excerpt": "Nikki Haley is competing in the just the primary, but only the caucuses award delegates for the Republican presidential nomination",
        "summary": "When Nevada Republicans started receiving their mail-in ballots for the state's 6 February primary, Nikki Haley's name was on them, but a key person was missing: Donald Trump. It's not an accident.\nInstead of appearing on the primary ballot in the key swing state, Trump is participating in the separate Republican caucuses to take place two days after the primary, on 8 February. Haley isn't participating in those caucuses. The bizarre set-up means that Nevada Republicans will be asked to vote in a primary on 6 February and then in caucuses two days later to choose their party's nominee. Only the caucuses will determine how Nevada's 26 delegates are awarded at the Republican national convention.\nThe Nevada Republican party created the chaotic scheme, changing its nomination rules last year, in what many say is a thinly veiled effort to benefit Trump. The changes have made Nevada's GOP nomination in the primary essentially irrelevant and left voters confused.\n'What it's probably doing is a) creating a lot of confusion and b) gonna reduce turnout and participation, which totally undermines the purpose of the caucuses, which is for party building,' said David Damore, a political science professor at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.\nThey did it because they are controlled by Trump people, and Trump wouldn't like it if anything were left to chance\nJon Ralston of the Nevada Independent\nMichael McDonald, the head of the Nevada Republican party, was one of six fake Trump electors indicted by Nevada's attorney general, Aaron Ford. Jesse Law, the chair of the Clark county Republican party who also served in the Trump administration, and Jim DeGraffenreid, a Nevada Republican National Committee member, were also charged.\n'\u200b\u200bThey did it because they are controlled by Trump people, and Trump wouldn't like it if anything were left to chance,' said Jon Ralston, a well-respected Nevada political commentator who is CEO of the Nevada Independent. 'He would almost surely have won the primary, too, but with universal mail ballots and a much larger universe, it would not have been as big a margin, probably.'\nIn 2021, Nevada lawmakers approved a measure requiring the state to hold a primary election for the presidential preference contest. But last year, the state Republican party decided it wanted to hold caucuses instead. The party said it would award all of its delegates to the winner of the caucus. It also barred anyone who participated in the primary from also participating in the caucuses. It imposed a $55,000 fee to participate and prohibited Super Pacs from intervening in the caucuses \u2013 widely seen as an attack on Ron DeSantis, who relied heavily on his Super Pac throughout his campaign before dropping out in January.\nRelated: What's next in the US primary election: key dates\nUnder Nevada law, all voters are automatically mailed a ballot for the primary unless they opt out. There is also in-person early voting that began on 27 January, and voters can register to vote at the polls. The caucuses, by contrast, will take place from 5pm to 7.30pm, and voters have to appear in person and show ID to participate. Unlike a primary, in which votes are cast by ballot over the course of an early voting period and entire election days, voters in a caucus must show up in person at a designated place with their neighbors, where they are then given a ballot, after which they submit it and can stay and watch it get counted.\nPublicly, Nevada Republicans have said the caucuses are needed to ensure the integrity of the vote, even though voter fraud is exceedingly rare. 'The caucus, until we get voter ID, and we get the mail-in ballot situation under control \u2013 the only pure way to have this is through a caucus,' McDonald, the Nevada Republican chair, said in an October interview with the Nevada newsmakers podcast.\nMcDonald, who said in 2015 he favored primaries because they increased participation, did not respond to a request for an interview.\nJoe Lombardo, Nevada's Republican governor, has said he will caucus for Trump but has criticized the dual primary and caucus system as confusing and said it would disenfranchise voters.\nRalston said the party's election integrity concerns were nonsense. 'They want only the base to turn out, and the smaller the turnout, the better Trump is likely to do, especially now with only [Ryan] Binkley against him and no \u2018none of the above' to choose,' he said, referring to the long-shot candidate.\nHaley, along with Mike Pence and Tim Scott, chose to participate in the primary last year. Trump, Ron DeSantis, Vivek Ramaswamy, and Chris Christie all chose to participate in the caucuses. Because Haley is the only candidate left in the primary, she is guaranteed to win. Trump, similarly, is the only remaining major candidate in the caucuses and is guaranteed to win that contest.\nHaley has said she's not participating in the caucuses because it was rigged for Trump. 'I mean, talk to the people in Nevada. They will tell you the caucuses have been sealed off, bought and paid for for a long time. And so that's why we got into the primary,' Haley told reporters during a campaign stop in Epping, New Hampshire, last month.\nAnd Trump's campaign has gloated over its guaranteed win in the caucuses.\n'On February 8th, Nikki Haley will be handed her third straight loss \u2013 in Nevada. She inexplicably signed up to be included on the state Primary ballot despite the fact that she could not earn delegates in the Primary,' Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita, who both lead Trump's campaign, wrote in a memo on Monday.\nBecause we already won Nevada ! https://t.co/M15D7N9xlg\n\u2014 Chris LaCivita (@LaCivitaC) January 24, 2024\nStill, Trump allies have spread misinformation falsely suggesting the primary is unauthorized and Trump was wrongfully excluded from it. The presidential primary is required by state law \u2013 but Trump chose not to participate in the primary so he could be a candidate in the caucuses.\nNothing to see here, just Trumplodyte Kash Patel lying about NV, just as Trump did. The reason Trump is not on the primary ballot is because NV GOP would not allow him to be. He is accusing the state government of rigging the primary, running \"an election disinfo scam.\" My God. pic.twitter.com/SBCavelh95\n\u2014 Jon Ralston (@RalstonReports) January 22, 2024\nVoters are confused about the process and why Trump isn't on the primary ballot, said Cisco Aguilar, Nevada's secretary of state.\n'Voters ask that question all the time,' he said in an interview. 'It's interesting because we did talk about it, we did address it, we tried to do as much mitigation as we could prior to the ballots being received. However, it's human nature that the voter is only going to pay attention to what's right in front of them at that moment in time.'\nThe confusion is exacerbated by the fact that the primary is run by state officials and the caucuses are run entirely by the state GOP.\nRelated: Who's running for president in 2024? The Republican and Democratic candidates\nKerry Durmick, the Nevada state director for All Voting Is Local, a non-partisan group focused on expanding voting access, said she went to observe one of the first days of early voting and saw confusion.\n'I did see a lot of voters say, \u2018Oh, I thought today was the caucus. Oh, I thought we were voting in February. Can I vote today or do I need to vote then?'' she said. 'Legally the parties can handle the process however they want to. Where I'm frustrated, where All Voting Is Local is frustrated, is the lack of outreach that was done by this particular party around this particular process because this was the choice that they made.'\nRepublicans are also reportedly still seeking volunteers to staff the caucus sites, which the party was still finalising less than a month ahead of the event, according to the Las Vegas Sun.\nThere could be even more confusion if the dual contest system results in both candidates claiming victory in Nevada. After 6 February, Haley could claim she won the Nevada primary. Two days later, Trump will claim he won the caucuses.\n'To the degree that there's any sort of media attention of the Tuesday results, it's gonna be \u2018Nikki Haley wins the Nevada primary. Oh, but Donald Trump wasn't on the ballot.' That's a more complicated soundbite but she can certainly spin that,' said Damore.\nDuring a rally in Las Vegas last weekend, Trump reminded his supporters to turn out, even though he's guaranteed to win the contest. 'We do want to get a good vote. We're not going to have a lot of competition, I think. But it doesn't matter. We want to get a great, beautiful mandate,' he said.\n'It's very important for you to help educate all of our supporters that we're not talking about the government-run, universal mail-in ballots. We don't want mail-in ballot,' he added. 'Do the caucus, not the primary. The primary is meaningless. I don't know, maybe they'll try and use it for public relations purposes.'\nLauren Gambino contributed reporting",

But yes, you will likely pay more than what those who got pre-sale did. Sorry! Checking out resale platforms like StubHub, you'll find entry-level tickets priced around $130 for seats in the upper sections, which still feel doable by today's concert ticket standards.\nIf you want floor seats, it'll cost you, though. During our search, we spotted floor tickets starting at $1100 and go upwards of $2400. Keep in mind, when buying tickets from resale sites like StubHub, your exact seats are not usually specified upon purchase. They'll indicate the zone and that the tickets you're buying will be 'seated together,' however, you won't know the spot until the tickets are delivered.\nRemember, ticket prices are subject to change based on demand, so keep tabs on them. Check back frequently if you're not quite ready to hit \"checkout.\" You can keep looking to find the best deal for you, but from our experience, the sooner you buy, the better!

Given Bad Bunny's extensive collaborations, fans can anticipate an electrifying lineup.\nOne aspect you can undoubtedly count on is lengthy lines at the merchandise stands, so it's wise to plan accordingly. Arriving early ensures you have ample time to wait for tour merchandise. Alternatively, you can peruse the setlist beforehand on setlist.fm (once the first shows happen and we get a better idea, that is) to identify the best moments during the concert to skip songs that may not top your playlist.\nBad Bunny aficionados, don't forget to make good use of ticket site filters. While scouring ticket sale platforms, utilize the filtering options to tailor your search according to preferences, such as seating sections and prices.\nWhen choosing your tickets, pay close attention to the section's proximity to the stage. For added assurance, leverage resources like AViewFromMySeat.com, offering user-generated venue photos from past events.\nWith these tips in mind, we're rooting for your success in snagging tickets to see Bad Bunny in 2024!\n\nNicole Richie's Surprising Adoption Story",

With multiple transfers coming in\u00a0as well as multiple stars on both sides of the ball\u00a0forgoing the NFL draft\u00a0to come back to the Buckeyes for the 2024 season, hopes are high among Buckeye nation.\nOhio State has also gotten some good news on the recruiting front in the offseason. The Buckeyes wrapped up one of the best 2024 classes in college football by bringing in Julian Sayin, the top ranked quarterback in the class who transferred from\u00a0Alabama\u00a0after\u00a0Nick Saban's retirement.\nThe Buckeyes have also landed some big commitments out of the 2025 class including 4-star offensive tackle Carter Lowe who committed to Ohio State on Saturday.\nWith Lowe already on board the Buckeyes are in good shape at offensive tackle for the 2025 class. However ideally, they might need to land one of two more players at the position.\nThus far, Ohio State has offered Lowe and ten other offensive tackles in the 2025 class. We'll walk through each of those using On3 who is one of the top college football recruiting resources that tracks player rankings on all four main websites and provides predictions, insights, and NIL valuations.\n#BOOM Ohio State adds a priority offensive tackle to its 2025 class by landing the commitment of Carter Lowe. https://t.co/M6asW9V8iM\n\u2014 Eleven Warriors (@11W) January 27, 2024\nRecruiting Class\u00a0| 2025 High School | Whitmer (Toledo, OH) Height/Weight | 6-5, 285 On 3 NIL Valuation | $74K Annual Value\nOn3 Industry | 4 Star No. 85 Natl No. 9 OT No. 3 OH On 3 | 4 Star No. 172 Natl No. 13 OT No. 10 OH 247 | 4 Star No. 32 Natl No. 4 OT No. 2 OH ESPN | 4 Star No. 146 Natl No. 20 OT No. 6 OH Rivals | 4 Star No. 91 Natl No. 10 OT No. 3 OH\nCurrent Leader | Ohio State (Committed 1/27/2024) Ohio State Prediction % | 96.8% Ohio State Visits | 8 (second most of any team)\n2025 5-star OT David Sanders is coveted by many of the top programs in the county and he updates his recruitment: https://t.co/XhWtSoIimK (On3+) pic.twitter.com/LqigKikU4I\n\u2014 ChadSimmons (@ChadSimmons_) January 23, 2024\nRecruiting Class\u00a0| 2025 High School | Providence Day School (Charlotte, NC) Height/Weight | 6-5.5, 250 On 3 NIL Valuation | $185K Annual Value\nOn3 Industry | 5 Star No. 2 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC On 3 | 4 Star No. 5 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC 247 | 5 Star No. 2 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC ESPN | 5 Star No. 3 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC Rivals | 5 Star No. 1 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC\nCurrent Leader | Georgia Ohio State Prediction % | 2.3% Ohio State Visits | 1 (tied for ninth most of any team)\nLewisville 2025 On3 Industry Rankings four-star OT Michael Fasusi hitting the second levelhttps://t.co/GOhtJvUhfa pic.twitter.com/mt9Nf5imjT\n\u2014 Griffin McVeigh (@Griffin_McVeigh) September 2, 2023\nRecruiting Class\u00a0| 2025 High School | Lewisville (Lewisville, TX) Height/Weight | 6-4.5, 300 On 3 NIL Valuation | $132K Annual Value\nOn3 Industry | 5 Star No. 2 OT No. 4 TX On 3 | 4 Star No. 36 Natl No. 5 OT No. 8 TX 247 | 4 Star No. 39 Natl No. 5 OT No. 6 TX ESPN | 5 Star No. 10 Natl No. 3 OT No. 2 TX Rivals | 5 Star No. 11 Natl No. 3 OT No. 4 TX\nCurrent Leader | Oklahoma Ohio State Prediction % | <1% Ohio State Visits | None\n5.

        "excerpt": "UFC's Tatiana Suarez is no stranger to dealing with knee issues, but ensures this instance won't keep her out of action for long.",
        "summary": "A familiar issue is what prompted undefeated UFC strawweight contender  to delay her first appearance in 2024.\nAfter knee problems sidelined Suarez (10-0 MMA, 7-0 UFC) for over 44 months, she was able to return to action in 2023 to pick up right where she left off. Suarez earned a pair of victories and was ready to continue her momentum toward a title shot at UFC 298.\nHowever, an injury occurred, but Suarez did not previously reveal any details about her withdrawal from the event when it was announced.\n'They told me not to tell people what it is, but it's like kind of one of those things if you just ask anybody who trains with me, they're like, \u2018Yeah, Tatiana's knee is hurt a little bit,'' Suarez said on the Two Straws Podcast. 'It's not a big injury, but it's a very strange injury.\n'Basically what happened was my knee just completely swelled, like got so swollen where I couldn't bend it or do anything. All I could do was literally hit mits. If I go hard, it starts to hurt, so I have to tone it down. I couldn't bend my knee completely, so I couldn't do any grappling or any wrestling, or any sparring.'\nSuarez, No. 2 in the USA TODAY /MMA Junkie women's strawweight rankings, was scheduled to fight No. 6 Amanda Lemos at UFC 298, but was forced to withdraw. She remains optimistic that her next fight will come soon as she continues to take care of herself in the training room.\nIn 2023, Suarez submitted Montana De La Rosa at flyweight and Jessica Andrade at strawweight \u2013 both by rear-naked choke. Known for her dominant grappling game,\u00a0Suarez has used the injury as an opportunity to work on her boxing, elevating another aspect of her game while recovering.\n'The other day I did do boxing,' Suarez said. '\u2026 If you watch all of my fights, I'm  of a kicker. It forced me to actually box, and I was doing OK. I was like, \u2018Oh hell yeah! I'm Muhammad Ali!''\ntatiana-suarez-tuf-23-finale-weigh-ins\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\ntatiana-suarez-amanda-cooper-tuf-23-finale-weigh-ins\nShare\nimage\ngallery\non Facebook\non Twitter\nvia text message\nvia email\n\nMMA: TUF Finale-Team Suarez vs Team Cooper\nJul 8, 2016; Las Vegas, NV, USA;  (red gloves) fights Amanda Cooper (blue gloves)\u2026\nJul 8, 2016; Las Vegas, NV, USA;  (red gloves) fights Amanda Cooper (blue gloves) during The Ultimate Fighter Finale at MGM Grand Garden Arena.

        "excerpt": "The pop sensation is back, so get ready to dance.",
        "summary": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\nJustin Timberlake fans, mark your calendars and dust off your dancing shoes because the pop sensation is hitting the road after a five-year hiatus! The former NSYNC member announced his upcoming tour, entitled Forget Tomorrow World Tour, on the heels of his LP's lead single release called 'Selfish' on January 25.\nThe multi-talented singer, songwriter, and actor is hitting the stage with his signature blend of pop, R&B, and electrifying dance moves. With songs known for their infectious hooks coupled with Timberlake's stage presence, the Forget Tomorrow World Tour (which has dates spanning spring and summer in 2024) is set to be the highlight of this year's live music calendar.\nTickets went on presale on January 29 on Ticketmaster for those with JT Fan Club Presale codes. You can also hop on resale sites like StubHub and SeatGeek right now to buy, though most, if not all, will be upcharged from their original price tag.\nThe general public can also buy tickets through Timberlake's official website starting at 10 a.m. on February 2.Despite Britney Spears' fans hating on Timberlake after reading her memoir 'The Woman In Me,' which detailed the pair's tumultuous breakup and Timberlake's supposed unfair part in it, many still believe his 2024 concert series will be a highly anticipated one. So, if you're eyeing tickets, get ready.\nJustin Timberlake's Forget Tomorrow World Tour is scheduled to kick off this spring. Mark April 29, 2024, as the first show, which hits Vancouver, Canada. Fans from across the United States in cities like Phoenix, Seattle, Las Vegas, Atlanta, Miami, and New York (just to name a few) will also have the opportunity to experience the magic of Timberlake live in concert.\nHere are the announced dates:\nApril 29, 2024 - Rogers Arena in Vancouver, BC\nMay 2, 2024 - Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle, WA\nMay 6, 2024 - SAP Center at San Jose in San Jose, CA\nMay 10, 2024 - T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas, NV\nMay 14, 2024 - Pechanga Arena San Diego in San Diego, CA\nMay 17, 2024 - Kia Forum in Inglewood, CA\nMay 21, 2024 - Footprint Center in Phoenix, AZ\nMay 29, 2024 - Frost Bank Center in San Antonio, TX\nMay 31, 2024 - Moody Center in Austin, TX\nJune 4, 2024 - Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, TX\nJune 6, 2024 - BOK Center in Tulsa, OK\nJune 10, 2024 - State Farm Arena in Atlanta, GA\nJune 12, 2024 - PNC Arena in Raleigh, NC\nJune 14, 2024 - Amalie Arena in Tampa, FL\nJune 15, 2024 - Kaseya Center in Miami, FL\nJune 21, 2024 - United Center in Chicago, IL\nJune 25, 2024 - Madison Square Garden in New York, NY\nJune 29, 2024 - TD Garden in Boston, MA\nJuly 3, 2024 - CFG Bank Arena in Baltimore, MD\nJuly 4, 2024 - Hersheypark Stadium in Hershey, PA\nJuly 7, 2024 - Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse in Cleveland, OH\nJuly 9, 2024 - Rupp Arena in Lexington, KY\nIt's been reported that future tour dates will be announced for the United Kingdom and across Europe.\nPrices will vary by section, seat, and view.\nOn Ticketmaster, as far as we can tell, there are VIP packages ranging from $1,099 to $2,192. Non-VIP seats will obviously cost a lot less but will range based on the venue, date, and section.\nOn the resale site StubHub, for instance, the cheapest Justin Timberlake tickets are going for around $200 in the upper sections.\nIf you're eyeing seats on the floor, you can expect to spend upwards of $2,000 on StubHub right now. Keep in mind that these prices will fluctuate up and down based on demand and how resellers strategize.\nIf you don't want to pay top dollar, watch prices from day to day to gauge when's best for you to ultimately purchase.\nYou can expect to hear Timberlake's greatest hits along with tracks from his latest album, 'Everything I Thought I Was,\" which comes out March 15. His show will offer something for fans of all generations.\nYou'll likely get classics like \"SexyBack,\" \"Cry Me a River,\" and \"Mirrors,\" as well as fresh new tracks that showcase Timberlake's evolution as an artist.\nAnd, of course, the tour wouldn't be complete without Timberlake's signature dance moves and ballads. Prepare to be amazed as he and his talented crew light up the stage with their unmatched choreography and energy.\nAs far as a mini-reunion where NSYNC joins Timberlake on stage? That's sadly a long shot, but NSYNC fans can certainly dream. We ultimately doubt we'll see Timberlake with his former bandmates on his tour even though the group had a catchy song ('Better Place') from the 'Trolls Band Together' movie.\nTime to use those filters, JT fans! As you search for seats on ticket sale sites, you'll be able to toggle based on preferences like sections and prices.\nAs you select tickets, remember to take note of where the seats are in relation to the stage. To arm yourself with success, you can use AViewFromMySeat.com, which gives you user-generated photos of the venues from previous visits.\nHope you get the seats you want! Enjoy the show!\n\nNicole Richie's Surprising Adoption Story",

Whether Dolidze is looking to incite exchanges by initiating or countering in combination, the 35-year-old Georgian throws almost everything with fight-ending intentions.\nWhen feeling in stride, Dolidze will unleash some surprisingly fast and flashy kicks that he typically targets the head with. That said, Dolidze has also shown the ability to sneakily connect punches to kicks and knees off of the same side, particularly when looking to close distance in open-stance affairs.\nStill, closing the distance can be easier said than done when it comes to a fighter like Nassourdine Imavov.\nAlthough he appears to possess a natural aptitude for countering, Imavov also has a penchant for piecing together offense off of his lead hand.\nFrom active feints to sneaky hooks off of his jab, Imavov seems to have a solid sense of range that helps fuel his attacks. And when Imavov can corral his opposition toward the cage, the Russian-born fighter is not afraid to unleash everything from hooking combinations to flying knees.\nImavov also carries a lot of the defensive and standing swagger that you see from some of his other MMA Factory stablemates, which in turn helps his countering sensibilities.\nNevertheless, Imavov's low-handed guard and sometimes lackadaisical approach to offense have cost him both when coming forward (in the form of counters) and when going backward in extended exchanges (as Imavov's head will also go upright when retreating in straight lines).\nConsidering Dolidze's on-paper advantages and chaotic style, no one should be shocked if this party ends up on the floor at some point this Saturday.\nAlthough process and consistency aren't things that are typically synonymous with Dolidze's game, the Georgian fighter has displayed serviceable takedown tools in the past.\nDolidze is athletic enough for shot attempts in the open, but the 35-year-old pro appears to prefer working things out from the clinch.\nUtilizing his long limbs, Dolidze does well at either securing grips for takedown attempts or framing for devastating knees and strikes off the breaks. That said, Dolidze is not beyond being taken down or out-positioned himself \u2013 so don't sleep on Imavov in these spots.\nEven though the fighter from France has fewer attempts on the stat sheet (which can be deceiving given sample sizes), Imavov's offensive nature often finds himself flowing or crashing into clinch space.\nImavov will sometimes parlay this momentum into opportunistic level-changing takedown attempts that either score or allow him to secure his foes along the fence.\nImavov has seemingly absorbed a lot of the muay Thai swagger seen in a lot of Fernand Lopez fighters, so I wouldn't be surprised to see the 28-year-old utilize his solid framing game in close to land some vicious elbows and knees of his own. That said, I'm not sure how much he'll want to go strength-for-strength with a guy like Dolidze in closed quarters.\nAside from the finishes he's been accruing in said space, Dolidze is also the type of opportunistic grappler who will go for submissions in strange and unorthodox positions.\nNot afraid to invert his guard or drop for a leg, Dolidze's competence and confidence make for a dangerous dance partner in this division. Imavov may have a solid game from topside, but I'm not so sure he'll willingly want to try his luck with a customer like Dolidze.",

        "excerpt": "A powerful blizzard that closed highways and ski resorts had mostly moved through the Sierra Nevada by early Monday but forecasters warned that more snow was on the way for Northern California\u2026",
        "summary": "TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A powerful blizzard that closed highways and ski resorts had mostly moved through the Sierra Nevada by early Monday but forecasters warned that more snow was on the way for Northern California mountains.\nSections of Interstate 80 to the west and north of Lake Tahoe were still shut down late Sunday, with no estimate for reopening, the California Highway Patrol said.\nThe CHP office in South Lake Tahoe warned motorists that tire chains for improved traction are required on routes through the mountains, where more than 7 feet (2.1 meters) of snow fell over the weekend.\nBlizzard warnings had mostly expired but scattered thunderstorms were likely and another 2 feet (60 centimeters) of snow was possible at higher elevations, the National Weather Service office in Sacramento said.\n'Mountain travel is HIGHLY discouraged!' the office warned.\nThe multiday storm caused traffic backups and closures on I-80 and many other roadways, shut down ski resorts for two days, and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.\nBy Sunday night, Pacific Gas & Electric had restored electricity to all but about 4,400 Northern California customers, while NV Energy had reduced its outages to roughly 1,000 homes and businesses across the state line in Nevada.\nPalisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of the lake, was among several ski mountains that closed most or all chairlifts for a second straight day Sunday because of snow, wind and low visibility. Palisades reported a three-day snow total of 6 feet (1.8 meters), with more falling.\n'We will be digging out for the foreseeable future,' officials said on the resort's blog.\nKevin Dupui, who lives in Truckee, just northwest of Lake Tahoe, said his snow blower broke, but it doesn't really matter because there's nowhere to put all the snow anyway. 'We just move it around,' he said Sunday.\nDupui said residents and tourists seem to be mostly heeding warnings to stay home. 'The roads haven't been that safe, so we don't really want people driving around,' he said.\nAnother Truckee resident, Jenelle Potvin, said at first some cynical locals thought 'there was a little too much hype' made about the approaching storm. But then the unrelenting snow began Friday night.\n'It was definitely a blizzard. And we woke up to a lot of snow yesterday and it never let up,' Potvin said Sunday. Her neighbors were snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in the streets.\nIn the eastern Sierra, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area was closed Sunday as winds of up to 70 mph (113 kph) made it too difficult for ski patrol to complete avalanche mitigation, the resort said. More than 3 feet (nearly 1 meter) of snow fell over three days, and more was on the way.\nWeather service meteorologist William Churchill on Saturday called the storm an 'extreme blizzard' for the Sierra Nevada but said he didn't expect records to be broken.\nThe storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A widespread blizzard warning through Sunday morning covered a 300-mile (480-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring additional rain and snow between Monday and Wednesday, forecasters said.\nCalifornia authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of 'spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.' There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.\nRudy Islas spent about 40 minutes shoveling his car out before heading to work at a coffee shop in Truckee on Sunday morning. Neither he nor his customers were fazed by the snow, he said.\n'To be honest, if you're a local, it's not a big deal,' he said. 'I think a lot of people are used to the snow and they prepare for it.'\n___\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

        "summary": "TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A major highway was closed and ski resorts were shut down Sunday as the effects of a powerful blizzard continued to cause problems across the Sierra Nevada, and forecasters warned that more heavy snow was on the way for Northern California.\nSections of Interstate 80 to the west and north of Lake Tahoe were made impassable by blowing snow piling up in lanes, with no estimate for reopening, the California Highway Patrol said.\nThe CHP office in South Lake Tahoe warned motorists that tire chains for improved traction are required on routes through the mountains, where more than 7 feet (2.1 meters) of snow fell over the weekend. The online warning Sunday was accompanied by a photo of a big rig without chains stuck in whiteout conditions on a local road.\n'Trying to bypass chain control, no no no!!\" the agency said on X, formerly Twitter. 'Dangerous and not smart.'\nA blizzard warning was in effect until midnight for some areas above 6,500 feet (1,980 meters), while lower elevations were under a winter storm warning with another 2 feet (60 centimeters) of snow possible, the National Weather Service office in Sacramento said. 'Mountain travel is HIGHLY discouraged!' the office warned.\nThe multiday storm caused traffic backups and closures on I-80 and many other roadways, shut down ski resorts and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.\nBy Sunday evening, Pacific Gas & Electric had restored electricity to all but about 4,800 Northern California customers, while NV Energy had reduced its outages to roughly 1,000 homes and businesses across the state line in Nevada.\nPalisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of the lake and site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, was among several ski mountains that closed most or all chairlifts for a second straight day Sunday because of snow, wind and low visibility. Palisades reported a three-day snow total of 6 feet (1.8 meters), with more falling.\n'We will be digging out for the foreseeable future,' officials said on the resort's blog.\nKevin Dupui, who lives in Truckee, just northwest of Lake Tahoe, said his snow blower broke, but it doesn't really matter because there's nowhere to put all the snow anyway. 'We just move it around,' he said Sunday.\nDupui said residents and tourists seem to be mostly heeding warnings to stay home. 'The roads haven't been that safe, so we don't really want people driving around,' he said.\nAnother Truckee resident, Jenelle Potvin, said at first some cynical locals thought 'there was a little too much hype' made about the approaching storm. But then the unrelenting snow began Friday night.\n'It was definitely a blizzard. And we woke up to a lot of snow yesterday and it never let up,' Potvin said Sunday. Her neighbors were snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in the streets. \"But, yeah, we went from 0 to 100 pretty fast.'\nIn the eastern Sierra, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area was closed Sunday as winds of up to 70 mph (113 kph) made it too difficult for ski patrol to complete avalanche mitigation, the resort said. More than 3 feet (nearly 1 meter) of snow fell over three days, and more was on the way.\nWeather service meteorologist William Churchill on Saturday called the storm an 'extreme blizzard' for the Sierra Nevada but said he didn't expect records to be broken.\nThe storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A widespread blizzard warning through Sunday morning covered a 300-mile (480-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring additional rain and snow between Monday and Wednesday, forecasters said.\nCalifornia authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of 'spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.' There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.\nRudy Islas spent about 40 minutes shoveling his car out before heading to work at a coffee shop in Truckee on Sunday morning. Neither he nor his customers were fazed by the snow, he said.\n'To be honest, if you're a local, it's not a big deal,' he said. 'I think a lot of people are used to the snow and they prepare for it.'\n___\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

        "summary": "When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more\nThe tribe has spoken. The new season of Survivor is underway, and there are a couple of different ways that you can tune in. Below, we'll teach you where to watch Survivor live and on-demand throughout the new season.\nThe long-running survival competition reality series, hosted by Jeff Probst, returns for its 46th season on CBS. Episodes air Wednesday nights, and each week promises a new set of heart-pounding adventures for the 18 contestants castaway on the islands of Fiji. In a historic move, the first two episodes will be two hours long, and the rest of the season's episodes will clock in at 90 minutes each. We'll give you all of the necessary details on the new season, including how to watch it live.\nSo far, David Jelinsky (a slot machine salesman from Las Vegas, NV) has been eliminated from Season 46. He was in the Yanu tribe and was unanimously voted off in the season premiere. Keep reading to learn who's still in the competition.\nUSA: Paramount Plus, Fubo (free trial), YouTube TV, Hulu + Live TV\nCanada: Global TV\nAccess your US/CA subscriptions from overseas via\u00a0ExpressVPN\n\n\"Scorpio Energy\" March 6, 8 p.m. ET\n\"Wackadoodles Win\" March 13, 8 p.m. ET\n\"Don't Touch the Oven\" March 20, 8 p.m. ET\nSurvivor airs on CBS at 8 p.m. ET in the USA. If you don't have access to basic cable, you can live stream the episodes through Paramount Plus. The live-streaming option comes with the Paramount Plus with Showtime subscription tier, which goes for $11.99 per month. All Paramount Plus subscriptions, including Paramount Plus Essential, will have access to new episodes the day after they premiere. The streaming service also includes the entire back-catalog of all 45 past Survivor seasons.\nIf you're looking for more options for live TV that includes CBS, you can try out one of the cable alternative packages like Fubo. Fubo plans begin at $79.99 per month (with an introductory month at $20 off) and include a one-week free trial. Hulu + Live TV also includes CBS in its packages. Subscriptions for Hulu + Live TV start at $76.99 per month.\nSurvivor is available to live stream on Global TV at 8 p.m. ET in Canada. Global TV also features episodes from Season 45, which you can access by logging in through your cable provider.\nIf you're unable to access live streams of Survivor in your region right now, you can use a VPN (virtual private network) to change the country that your electronic device is currently associated with in order to access relevant websites and apps that way. VPNs also help boost your online security and privacy. Using this method, you should be able to use your existing live TV package from overseas and watch Survivor. You need a US payment form to sign up for these packages, so this strategy is best for people from the US who are just out of the country and want to keep up with their regular programming.\nWe recommend ExpressVPN, an easy-to-use virtual private network with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can read more about it in our ExpressVPN review and learn how to use it below.\nSign up for a\u00a0VPN\u00a0if you don't already have one.\nInstall it on the device you're planning to watch Survivor on.\nTurn it on and set it to a US location.\nSign up for one of the live TV streaming packages with a US form of payment.\nSelect the CBS channel and enjoy the new episode.\nSurvivor released an official Season 46 preview ahead of the premiere, but it has since been removed from public view on YouTube. The show just dropped a preview of the new episode, which shows some of the interpersonal dynamics of the contestants. Note that this trailer is only viewable in the US unless you switch a VPN on. Check it out below:\nSurvivor season 46 will showcase 18 contestants split amongst three tribes.

        "excerpt": "As we approach Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, fans attempt to predict the score with simulations.",
        "summary": "With Super Bowl 58 just around the corner, several NFL fans are looking for ways to predict the result of the impending game. Several publications have released their simulations for the 2024 Super Bowl between the Kansas City Chiefs and the San Francisco 49ers.\nWhile these simulations are supposed to create a realistic outcome, oftentimes, they just become something fun to consider during the week leading up to the big game \u2013 or something to give fans of either team false hope before their dreams get decimated.\nThe most popular form of simulation is through the video game Madden. Madden is the only simulation-style NFL video game and thus makes it an easily attainable method for conducting such simulations. Here are some of the best from around the internet.\n\nMadden: Chiefs 30, 49ers 28\nThe official Madden 24 simulation saw the Chiefs take down the 49ers. When the Chiefs and 49ers squared off in 2020, Madden also predicted a Chiefs' victory and was correct. However, neither team is where they were four years ago. Madden's official simulation has not correctly predicted the Super Bowl winner in three straight years.\nCBS Sports: 49ers 10, Chiefs 6\nThis score would be a shocker given the effectiveness of the 49ers offense as well as the greatness of Patrick Mahomes. Still, with the Chiefs' defense playing as well as it has, a low-scoring affair could very well be on the docket.\nCBS's simulation predicts that a late interception from former Kansas City Chief Charvarius Ward will seal the Chiefs' fate. Ward will win Super Bowl MVP for his performance.\nSports Illustrated: Chiefs 24, 49ers 21\nSports Illustrated did not use Madden to run their simulations, opting for a computer model to predict the score instead. Luke Lindholm writes that the computer leaned toward the Chiefs because of their performance in recent games compared to the 49ers. Where the 49ers showed flashes of greatness in the second half of their conference championship and divisional round games, the Chiefs have looked dominant throughout the entirety of their games in these playoffs.\nLindholm also notes that the Chiefs have distinct advantages at quarterback and on defense. The 49ers' defense has been exposed up front against elite offenses throughout the year. While they were able to control the Dallas Cowboys, the Detroit Lions and Baltimore Ravens have been able to poke holes in the Niners' front seven.\nHistorically, Madden has been right more often than it has been wrong, with a record of 11-9 since the official simulations started prior to Super Bowl 38. However, Madden has endured a rough stretch as of late, going 1-5 in the last six Super Bowls. In all fairness, the one game that Madden has correctly predicted in that span was the Chiefs vs. 49ers in 2020.\nPrior to that, Madden's last correct prediction came in Super Bowl 51 between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons. Madden predicted a three-point victory for New England. Crazily enough, Madden has actually predicted the exact score of the Super Bowl before. The video game predicted a 28-24 victory for the Patriots over the Seattle Seahawks, which ended up being the correct score. Madden did not predict the massive interception at the end of the game, but for a simulation to come that close is still a remarkable feat.\nWhen:\u00a0Sunday, February 11, 2024\nWhere:\u00a0Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, NV\nTime:\u00a06:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT\nTV:\u00a0CBS, Nickelodeon\nStream: YouTube TV, Fubo TV, Paramount+\nStream the game: Watch Super Bowl 58 with Fubo\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

In the initial distribution, Ault Alliance stockholders received forty (40) shares of TurnOnGreen common stock and warrants to purchase forty (40) shares of TurnOnGreen common stock (the \"TOG Securities\") and in the second distribution, stockholders of the Company received fifteen (15) TOG Securities for each share of common stock of the Company that they owned on the record date.\nThe Company distributed 58,686,480 TOG Securities in the initial distribution and another 56,405,175 TOG Securities in the second distribution, for an aggregate of 115,091,655 TOG Securities distributed, leaving another 24,908,345 TOG Securities to be distributed in the Final Distribution.\nThe Company has set a record date of April 15, 2024 (the \"Record Date\") and a payment date of April 29, 2024 (the \"Payment Date\") for the Final Distribution, in each case subject to adjustment.\nBased on the estimated number of shares of common stock of the Company (the \"AAI Common Stock\") to be issued and outstanding on the Record Date, each stockholder of the Company will receive approximately 0.71 TOG Securities for each share of AAI Common Stock owned on the Record Date.\nBased on the closing price of AAI Common Stock of $0.3669 as of the COB on Thursday, March 21, 2024, the market value of the 0.71 shares of TurnOnGreen common stock and warrants to purchase 0.71 shares of TurnOnGreen common stock would result in a dividend of approximately $0.019 per share of AAI Common Stock.\nThe Company will not issue fractional shares in connection with the Final Distribution. Stockholders who would otherwise hold fractional shares because the number of shares of AAI Common Stock they hold before the Final Distribution is not evenly divisible by the ratio you will be entitled to receive a cash payment (without interest and subject to applicable withholding taxes) from our exchange agent handling the Final Distribution (the \"Distribution Agent\") in lieu of such fractional shares.

The sale of all fractional interests will be effected by the Distribution Agent as soon as practicable after the Payment Date on the basis of prevailing market prices of the TurnOnGreen common stock at the time of sale. After such sale, the Distribution Agent will pay to such holders of record their pro rata share of the net proceeds (after customary brokerage commissions and other expenses) derived from the sale of the fractional interests.\nThe registration statement related to the distributions of the TOG Securities has been declared effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\"We are pleased to complete the Final Distribution to our stockholders,\" said Milton C. Ault, the Company's Executive Chairman. He added that \"We believe that we have now demonstrated to not only our stockholders but to the public in general that we have fulfilled our publicly issued commitment regarding the TOG Securities.

The company also owns and operates MEXPLAY, a regulated online casino in Mexico.\nOur sophisticated software automatically declines any gaming or redemption requests from within the United States, in strict compliance with current US law.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA, which is disclosed above, is a 'non-GAAP financial measure' presented as a supplemental measure of the Company's performance. Adjusted EBITDA is not presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, or GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and also excludes stock-based compensation expense. Adjusted EBITDA is presented because we believe it provides additional useful information to investors due to the various non-cash items during the period. Adjusted EBITDA is not recognized in accordance with GAAP, is unaudited, and has limitations as an analytical tool, and you should not consider it in isolation, or as substitutes for analysis of the Company's results as reported under GAAP. Some of these limitations are: Adjusted EBITDA does not re\ufb02ect cash expenditures, or future requirements for capital expenditures, or contractual commitments; Adjusted EBITDA does not re\ufb02ect changes in, or cash requirements for, working capital needs; Adjusted EBITDA does not re\ufb02ect the signi\ufb01cant interest expense, or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments, on debt or cash income tax payments; although depreciation and amortization are non-cash charges, the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future, and Adjusted EBITDA does not re\ufb02ect any cash requirements for such replacements; and other companies in this industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than the Company does, limiting its usefulness as a comparative measure. The Company's presentation of these measures should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or nonrecurring items. For more information on these non-GAAP \ufb01nancial measures, please see the section titled 'Reconciliation of Net Income (loss) attributable to Golden Matrix Group, Inc., to Adjusted Earnings excluding Interest Expense, Interest Income, Amortization Expense and Stock-based Compensation Expense' included at the end of this release.\nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\nCertain statements made in this press release contain forward-looking information within the meaning of applicable securities laws, including within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 ('forward-looking statements').

        "clean_url": "yahoo.com",
        "excerpt": "Here is an update from UC beat reporter Scott Springer and Xavier beat reporter Shelby Dermer on NCAA tournament chances for the Bearcats, Musketeers",
        "summary": "With Selection Sunday just a month away on St. Patrick's Day, The Enquirer takes another look at the postseason scenarios for the Cincinnati Bearcats and Xavier Musketeers.\nAgain, both squads have a lot of work in front of them. The Bearcats just dropped consecutive home games to a pair of Top 10 teams with swarming defenses, Houston and Iowa State. Xavier is coming off its own two-game losing streak, falling to No. 19 Creighton at Cintas Center and unranked Seton Hall on the road.\n\nHere's a look at where tournament prospects stand for Wes Miller's Bearcats and Sean Miller's Musketeers:\nLast season, UC had a single Quadrant 1 win which came on the road in a buzzer-beater against UCF. That was while playing an American Athletic Conference schedule. The Bearcats were bypassed and eventually finished with an NCAA NET ranking of 70 and a 23-13 record after being ousted in the quarterfinals of the NIT.\nThis season, entering Saturday's game at UCF, the Bearcats are 2-6 in Quad 1 games, 2-2 in Quad 2, 3-1 in Quad 3 and 8-0 in Quad 4. The NET and KenPom.com both put them at No. 36 meaning statically they're among the top 68 teams.\nThe Big 12 tournament is March 12-16 in Kansas City. If they can't get a Top 10 seed, all the Bearcats would have to do is win five games in five days in what many say is the best league in basketball. Heading into Saturday, UC, UCF, West Virginia and Oklahoma State would be seeds Nos. 11-14.\nEven if the Bearcats catapult to the Top 10, they would have to play four games in four days. The top two seeds, first place Houston and Iowa State as of this writing, would have to win only three games to win the tournament.\nEntering this week, ESPN bracketologist Joe Lunardi had UC among the first four out in his calculations. Keep in mind, automatic bids of weaker leagues and Power Five/Group of Five tournament upsets affect who cheers, who looks to host an NIT game or who calls it a season.\nJerry Palm at CBS  also puts UC in the first four out with nine other Big 12 teams in the field, same as Lunardi.\nMike DeCourcy of Fox  puts the Bearcats among the last four in making them the 10th of the Big 12 teams to qualify.\nIf you take your C-Paw hat off, it would be fair to says that UC would be favored in three, possibly four of their seven remaining games. They are 15-9 (4-7 Big 12).\nAt UCF: Possibly favored, but probably not.\nOklahoma State: Should be favored but the Cowboys do have two conference wins.\nAt TCU: Probably not favored, though UC did beat them when they were No. 19 in Cincinnati.\nAt Houston: Not favored because Houston has won the last 10 between the teams.\nKansas State: Should be favored since it's home, but the Wildcats have five conference wins.\nAt Oklahoma: UC had them beat here, but lost. They won't be favored in Norman.\nWest Virginia: Should be favored as it's Senior Day and quite frankly they owe them one.\nOn the lower end UC, if playing to its potential, could wind up 18-13 and 7-11 in the Big 12. Optimistically, they would have to win a game they weren't favored in to reach 19 or 20 wins or get near .500 in the league.\nDue to the recent inconsistency, 18 overall wins and 7-11 in the league seems more likely. There is a precedent in making the tournament with a 7-11 Big 12 mark though as that's where West Virginia finished last season earning a No. 9 seed. However, that Bob Huggins team had six Quad 1 wins. UC would have to find some Quad 1 wins in the remaining menu as they come into this weekend's play with just two.\nShould the Bearcats find a way to finish the last seven 5-2, a 9-9 Big 12 record would surely secure a bid. In all likelihood that would involve UC snaring at least three of the four upcoming road games.\nThis time last year, Xavier was coming off back-to-back Big East losses by a combined three points to Butler and Marquette on the road. By then, however, Xavier was No. 16 in the AP poll and had already racked up an impressive NCAA Tournament resume that included a regular-season sweep of the eventual national-champion UConn Huskies.\n\nFast forward a year and this year's Xavier club has work to do. The Musketeers are 2-8 in Quad 1 games (wins over St. Mary's in Las Vegas and at Providence), 5-1 mark in Quad 2 games, 1-2 in Quad 3 contests and 5-0 in Quad 4. Xavier fell to No. 45 in KenPom and No. 57 in the NET following Wednesday's setback to Seton Hall.\nYou don't need a magnifying glass to notice a three-team log jam in the middle of the Big East standings. Xavier (13-12, 7-7 Big East) is part of a three-way tie for the No. 5 spot in the conference, a coveted position given that the top-5 teams in the conference are granted first-round byes in the Big East Tournament in Madison Square Garden next month.\nThe good news? Xavier has already beaten the two teams they are tied with: Butler (16-9, 7-7) and Providence (16-9, 7-7). The bad news? Both the Bulldogs and Friars have two more Quad 1 victories than the Musketeers. Xavier still has a shot at each of those teams when Providence visits Cintas Center Feb. 21 and Xavier travels to Hinkle Fieldhouse March 6. Both matchups will carry weight in a battle for the fifth spot, but it's fair to say it's not just a three-team race with Villanova (6-7 in Big East) and St. John's (6-8) within striking distance.\nEven if Xavier were to get a first-round bye in Manhattan, they'd have to run the table in a field that includes the top-4 teams in the conference that have separated themselves from the pack. Xavier is a combined 1-5 against No. 1 UConn, No. 17 Creighton and Seton Hall and has yet to play No. 4 Marquette.\nAfter beating Villanova, Xavier had climbed to the \"Last Four Out\" spot in ESPN's Bracketology. That's the best position they've been in this year, but it was quickly followed up with back-to-back losses. Joe Lunardi now has the Musketeers missing the tournament and has four Big East schools (Seton Hall, St. John's, Villanova and Providence) higher on the bubble, but also missing March Madness. Lunardi has Butler as one of the last four teams to receive an at-large bid.\nPalm (CBS ) and DeCourcy (Fox ) each have Xavier missing the tournament.\nUsing the projected final scores from KenPom, Xavier should be a favorite in three of its final six games. Of the three underdog matchups remaining, two are against the No. 4 Golden Eagles, who Xavier will play twice in a 13-day span starting Feb. 25 at Fiserv Forum in Milwaukee. Xavier has just a 20% chance of beating Marquette on the road, according to KenPom, its lowest winning percentage of any game remaining. Xavier is a projected short underdog in its final two regular-season games at Butler and at home against Marquette.\nvs. Providence (KenPom's final score): Xavier 73, Providence 69\nat Marquette: Marquette 80, Xavier 71\nvs. DePaul: Xavier 85, DePaul 63\nat Georgetown: Xavier 82, Georgetown 73\nat Butler: Butler 79, Xavier 75\nvs. Marquette: Marquette 77, Xavier 75\nThe Musketeers are projected to finish the regular season 16-15 and 10-10 in conference play. Does that get you to a top-5 seed in the Big East Tournament? Well, that's why they play the games. Every team in the middle of the Big East standings has struggled to stay consistent. If those projections hold, Xavier wouldn't add to its Quad 1 win count, the Musketeers desperately need to pull out an outright win as an underdog or two.\nXavier has struggled with consistency. It's expected for a team with 10 new players and only one returner from a Sweet 16 run. But the Musketeers, by hook or by crook, are in the conversation for an NCAA Tournament berth, something that seemed highly unlikely if you rewind to non-conference play, when Xavier suffered two Quad 3 losses (Delaware, Oakland) in an eight-day stretch.\nXavier's not an NCAA Tournament team right now and would have to pull off some quality wins after its off weekend. There's no way of knowing how the final half-dozen games will shake out, but a fair prediction right now is to say Xavier would need to surprise some teams in the Big East Tournament to get a ticket to the dance.\nThis article originally appeared on Cincinnati Enquirer: Updating March Madness hopes for Cincinnati Bearcats, Xavier Muskies",

        "summary": "Special Counsel David Weiss has charged a former FBI informant with lying about U.S. President Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden's involvement in business dealings with Ukrainian energy company Burisma Holdings, CNN reported on Feb. 15.\nAlexander Smirnov, 43, is facing charges in connection with lying to the FBI and creating false records. He was arrested on Feb. 15 at Harry Reid International Airport in Las Vegas, after his arrival in the US from overseas, and will make his initial appearance in federal court the same afternoon.\nRead also: \u2018Probably after the war' \u2014 Ukraine won't be invited to join NATO this year \u2014 U.S. State Department\nThe charges undercut a key linchpin of the Republican impeachment case against the President.\nThe indictment alleges that Smirnov's story to the FBI 'was a fabrication, an amalgam of otherwise unremarkable business meetings and contacts that had actually occurred, but at a later date than he claimed, and for the purpose of pitching Burisma on the Defendant's services and products, not for discussing bribes to [Joe Biden] when he was in office.'\nCongressional Republicans have uncritically championed Smirnov's now-discredited allegations for roughly a year and they fought with the FBI to obtain memos detailing what Smirnov told investigators. They later released the materials publicly, over the FBI's objections.\nRead also: SBU and SBI search Dubinsky's residence in state treason case \u2014 NV sources\nRepublicans have repeatedly praised Smirnov as 'credible' and put his uncorroborated claims front-and-center in their impeachment inquiry into the President.\nWhile announcing the impeachment inquiry, then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said 'a trusted FBI informant has alleged a bribe to the Biden family.'\nThe collapse of Smirnov's story is a major blow to Republican narratives about the Biden family.\n'For months we have warned that Republicans have built their conspiracies about Hunter and his family on lies told by people with political agendas, not facts,' said Abbe Lowell, Hunter Biden's lawyer, in a statement to CNN.\nDuring Biden's campaign for the Presidency, Smirnov allegedly submitted reports to the FBI about two meetings with Burisma executives from 2015 and 2016, during which the executives admitted that they hired Hunter Biden to 'protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.'\nRead also: NATO to provide Ukraine with one million UAVs in 2024\nSmirnov also allegedly reported that executives paid $5 million each to Joe and Hunter Biden while Joe Biden was Vice President so that Hunter would 'take care of all those issues through his dad,' referring to a criminal investigation being conducted by the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General into Burisma.\n'In truth and fact, the Defendant had contact with executives from Burisma in 2017, after the end of the Obama-Biden Administration and after the then-Ukrainian Prosecutor General had been fired in February 2016. In other words, when [Joe Biden] had no ability to influence U.S. policy and when the Prosecutor General was no longer in office,' the indictment states.\nBurisma is a privately owned Ukrainian gas production group. It is the country's only vertically integrated holding company engaged in the exploration, production, service, and sale of hydrocarbons. Burisma Group is one of the three largest independent gas producers in Ukraine and is headquartered in Cyprus.\nOn June 12, 2020, Mykola Ilyashenko, the Kyiv Tax Service's first deputy head, Andriy Kicha, Burisma's chief legal officer, and another trustee of former Ecology Minister Mykola Zlochevskyi, Burisma's owner, were detained.\nAccording to law enforcement, Zlochevskyi attempted to pay a bribe of $6 million to the then-head of the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office (SAPO) Nazar Kholodnytskyi, and the-then head of National Anti-Corruption Agency of Ukraine (NABU) Artem Sytnyk. SAPO and NABU were pursuing a criminal case against Zlochevskyi at the time, involving embezzling funds from the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) stabilization loan program.\nRead also: \u2018Everywhere is full of dead Russians' \u2014 CNN reporter stunned after his trip to the frontlines\nZlochevskyi was served with a notice of suspicion in July 2020 and arrested in absentia by the Supreme Anti-Corruption Court.\nHe left Ukraine in late 2014 when he received the status of a suspect in the case of illicit enrichment. In January 2015, the Prosecutor General's Office put him on the wanted list.

        "excerpt": "Cheers to afternoon tea! Check out some of our favorite state-side spots to snack on cucumber sandwiches and enjoy the restful British tradition.",
        "summary": "Rooted in the 19th-century English aristocracy, the practice of afternoon tea \u2013- which starts with finger sandwiches, transitions to scones with clotted cream and jam, and finishes with elaborate pastries \u2013- has gracefully traversed the Atlantic and garnered a warm welcome across the diverse landscapes of the United States.\nThe beauty of afternoon tea lies not only in the delectable offerings but also in the ritual accompanying it. As the fragrant steam rises from a carefully-brewed teapot, one is transported to a world where time slows down, thus allowing for the appreciation of life's simple pleasures. Tea rooms and hotels have embraced this quintessentially British tradition and infused it with its own unique charm. And since America is a melting pot of cultures, you can also find plenty of afternoon tea spots that have nothing to do with the Brits and instead pay homage to the fine tea traditions present in countries like Russia and Japan. So, let's take a look at which establishments provide the best afternoon tea experiences across the U.S., based on personal experience and professional and Google reviews.\n\nAfternoon tea at The Plaza might just be the pinnacle of the classic tea experience on this side of the Atlantic. You can choose menu options ranging from the Manhattan Tea, Plaza Signature Tea, or, for the little ones, the Eloise Tea, named after the children's books.\nEach menu will have all the trappings of a fine English afternoon tea, all served in the grand setting of the Palm Court. The tea selection is courtesy of Palais des Th\u00e9s, but there is also plenty of bubbly on hand -- otherwise, it wouldn't be proper afternoon tea. Expect typical finger sandwiches with a twist, like a trusty cucumber with mint labneh, tarragon, and pickled mustard seeds.\n\n(212) 546-5303\n768 5th Ave, New York, NY 10019\nIf you're after a traditional British setting for your afternoon tea, this is not quite it, but it should also not be dismissed. The signature tea experience comes with a wooden box containing glass vials of tea, from which you can choose the special blend you want to try.\nBut mostly, you'll want to go for the seasonal afternoon tea menu devised to suit holidays or special events, such as the Lunar New Year afternoon tea. Either way, you'll be treated to exquisite TEALEAVES tea tailor-made to suit the St. Regis' high standards, with options including Pu-Erh Tou Cha, Imperial Dragonwell, Organic Jasmine Pearl, or Iron Goddess of Mercy.\n\n(415) 284-4188\n125 3rd St, San Francisco, CA 94105\nAfternoon tea is all about old-world pleasures. It helps us imagine we're in a faraway land from long ago, living the life of an aristocratic figure. Surely, drinking tea must be what they did all day. Luckily, Charleston, with its genteel Southern ways, is the perfect setting to facilitate this type of imaginative play. Such is especially true at\u00a0Camellias, located in the Hotel Bennett.\nThe champagne lounge is an ideal spot for afternoon tea, also because what better drink is there than bubbly to kick off such an event? Just don't dress in pink from head to toe, or you might end up blending into your surroundings -- never to be seen again.\n\n(843) 990-5460\n404 King St, Charleston, SC 29403\nWhile most afternoon tea events are tranquil and sometimes subdued affairs, the Tipsy Tea Party at the Gwen Hotel in Chicago is anything but. First of all, as the name suggests, the booze takes center stage, although the tea remains an integral part of the afternoon. Second, and most shockingly, there is also a live DJ present in the room.\nThe most fun part, though, is the cocktails. Unlike your usual afternoon tea, which comes with a glass of sparkling wine to kick things off, the Tipsy Tea Party provides you with a whole host of fun tea-based cocktails to choose from, such as the Getaway Car: a warm and fuzzy combination of bourbon, lemon, and oolong tea.\n\n(312) 645-1500\n521 N Rush St, Chicago, IL 60611\nA hotel named The Windsor Court is bound to evoke the aristocratic feel of a proper afternoon tea. Aside from the royal name, the decor is traditionally English with a touch of Southern charm, and live harp or piano music can be heard at any given time.\nExpect the afternoon to unfold in an equally traditional way. Tea begins with a glass of sparkling wine or a light cocktail, followed by your tea of choice, along with finger sandwiches. Next in line are the scones, which can be enjoyed with cream and jam, and finally, a selection of sophisticated desserts. Up the ante by choosing one of many themed teas, like the Mad Hatter or Mardi Gras teas.\n\n(504) 596-4773\n300 Gravier St, New Orleans, LA 70130\nIf you don't think you'll have time to grab dinner before your show at nearby Carnegie Hall, afternoon tea at the Russian Tea Room is the ideal option. That way, you can while away the afternoon and take time your time to enjoy your meal without having to rush to catch the next showtime.\nFounded in 1927 by members of the Russian Imperial Ballet, this iconic establishment has been going strong for almost 100 years, serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner in addition to afternoon tea. This might also be one of the few places where you can add caviar to your uniquely Russian tea experience.\n\n(212) 581-7100\n150 W 57th St, New York, NY 10019\nBritish cuisine may not be as well-known as Asian or Indian food. But that has changed very much over the years with the rise of the British gastropub and, of course, the proliferation of afternoon tea.\u00a0The Dandelion in Philadelphia does both meals well, especially when enjoyed in its beautiful Victorian-style dining room.\nOrder the traditional afternoon tea experience with the typical sandwiches, scones, and pastries -- also known as A Royal Occasion. Or you can keep it light and simple by just ordering the sandwiches -- or sticking to the pastries. The tea selection is short but sweet, courtesy of Teapigs.\n\n(215) 558-2500\n124 S 18th St, Philadelphia, PA 19103\nAlthough afternoon tea can easily be made entirely vegetarian -- as it's often\u00a0made up of cucumber sandwiches and meat-free pastries anyway -- it hardly ever is. This is not the case for the Willard Peacock Alley Tea at the Hotel Intercontinental in Washington, D.C., where there is a delightful vegetarian afternoon tea menu, as well as options for a vegan-only or omnivorous affair.\u00a0The various teas are provided by the J'enwey Tea Company and the scones are baked fresh every day.\nSipping tea at the Williard is an afternoon treat dating back to the 1920s. Snacking on sandwiches and enjoying the company of your friends will make you feel like you're stepping back into history.\n\n(202) 942-7010\n1401 Pennsylvania Ave NW, Washington, DC 20004\nWhile most afternoon teas are technically three-course affairs -- between the sandwiches, scones, and pastries -- the one at Lady Mendl's Tea Salon is a whopping five courses. The additional dishes consist of soup or salad to start, then crep\u00eas served between the scones and the pastries.\nIf you still have room after all of this, plus the requisite tea, start the afternoon with a fine glass of sparkling wine or a cocktail with a whimsical name, like the Butterfly Effect or the Rose Petal Fizz. This is the ideal spot and menu for a restful afternoon event with friends or a low-key baby shower.\n\n(212) 533-4600\n56 Irving Pl, New York, NY 10003\nIf you can only pick one place for afternoon tea while in Los Angeles, let it be the Living Room at the Peninsula Hotel Beverly Hills. While many establishments that offer afternoon tea only do so on the weekend, the Living Room offers this service every day of the week.\nThis location takes afternoon tea very seriously. The sandwiches, to start, amp up traditional fare by adding exquisite new ingredients, like caviar on the smoked salmon sandwich or mint and pumpernickel bread to the cucumber sandwich. And the pastries are just as ingenious, including the decadent three chocolate cake or the peanut caramel cupcake.\n\n(310) 551-2888\n9882 S Santa Monica Blvd, Beverly Hills, CA 90212\nDenver may be more closely associated with the historic lawlessness of the Wild West than the civility of an afternoon tea. But times have changed, and the Brown Palace can whip up as good an afternoon tea as any the King might enjoy back in Britain. In fact, the Devonshire cream provided with a plate of Brown Palace's scones comes directly from merry England.\nEven so, many ingredients used to prepare the food are local and seasonal, including the honey, which comes from the hotel's rooftop bee colonies. Order the Brown Palace Signature Tea for a booze-free option, or go for the teas that come with Chandon or Veuve Clicquot Champagnes.\n\n(303) 297-3111\n321 17th St, Denver, CO 80202\nAfternoon tea is a relaxed affair, which is why it works well with the vibe of the Courtyard Tea Room inside the Boston Public Library -- which we consider one of the most relaxing places on Earth. You hardly notice that you're actually in the city's bustling center.\nOrder your tea from a vast selection of high-quality varieties and complement it with a craft cocktail, as this establishment provides some exciting propositions. The Perfect Pair will complete your tea dreams with its house-made matcha liquor, matcha powder, and coconut creme, while the Snowbird will keep you bright and spritely with its mandarin-infused bourbon, orange cranberry sugar water, Disaronno Amaretto, fresh lime juice, and ginger beer.\n\n(781) 763-1360\n700 Boylston St, Boston, MA 02116\nThis afternoon tea experience is out of this world -- not just because the fare is incredible. While themed afternoon teas abound, especially for children, many of them tend to be Disney-related or inspired by literature. Finally, Emperor Georgiu's Tea Room \u2013- which is a queer, black, and neurodivergent-owned business -\u2013 brings us a Star Trek-inspired afternoon tea.\nAs you can imagine, this is not your typical afternoon tea experience. This tea room, which is named after a Star Trek character, offers the Emperor's Tea service -- which includes a bottomless pot of tea, toasted crumpets, a chai spice scone, sage and white bean finger sandwich, and pear upside-down cake. Diners can also substitute items for vegan or gluten-free selections.\n\n(503) 567-7888\n8237 N Denver Ave, Portland, OR 97217\nIf you need to get away from the incessant kitsch of Las Vegas, head to the elegant Tea Lounge at the Waldorf Astoria for one of the most sophisticated dining experiences in Las Vegas. Afternoon tea is available every day on the 23rd floor of the building, which offers beautiful views of the city.\nA typical afternoon tea here will come with freshly brewed loose-leaf tea, a host of innovative finger sandwiches, including the curry chicken sandwich on curry turmeric bread or the porchetta with mustard relish mayo on multigrain bread, fresh scones, and petit fours that are as pretty to look at as they are good to eat.\n\n(702) 590-8888\n3752 Las Vegas Blvd S, Las Vegas, NV 89158\nEnjoy a stately afternoon tea at Gracie's in Portland. The interior features intricate crown molding, elaborate chandeliers, and other sophisticated touches. The restaurant also offers some very fine custom-blended teas that you won't find anywhere else.\nThere's the Portland Breakfast, which is as strong as its English counterpart but includes hints of spice and peat. Or there's the Silent Night for those seeking a caffeine-free experience and, indeed, a very silent and restful night. This blend leans heavily into the peppermint flavors, which perfectly match the subdued elements of cinnamon, ginger, and licorice. Oregonian wines are deployed to provide the perfect pairing for the scones, savory sandwiches, and other offerings.\n\n(503) 222-2171\n729 SW 15th Ave, Portland, OR 97205\nGiven the upscale feel of Orange County, it's hardly a surprise that great spots for afternoon tea abound. The Tea House on Los Rios, located in San Juan Capistrano, is one of these top spots. This family-run operation is conducted out of a renovated cottage, which is a big part of its charm.\nAfternoon tea here can come in several forms. There's the Royal Tea, which starts with a fine glass of Veuve Clicquot followed by the usual tea accouterments, plus a mixed green salad and fresh fruit. The Victorian Tea launches with a mimosa or sparkling cider and adds a specialty soup to the mix. Finally, there's a more locally-inspired, alcohol-free Mission Tea.\n\n(949) 443-3914\n31731 Los Rios St, San Juan Capistrano, CA 92675\nAfternoon tea is typically a long and relaxed affair that lasts for well over an hour. For an experience like that, opt for the Classic prefix menu at Brooklyn High Low, which includes high-quality finger sandwiches, scones, and pastries, along with bottomless pots of tea.\nBut if you're in a hurry but still want your warm beverage, this place has you covered with the quick and easy Cream Tea, served on Fridays between 2 and 5 p.m. This service lasts no longer than 45 minutes, which still leaves you with plenty of time to enjoy a pot of tea, vegetarian sandwiches, and scones.\n\n(646) 907-9467\n611 Vanderbilt Ave, Brooklyn, NY 11238\nAfternoon tea is served on the terrace of The Maybourne Beverly Hills on weekends between 2 and 4 p.m. The experience is fairly traditional, complete Laurent-Perrier Champagne and all the usual trappings, and centered in a sophisticated atmosphere. But it also stands out because of its use of local ingredients, like jam from Los Angeles-based Sqirl.\nIt should come as no surprise that The Maybourne serves a very fine afternoon tea. After all, its sister hotel, the Claridges in London, is one of the most iconic places in the wo",

        "summary": "\"Hearst Magazines and Yahoo may earn commission or revenue on some items through these links.\"\nKacey Musgraves' Saturn has returned, and so has her incredible music. The country crooner is set to release her sixth studio album, Deeper Well, on March 15\u2014and she's heading on the road, too. Spacey Kacey is bringing her admirably raw songwriting chops to the stage on her Deeper Well World Tour, where she's set to play her U.S. leg of shows in arenas from Brooklyn to Nashville. She'll be joined by the likes of Lord Huron, Father John Misty, Nickel Creek, and Madi Diaz.\n\n\nWith Kacey's angelic vocals, stunning visuals, and lyrics that pull at your heartstrings, it's a show you won't want to miss. Whether you giddy up to the sounds of Golden Hour, are still reeling in all the feels from \"Camera Roll,\" or kicking it back to \"Dime Store Cowgirl,\" here's how you can successfully snag tickets to Kacey Musgraves' Deeper Well World Tour.\nSept. 4 - State College, PA @ Bryce Jordan Center\nSept. 6 - Boston, MA @ TD Garden\nSept. 7 - Boston, MA @ TD Garden\nSept. 9 - Newark, NJ @ Prudential Center\nSept. 11 - Greenwood Village, CO @ Fiddler's Green Amphitheatre\nSept. 12 - Rosemont, IL @ Allstate Arena\nSept. 19 - Vancouver, BC @ Rogers Arena\nSept. 20 - Seattle, WA @ Climate Pledge Arena\nSept. 23 - Sacramento, CA @ Golden 1 Center\nSept. 24 - San Francisco, CA @ Chase Center\nSept. 27 - Glendale, AZ @ Desert Diamond Arena\nSept. 28 - Las Vegas, NV @ T-Mobile Arena\nOct. 1 - San Diego, CA @ Pechanga Arena\nOct. 3 - Inglewood, CA @ Kia Forum\nOct. 4 - Inglewood, CA @ Kia Forum\nNov. 6 - Montreal, QC @ Place Bell\nNov. 7 - Toronto, ON @ Scotiabank Arena\nNov. 9 - Baltimore, MD @ CFG Bank Arena\nNov. 10 - Pittsburgh, PA @ PPG Paints Arena\nNov. 13 - Columbus, OH @ Schottenstein Center\nNov. 15 - Brooklyn, NY @ Barclays Center\nNov. 16 - Brooklyn, NY @ Barclays Center\nNov. 21 - Houston, TX @ Toyota Center\nNov. 22 - Dallas, TX @ American Airlines Center\nNov. 23 - Dallas, TX @ American Airlines Center\nNov. 26 - Austin, TX @ Moody Center\nNov. 27 - Austin, TX @ Moody Center\nNov. 29 - Tampa, FL @ Amalie Arena\nNov. 30 - Hollywood, FL @ Seminole Hard Rock Live\nDec. 2 - Orlando, FL @ Amway Center\nDec. 5 - Charlotte, NC @ Spectrum Center\nDec. 6 - Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone Arena\nDec. 7 - Nashville, TN @ Bridgestone Arena\nTrust me\u201a Kacey would want you to kick those bots off their high horse so you can snag a seat to her transformative show. Make sure to sign in to your TicketMaster account, add Kacey as one of your favorite artists, and set reminders for any dates you're interested in attending. You'll be notified of any Kacey-related tour news through the TicketMaster app (you're so welcome for that!).\nFabulous q! Tickets for Kacey's upcoming tour will be sold on Ticketmaster. According to the site, an artist presale and a presale for American Express cardmembers will begin on March 5 at 10:00 a.m. local time. A Spotify presale will also take place on March 6 at 10:00 a.m. local time, followed by a local venues presale on March 7 at 10:00 a.m. local time. So, you've got plenty of chances to score seats!\nYou haven't been a Kacey stan for years for nothin'. Lucky for you, I've bought my way into tons of concerts (including Kacey's coveted spot as Harry Styles'opening act in 2018), so I've got you covered with the best practices!\n\nKacey Musgraves Tickets\nticketmaster.com\nFirst things first, you want to make sure all your info is up to date on your TicketMaster account ahead of the presale. Meaning: you should add your preferred card and contact info so you're not stressing the day of. It's also not a bad idea to take a look at your venue's seating chart to check out which seats you want so all you have to do later is click \"add to cart.\"\nIf you mean business when it comes to Kacey's tours, might I suggest setting an alarm 30 minutes before your pre-sale begins? It's honestly a fool-proof tip\u2014especially after the jump scare of the Eras Tour queue in 2022... IYKYK. \ud83e\udd72 The earlier you log on, the less time you'll spend in TicketMaster's queue.\nI know how tempting it is to invite everyone in your KM support group to the show, but it's best to aim for three tickets max when you're shopping. The more tickets you try buying, the harder it'll be to secure your spot. If you did want to pull up with a larger group, you might want to divide and conquer.\nIf you missed out on TicketMaster's presale or your show's date is sold out, don't stress! Other retailers like SeatGeek and StubHub include verified resale tickets for decent prices (so, run, don't walk over there).\n\n\n\nHere's What NOT to Wear to a Wedding\nMeet the Laziest, Easiest Acne Routine You'll Ever Try",

The North American tour will have her topping a triple bill, with Father John Misty opening the entire way, and Nickel Creek and Lord Huron trading places in the third spot.\nThe three-month U.S. leg starts just after Labor Day with a Sept. 4 show in State College, Penn., wrapping up with a two-night hometown stand at Nashville's Bridgestone Arena Dec. 6-7.\n\n\n\n\nNotable stops along the way include two nights at L.A.'s Kia Forum (Oct. 3-4), a pair of evenings at Brooklyn's Barclays Center (NOv. 15-16), additional two-nighters in Boston (Sept. 6-7), Dallas (Nov. 22-23) and Austin (NOv. 26-27), and single nights in locales from Seattle to Orlando.\nFather John Misty and Nickel Creek will open all the U.S. shows from the September kickoff through the L.A. Forum shows in early October. Thereafter, as the tour hits the Northeast and South through its early December Nashville finale, it'll be Father John Misty and Lord Huron in the opening slots.\nMeanwhile, it's Madi Diaz slated to open the shorter run of nine European dates. Those two weeks' worth of shows begin April 28 in Dublin and wrap up May 14 with a gig at London's roundhouse. (See the full list of dates, below.)\nTickets for the AEG Presents-promoted tour go on sale next week. An American Express cardholder presale starts March 5 at 10 a.m. local time. The general on-sale time is March 8 at 10 a.m. local time. Resale tickets are also available on Stubhub, VividSeats, Seatgeek and Ticketmaster.\nAdditionally, Musgraves released a second preview track from her 'Deeper Well' album Thursday, titled 'Too Good to Be True.' The full album comes out March 15.\nMusgraves is set to appear on 'Saturday Night Live' March 2.

(WFLA) \u2014 A new Zillow report is revealing just how much Tampa residents need to earn to afford a home.\nAccording to Zillow, a $58,577 income was enough to comfortably own a Tampa home in 2020. However, Zillow said 2024 buyers will need nearly 50% more income to afford a home in Tampa.\nToday, an income of $116,329 is enough to own a Tampa home, Zillow said.\nThis is the \u2018most affordable' ZIP code to buy property in Florida, study says\nThe report also showed that it will take Tampa homebuyers 9.8 years to save a 10% down payment for a home if they are making the median income.\nZillow said the average monthly mortgage payment in Tampa was $2,364, assuming the buyer puts down a 10% downpayment.\n'Housing costs have soared over the past four years as drastic hikes in home prices, mortgage rates and rent growth far outpaced wage gains,' said Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. 'Buyers are getting creative to make a purchase pencil out, and\u00a0long-distance movers\u00a0are targeting less expensive and less competitive metros. Mortgage rates easing down has helped some, but the key to improving affordability long term is to build more homes.'\nAccording to Zillow's research, the income needed to own a Tampa home was similar to that needed in Atlanta, Georgia; Baltimore, Maryland; and Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nMetropolitanArea*\nSizeRank\nIncome Neededto Afford aMortgage,January 2024\nChange inNeededIncome SinceJanuary 2020\nZillow HomeValue Index(ZHVI),January20243\nMonthlyMortgagePayment,10% Down4\nYears toSave a10%DownPayment\nPittsburgh, PA\n27\n$58,232\n$23,675\n$201,487\n$1,286\n5.3\nMemphis, TN\n43\n$69,976\n$31,717\n$230,807\n$1,473\n6.9\nCleveland, OH\n34\n$70,810\n$30,227\n$211,712\n$1,351\n6.0\nNew Orleans, LA\n46\n$74,048\n$19,203\n$232,870\n$1,486\n7.0\nBirmingham, AL\n50\n$74,338\n$31,875\n$246,805\n$1,575\n6.7\nOklahoma City, OK\n41\n$74,732\n$31,057\n$226,048\n$1,442\n6.3\nDetroit, MI\n14\n$75,662\n$31,124\n$236,025\n$1,506\n6.1\nBuffalo, NY\n49\n$76,884\n$34,744\n$242,435\n$1,547\n6.5\nSt. Louis, MO\n21\n$76,895\n$31,880\n$238,231\n$1,520\n5.9\nLouisville, KY\n45\n$77,450\n$31,185\n$243,810\n$1,556\n6.8\nIndianapolis, IN\n33\n$82,037\n$38,150\n$267,301\n$1,706\n6.6\nCincinnati, OH\n28\n$86,027\n$38,050\n$267,423\n$1,706\n6.8\nKansas City, MO\n31\n$92,896\n$40,742\n$289,290\n$1,846\n7.2\nHouston, TX\n5\n$95,374\n$39,779\n$300,955\n$1,920\n7.5\nSan Antonio, TX\n24\n$95,767\n$38,307\n$283,161\n$1,807\n7.5\nColumbus, OH\n32\n$95,821\n$43,405\n$297,637\n$1,899\n7.3\nMilwaukee, WI\n40\n$100,822\n$42,613\n$321,037\n$2,049\n8.5\nVirginia Beach, VA\n37\n$102,703\n$43,989\n$332,820\n$2,124\n8.2\nChicago, IL\n3\n$104,757\n$39,716\n$300,906\n$1,920\n6.7\nRichmond, VA\n44\n$106,170\n$47,930\n$349,558\n$2,231\n7.9\nUnited States\n0\n$106,536\n$47,490\n$342,941\n$2,188\n8.4\nPhiladelphia, PA\n7\n$109,257\n$47,837\n$343,102\n$2,189\n7.5\nJacksonville, FL\n39\n$109,271\n$51,617\n$348,665\n$2,225\n8.2\nCharlotte, NC\n23\n$111,051\n$55,239\n$368,712\n$2,353\n9.2\nHartford, CT\n48\n$114,109\n$52,114\n$334,712\n$2,136\n7.3\nMinneapolis, MN\n16\n$114,344\n$41,867\n$355,511\n$2,269\n7.3\nBaltimore, MD\n20\n$114,348\n$44,063\n$367,861\n$2,347\n7.6\nAtlanta, GA\n9\n$115,430\n$55,989\n$370,548\n$2,364\n8.0\nTampa, FL\n18\n$116,329\n$58,577\n$370,474\n$2,364\n9.8\nLas Vegas, NV\n30\n$119,529\n$54,172\n$407,516\n$2,600\n10.6\nDallas, TX\n4\n$121,398\n$53,679\n$366,690\n$2,340\n8.3\nOrlando, FL\n22\n$121,418\n$58,140\n$386,687\n$2,467\n9.9\nNashville, TN\n36\n$128,535\n$59,508\n$425,827\n$2,717\n10.1\nRaleigh, NC\n42\n$130,472\n$62,410\n$430,562\n$2,747\n8.7\nPhoenix, AZ\n11\n$131,322\n$65,017\n$447,074\n$2,853\n9.9\nProvidence, RI\n38\n$142,928\n$65,387\n$449,025\n$2,865\n10.1\nAustin, TX\n29\n$149,267\n$65,144\n$451,322\n$2,880\n8.8\nMiami, FL\n8\n$151,163\n$74,834\n$472,970\n$3,018\n12.3\nSalt Lake City, UT\n47\n$154,455\n$72,592\n$523,832\n$3,343\n10.6\nPortland, OR\n25\n$161,624\n$65,664\n$528,724\n$3,374\n11.0\nWashington, DC\n6\n$166,551\n$64,078\n$539,116\n$3,440\n8.2\nSacramento, CA\n26\n$172,261\n$69,908\n$559,243\n$3,569\n11.6\nDenver, CO\n19\n$172,704\n$71,338\n$566,692\n$3,616\n10.7\nRiverside, CA\n13\n$173,375\n$81,676\n$563,468\n$3,595\n12.6\nBoston, MA\n10\n$205,253\n$86,967\n$650,890\n$4,153\n11.6\nNew York, NY\n1\n$213,615\n$78,696\n$627,944\n$4,007\n12.9\nSeattle, WA\n15\n$213,984\n$94,163\n$697,824\n$4,453\n12.2\nSan Diego, CA\n17\n$273,613\n$131,018\n$902,199\n$5,757\n16.9\nLos Angeles, CA\n2\n$279,250\n$121,457\n$918,247\n$5,859\n19.4\nSan Francisco, CA\n12\n$339,864\n$119,614\n$1,104,853\n$7,050\n16.0\nSan Jose, CA\n35\n$454,296\n$191,071\n$1,493,255\n$9,528\n18.8\n*Table ordered by income needed to afford a mortgage in\u00a0January 2024.",

With this acquisition, JMB now owns both gold.com and silver.com, two of the most recognizable domains in the precious metals industry.\n'The acquisition of the gold.com domain represents a significant investment in our direct-to-consumer growth strategy,' said JMB CEO Robert Pacelli. 'The gold.com domain carries broad global appeal and is an extremely versatile asset that will be incorporated into our long term strategy. Prominent, single word domains are in high demand due to their scarcity, and benefits of such domains include instant brand recognition and enhanced marketability.'\nPacelli continued, 'It's rare to have an opportunity to acquire a category defining asset such as this, and we are excited to add the domain to our expanding portfolio. All gold.com traffic is currently being redirected to the JMB website, providing visitors with seamless access to the company's extensive range of products and services.'\nTransaction Advisors Tracy A. Gallegos of Duane Morris LLP acted as legal advisor to JMB. Andrew Miller of ATM Holdings, Inc., in conjunction with Hilco Digital Assets, LLC, acted as financial advisor to the seller of the gold.com domain.\nAbout A-Mark Precious MetalsFounded in 1965, A-Mark Precious Metals, Inc. is a leading fully integrated precious metals platform that offers an array of gold, silver, platinum, palladium, and copper bullion, numismatic coins, and related products to wholesale and retail customers via a portfolio of channels.

        "summary": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the Billionaires Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins Love These 14 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Billionaires Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins Love These 5 Stocks.\nWe have discussed at length the investment philosophies and stock picks of billionaire Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins in our previous articles. While a lot is common among these legendary investors, one of the biggest shared factors between the two is their adherence to fundamental value investing philosophy. And while the AI-fueled rally is causing growth stocks to remain in focus and value stocks to languish on the backburner, something interesting is happening that could be a sign of wider rotation of the financial markets towards value.\nBloomberg recently reported that BlackRock, the world's biggest asset manager, funneled billions into its value- and factor-based model portfolios as the firm bets on cheap and undervalued stocks for 2024. The Bloomberg report cited Michael Gates, lead portfolio manager for BlackRock's Target Allocation ETF model portfolio suite, who said in a latest report that BlackRock was \"switching the growth style over the value\" to reflect its bullish view on the economy as it expects a soft landing.\n'We remain optimistic and overweight stocks. This means we keep our heavy US tilt in portfolios, but consolidate some bets as we expect choppy markets over the first half of the year.'\nMethodology\nIn this environment it would be interesting to see which stocks were common in Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins' portfolios heading into 2024. For this article we scanned the Q4 portfolios of Gamco Investors \u2014 the hedge fund of billionaire Mario Gabelli \u2014 and the Q4 portfolio of Southeastern Asset Management \u2014 the fund led by Mason Hawkins \u2014 and picked 14 stocks in which both these funds had stakes as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. Hedge funds' top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 6\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $2,487,667\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $56,226,430\nArkansas-based roasted coffee company Westrock Coffee Co (NASDAQ:WEST) is one of the top stocks found in the portfolios of both Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins.\nIn November, Westrock Coffee Co (NASDAQ:WEST)\u00a0said its adjusted EBITDA outlook for 2023 was expected to fall below its previously issued guidance range of flat to 10% over 2022.\nLongleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund made the following comment about Westrock Coffee Company (NASDAQ:WEST) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n'Westrock Coffee Company (NASDAQ:WEST) \u2013 Westrock Coffee, which is the 'brand behind the brand' producing and distributing coffee, tea and extracts for larger entities, was another top detractor in the quarter. Westrock faced a challenging summer with inflation, heat waves making hot coffee less popular and high gas prices negatively impacting traffic at convenience stores and rest stops. However, our long-term case for the business is less dependent on the single serve coffee business and more predicated on the potentially transformative plant that will be operating in 2024 and will support a shift to higher value beverages that represent a tremendous growth opportunity. In the near-term, Westrock did a capital raise to accelerate the growth of the new plant, and this also weighed on the stock price in the short term.'\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $12,475,370\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $60,814,554\nGraham Holdings Co (NYSE:GHC)\u00a0is a conglomerate having multiple business segments including educational services, hospice care, car dealerships and media. Mario Gabelli's hedge fund had a $12.5 million stake in Graham Holdings Co (NYSE:GHC)\u00a0as of the end of the fourth quarter, while Mason Hawkins' Southeastern had a $60 million stake in Graham Holdings Co (NYSE:GHC).\nOver the past one year the stock has gained about 9% A total of 17 hedge funds out of the 933 fund in Insider Monkey had stakes in Graham Holdings Co (NYSE:GHC).\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 23\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $4,023,700\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $166,764,660\nNatural gas company CNX Resources Corp (NYSE:CNX)\u00a0is the biggest holding of Mason Hawkins' Southeastern as of the end of the fourth quarter, while Gabelli's hedge fund had a $4 million stake in CNX Resources Corp (NYSE:CNX).\nLongleaf Partners Small-Cap Fund made the following comment about CNX Resources Corporation (NYSE:CNX) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n'CNX Resources Corporation\u00a0(NYSE:CNX) \u2013 Natural gas company CNX Resources was the top performer in the quarter. The company benefited from rising energy prices, as well as strong operational execution. CNX remains highly discounted, as the market does not give the company credit for its longer-term undrilled assets or its 'new technology investments,' which include methods to reduce carbon on a net basis. Management expects this to be a material business for CNX over the longer term, but for now it is a high-quality hidden asset. CNX has taken advantage of the price disconnect through meaningful share repurchase.'\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 29\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $103,629,206\nMason Hawkins' Stake:\u00a0$51,034,139\nAgricultural and construction equipment company CNH Industrial NV (NYSE:CNHI) is one of the stocks loved by both Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins. The fourth quarter portfolio of Mario Gabelli's fund shows that it had a $103 million stake in CNH Industrial NV (NYSE:CNHI). On the other hand, Mason Hawkins' hedge fund had a $51 million stake in CNH Industrial NV (NYSE:CNHI).\nCNH Industrial NV (NYSE:CNHI)\u00a0stock is up about 1.8% over the past 30 days as of February 22.\nOakmark Global Select Fund made the following comment about CNH Industrial N.V. (NYSE:CNHI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n'CNH Industrial N.V.\u00a0(NYSE:CNHI) (Italy), which designs, manufactures, and distributes agricultural and construction equipment, was the top detractor for the quarter. CNH Industrial's share price fell following its second-quarter results, as agriculture equipment sales rose 5% in local currency, a slowdown from the prior quarter. This performance fell below market expectations due to destocking activity in Brazil and some production ramp-up issues for its new Patriot sprayer. We believe the production issues are temporary while the destocking actions will better position the business for the midterm. Pricing power remains quite strong and increased by roughly 7%, and precision agricultural sales grew by 21%. While the market was overly focused on near-term demand and sales growth, the agriculture equipment division produced its highest quarterly margin ever at 16.8%\u2014an encouraging development that supports our view of the company's long-term profitability. Further, the much smaller construction business delivered strong results, including its own quarterly margin record. Management maintained guidance for the rest of the company's current fiscal year and indicated it expects to exceed the 2024 targets laid out at a capital markets day in 2022. We recently met with CEO Scott Wine at the company's offices. He expressed confidence in the company's ability to drive much better through-cycle financial performance while avoiding the company's previous mistakes. He also believes the company's share price is materially undervalued, and although he would prefer to invest in the business, he sees an opportunity to increase returns to shareholders via share repurchases. We believe CNH Industrial remains a solid business in an attractive industry that is run by a much-improved management team.'\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 32\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $806,176\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $166,906,960\nMattel Inc (NASDAQ:MAT) stock jumped earlier this month after Mattel Inc (NASDAQ:MAT) gave a strong guidance for this year. Mattel Inc (NASDAQ:MAT) said its adjusted gross margin is expected to come between 48.5% and 49% compared to the average analyst estimate of 47.9%. Adjusted EBITDA is expected in the range of $975 million to $1.03 billion compared to the estimate $987.3 million. Mattel Inc (NASDAQ:MAT) sees adjusted EPS in the range of $1.35 to $1.45 compared to the expectation of $1.37.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $7,415,511\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $123,642,393\nKellogg Co (NYSE:K), which renamed itself last year to Kellanova Co (NYSE:K)\u00a0following a split, is one of the favorite stocks of Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins.\nEarlier this month, BofA published its list of \"Magnificent 80\" stocks that it believes can offer more in dividend yields than cash. Kellogg Co Co (NYSE:K) made it to the list. The stock has a dividend yield of 3.97% as of February 22.\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $1,157,703\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $118,390,585\nMedia and internet brands company IAC Inc (NASDAQ:IAC)\u00a0is loved by both Mario Gabelli ($1.1 million stake) and Mason Hawkins ($118 million stake).\nEarlier this month IAC Inc (NASDAQ:IAC)\u00a0posted fourth quarter results. EPS in the fourth quarter came in at $3.70. Revenue fell 15.2% year over year to $1.06 billion, missing estimates by $10 million.\nTimesSquare Capital U.S. Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about IAC Inc. (NASDAQ:IAC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n'For the Communications Services sector, we generally prefer to invest in media and services companies that are either well placed from an advertising perspective with a target audience or provide differentiated services.\u00a0IAC Inc.\u00a0(NASDAQ:IAC) is engaged in the media and Internet business. Its two core business segments are Dotdash Meredith and ANGI Homeservices. Dotdash Meredith provides digital and print publishing services. ANGI Homeservices offers a gateway to repair, remodeling, cleaning, and other services. While Dotdash Meredith results were in line, ANGI fell short of expectations as they are shifting their focus to high-quality customers to generate more profitability. Shares of IAC fell -20% on this report and we added to the position on weakness.'\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $23,854,520\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $111,144,762\nResorts and casino giant MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) is one of the stocks loved by both Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) recently reported fourth quarter results. MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) earned $1.06 per share, beating the Wall Street estimates of $0.35. Revenue jumped 22% on a year-over-year basis to $4.38 billion, surpassing estimates by $240 million.\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that 45 hedge funds had stakes in MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM)\u00a0as of the end of the last quarter of 2023.\nLongleaf Partners Fund stated the following regarding MGM Resorts International (NYSE:MGM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n'MGM Resorts International\u00a0(NYSE:MGM) & Hyatt \u2013 Hospitality companies MGM Resorts and Hyatt were both strong performers in the fourth quarter and for the year, outperforming expectations that the post-COVID travel rebound would ease in 2023. Casino and online gaming company MGM saw double-digit revenue growth and strong 2023 bookings in Las Vegas in the first half, which moderated in the second half but remained solid. A cybersecurity attack negatively impacted 3Q results, but MGM does not expect the $100 million hit to have a material effect on its financial condition and operational results for the year. MGM bought back discounted shares at a 15% annualized rate and authorized another $2 billion buyback in 4Q, which represents another 15% of the company.'\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 45\nMario Gabelli's Stake: $24,476,447\nMason Hawkins' Stake: $115,526,362\nLast month, Roth MKM upgraded Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)\u00a0shares to Buy from Neutral and raised the stock's price target to $114 from $92. Roth MKM cited an increased demand for live events and concerns in the US for its bullish outlook on the stock.\nOut of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 45 hedge funds had stakes in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV). The biggest hedge fund stakeholder of\u00a0Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV)\u00a0during this period was Robert Joseph Caruso's Select Equity Group which owns a $979 million stake in Live Nation Entertainment Inc (NYSE:LYV).\nLongleaf Partners Fund stated the following regarding Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. (NYSE:LYV) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n'Live Nation Entertainment, Inc.\u00a0(NYSE:LYV) \u2013 Live Nation Entertainment, a new purchase this year, was a strong performer in the fourth quarter and a strong performer for the year as it outperformed expectations. Live Nation reported a great 3Q, with revenues and adjusted operating income up 30%+, concert revenues up 29% and ticketing up 55%. The company guided for continued strong growth in 2024. We have prior knowledge of Live Nation from our time owning various Liberty Media entities and are encouraged on future capital allocation that Liberty is still on the case as a 30%+ owner.'\n\nClick to continue reading and see Billionaires Mario Gabelli and Mason Hawkins Love 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n\n\nDisclosure.\u00a0None.\u00a0Mario Gabelli Mason Hawkins Love These 14 Stocks\u00a0was initially published on Insider Monkey.",

The tour will conclude in her hometown of Nashville on Dec. 7.\nArtists joining Musgraves, 35, throughout the string of concerts include Madi Diaz, Father John Misty, Lord Huron and Nickel Creek.\nThe \"Follow Your Arrow\" singer announced the news on Instagram alongside a tour poster, writing in the caption, \"Tap into your\u00a0\ud835\udcd3\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcf9\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcfb \ud835\udce6\ud835\udcee\ud835\udcf5\ud835\udcf5 with me on tour.\"\n\nAmerican Express card members can purchase tickets for the Deeper Well World tour in select markets before the general market.

Tickets will then go on sale to the general public on March 8 at 10 a.m. local time at https://www.kaceymusgraves.com/tour.\nIn addition to the tour announcement, Musgraves also unveiled a new track from her upcoming album called \"Too Good to be True.\"\nIn the track, Musgraves sings about falling in love \u2014 and the fear of having your heart broken.\nKelly Christine Sutton\n\"Please don't make me regret/Openin' up that part of myself/That I've been scared to give again,\" she sings. \"Be good to me and I'll be good to you/But please don't be too good to be true.\"\n\"Too Good to be True\" is the second track released from Deeper Well, which is set for release on March 15.\nIn conversation with Zane Lowe\u00a0on Apple Music 1 earlier this month, the singer-songwriter opened up about getting vulnerable for her upcoming album.\n\nDolly Faibyshev/WWD via Getty Images\n'I really do believe in the biggest, most powerful form of connection is vulnerability,' began the Grammy winner. 'So it's like on one hand, I think there's hardly ever any mystery left in life, especially with artists. But at the same time, we're here to connect.'\nShe explained that artists and audiences 'all experience the same emotions.' Musgraves revealed that she wants to 'f---ing put it out there' and not 'hold back.' However, she revealed to Lowe, that being vulnerable 'can be scary' because she is 'kind of a private person.'\n'I really enjoy and revere my privacy and having something just for me and my personal life. I'm really kind of a homebody,' confessed the singer.\n'And as you get ready to release a project, this tsunami of madness is coming to work me. And you're going to be very public-facing again,' she revealed. 'And that can be \u2014 that's kind of hard for me sometimes.'\nSee Musgraves' complete list of Deeper Well World Tour dates below.\nApril 28, 2024 - Dublin, IE - 3Olympia Theatre +\nMay 1, 2024 - Amsterdam, NL - Paradiso +\nMay 3, 2024 - Brussels, BE - Ancienne Belgique +\nMay 5, 2024 - Cologne, DE - Carlswerk Victoria +\nMay 6, 2024 - Hamburg, DE - DOCKS +\nMay 9, 2024 - Glasgow, UK - 02 Academy Glasgow +\nMay 11, 2024 - Manchester, UK - 02 Apollo Manchester +\nMay 13, 2024 - Wolverhampton, UK - The Civic at The Halls +\nMay 14, 2024 - London, UK - Roundhouse +\nSept. 4, 2024 - State College, PA - Bryce Jordan Center *\nSept. 6, 2024 - Boston, MA - TD Garden *\nSept. 7, 2024 - Boston, MA - TD Garden *\nSept. 9, 2024 - Newark, NJ - Prudential Center *\nSept. 11, 2024 - Grand Rapids, MI - Van Andel Arena *\nSept. 12, 2024 - Rosemont, IL - Allstate Arena *\nSept. 15, 2024 - Greenwood Village, CO - Fiddler's Green Amphitheatre *\nSept. 19, 2024 - Vancouver, BC - Rogers Arena *\nSept. 20, 2024 - Seattle, WA - Climate Pledge Arena *\nSept. 23, 2024 - Sacramento, CA - Golden 1 Center *\nSept. 24, 2024 - San Francisco, CA - Chase Center *\nSept. 27, 2024 - Glendale, AZ - Desert Diamond Arena *\nSept. 28, 2024 - Las Vegas, NV - T-Mobile Arena *\nOct. 1, 2024 - San Diego, CA - Pechanga Arena San Diego *\nOct. 3, 2024 - Inglewood, CA - Kia Forum *\nOct. 4, 2024 - Inglewood, CA - Kia Forum *\nNov. 6, 2024 - Laval, QC - Place Bell #\nNov. 7, 2024 - Toronto, ON - Scotiabank Arena #\nNov. 9, 2024 - Baltimore, MD - CFG Bank Arena #\nNov. 10, 2024 - Pittsburgh, PA - PPG Paints Arena #\nNov. 12, 2024 - Louisville, KY - KFC Yum!

        "summary": "Sierra Ferrell is bringing some goddess energy to the cover of her excellent new album, 'Trail of Flowers,' and that fits. Just two albums into her career, Ferrell is already on the fast track to queenliness, if not godhood, among roots enthusiasts. In a world where a neo-bluegrass guy like Billy Strings can suddenly become a star among the kids, Ferrell may be the closest thing we have to that among female stars. Given the chance, she'll be the one to unite the jam-band crowd, string-band people, singer-songwriter enthusiasts, Gram Parsons-loving country-rockers, hippies, hillbillies and anyone who just likes good, hooky songs.\nFerrell won't be tied down: 'I love to just play whatever brings me joy, and it's not necessarily one sort of genre.' The joy is contagious whenever Ferrell opens up her considerable pipes, which would be enough, even before she enlivens a set with her guitar picking and fiddle playing. Given her participation on Zach Bryan's bestselling album and spots on his tour, even more potential fans are finding out that Ferrell is the full package in the realm of acoustically based music. Variety spoke with her shortly before 'Trail of Flowers' came out and a new tour kicked off, starting with shows at L.A.'s Fonda Theatre April 3-4 (see the full itinerary below).\nMore from Variety\n'Morning Dew' for Your Morning Brew: This Grateful Dead Bear Mug Is Back in Stock\nThe War and Treaty: How the Best New Artist Grammy Nominees Came to Be 'Friends' With the Emmys, Too, and Win Over Superfan Zach Bryan\nThe Ultimate Deadhead Gift Guide\nYour style sense is always intriguing. You can definitely rock the Nudie's-type suit, like when we saw you recently saluting Gram Parsons at the Grammy Museum. But we never know exactly what your image is going to be the next time we see you.\nA fun part for me is the visual \u2014 the outfits, the different clothes. It makes me happy, and if I feel happy, I can put on a better show for people, and if I put on a better show for people, maybe they'll come back.\nIf there is a predictable element at all to your look, it's that flowers seem to be involved, a fair amount, in your costuming and hair.\nI love flowers, and that's why my record's called 'Trail of Flowers.' Because wherever I go to play, I end up leaving tons of trails of flowers everywhere. And that's how that title even came to be.\nSo you don't mind shedding, a little bit.\nI don't mind shedding a little bit and, in fact, honestly, it's good to shed, it turns out.\nIt looks like you have a gold tooth. Is that something new for you?\nOh yeah, I just got it on. If I was gonna have to put a fake tooth in there, I might as well make it gold, you know? And there's a little heart on there \u2014 for 'Eat your heart out.'\nIn terms of how you arrived at your sound, it's just always intriguing when someone like you comes along who has a kind of purity to her sound. You've said you grew up listening to normal stuff that was on the radio, and not any of the old-time influences we can hear in your music. It wasn't like you had a mom or a grandma who just played 78s all day long.\nYeah \u2014 I wish. I kind of grew up just listening to \u201890s music. I didn't really know much about anything, really. And I feel like I started to learn more about old-time music in my early twenties, when I started going to more festivals.\nThe Grateful Dead is like a gateway drug for a lot of young people now to get into bluegrass and that kind of thing. You were part of a band early on that played Dead covers. Was that part of how it worked for you, or did you had some other kind of entry into some of the older or more acoustic sounds that you incorporate?\nWell, honestly, when I joined that band, I didn't even know who the Grateful Dead was. The band would joke and say, 'Oh, these are songs that we've written,' and they would just snicker and laugh about it with each other. Of course, eventually I found out it was a cover band, and I was OK with it, because they're great songs and it was fun \u2014 and in more of a dance mode, a lot, and so it was fun to dance around and play tambourine on stage. But then that just wasn't enough for me. I wanted to start playing instruments, and I had more songs that I was writing, and they wanted to do the songs they wanted to do, which involved a lot of Grateful Dead covers. That band, 600lbs of Sin, served its purpose, and I'm glad that I got to experience it and be in it, but I knew that there was more for me.\nI knew that there was something else, and I didn't really find out as much about the bluegrass and the old-time community until maybe my early twenties. And I was touring around West Virginia and some neighboring states a bunch, and there was this band called Fox Hunt. They were a string band, and John R. Miller was one of the lead singers and the guitar player in that band. And I wrote that 'Fox Hunt' song [on the new album] in some sort of way to tip the hat to him and to thank him and his group for the inspiration to be where I am now, with my hands and feet dipped in old times.\nA lot of people in the roots community probably have a lot of hopes pinned on you, because you are the kind of representation of acoustic-based music that everyone just 'gets,' whether they've been exposed to it before or not. Do you get that sense that there's kind of a mixed audience for you, from people who are like, 'Yes, this exemplifies everything we love,' to maybe some people who are going, 'I have no idea what this kind of music is, but I like it'?\nYou know, it's funny, though, because some people will reach out and say, 'Oh, I love your music, but take your nose ring out.' It's like a lot of people with opinions, and opinions are like buttholes, and everyone's got one. There's that conservative group that sometimes I tend to pick up because of that old sound that I have. And I am more relatable probably with their children than them, in a sense, where my style is flamboyant and I have piercings, I have a gold tooth, I have tattoos. Honestly, those things are so old, and those are the sort of things that have been around longer than most things. So that's also what's baffling at times \u2014 people do think that they're right and they think that that's what's how things should be, and in reality it's not. And some people need to fucking get their head out of their ass and fucking just either like it or don't, and if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. \u2026 I definitely keep people talking, and I'm OK with that. I'm OK with someone liking me and I'm OK with somebody not liking me.\nWhat was the appeal of the festivals that hooked you into this particular melange of music?\nIt's not something that you go and you're like, 'Hey! I'm playing this festival!' It's more like you go to be able to hear all the musicians, because everyone plays fiddle or guitar or mandolin or banjo and\u2026 I don't know. I just love those instruments. I love instruments that you don't have to plug in. And then if, like, we don't have electricity, do you want to hang out with the electric guitar player and the electric bass player, or the upright bass or the acoustic guitar player? So it's like, so much respect for that style of music, for that reason. For me as a person, when cords and electricity get involved, it gets a little harder.\nYou recently played the Grand Ole Opry for the first time. Was that cool for you?\nYeah, I love the Grand Ole Opry, and I hope to be a member one day. I'm gonna keep going back and playing. I love the old Nashville, like the 'Hee-Haw' era and those shows\u2026 I just love it. That's what made me fall in love with country music.\nYou're on Zach Bryan's self-titled album, on the song 'Holy Roller,' and you will be opening some huge shows for him.\nI feel like that's his 'friends' record, because there's so many of his homies and friends that are just there being a part of the record, and I think that's beautiful.\nHow did Bryan become enamored of what you do?\nWell, we were playing the same festivals and he would come and watch my show side stage. And then, after Railbird (in Lexington, Kentucky), he messaged me and said, ' I have this song; I would love for you to be on it.' And then he sent it to me and I got goosebumps all over my body and I knew that I had to be a part of it. Those are my pull-the-trigger moments, whenever I get body goosebumps from a song or from an artist; it means that I should be working with them. I love that song. I love how gentle I get to be on that song. I like to show my fans too as well that I am very intense, but I can also be very gentle.\nAt your record release party in L.A., you announced what your favorite song was off your neew album, and also your least favorite song Your favorite was 'I Could Drive You Crazy.'\nYes. I love it because it's coming from a place of admitting your strengths and your weaknesses. It's like, 'I can't do this \u2014 but I can drive you crazy.' I think that's something that a lot of people need to lean in more and realize our strengths and our weaknesses, so then we can find people around us with the strengths that we need.\nAnd then you said your least favorite was 'Wish You Well.' Is that maybe because that's probably the saddest song on the album?\nYeah, that's exactly the reason for that: I'm sort of towards the end of my sad era. Everybody loves a sad song, but that's just the condition that we are put in. It's not even 100% our fault. That's just how it is. Once you realize what's really going on behind the grand scheme of everything, like how in the U.S. the rich keep getting richer, and the people in charge keep getting more money, and then they use the tax money for things that we don't need or want\u2026 I just think that it's important to think about something to look forward to and something brighter, something more beautiful.\nYou did say in an interview that it was a breakup that got you started writing songs.\nIt was definitely a breakup that got me started writing songs. And I guess once you find a good vein, you don't really wanna tap another one because you're there; you found it. But I'm in a positivity sort of flip side. Like, instead of people saying 'That's sick!,' I want people to say, 'That's healthy!'\nYou have a song on the new album called 'Dollar Bill Bar.' Did you have any real bar in mind with that one?\nWell, it makes me think of honestly of one of those generic beach bars, where they've got the dollar bills hanging up everywhere. The first bar that actually comes to mind is in South Florida, Key West \u2014 there's this bar downtown that Ernest Hemingway used to hang out at a lot. I don't know 100% what that bar is, but if anyone knows where it is and they want to message me about it, I'd love that.\nThe one song you have on the album that you didn't write is\u2026\n'Chittlin' Cookin' Time in Cheatham County.' Say that three times fast. It's actually very old. It's a slave song from back in the day. That's something that I love to talk about because I don't think people need to forget, and society wants you to forget. It happened, and we can't let this happen again. And we don't have to go 'viva revolution!' right now, but that's kind of where I tend to float a lot, because I just think that we have such a brighter future, and the way that things are, it doesn't look like a bright future, and it's sad and it's depressing.\nSo you're conscious of bringing joy into people's lives.\nI know that my music does that and I love that so much. I am a healer, and I know that I'm here to help heal in some sort of way. If not just myself, then there's a lot of people around me, and I want to be a part of the solution. I mean, people just look at the (present) day, and they don't look at years down the road. We're so self-serving and stuck in our heads, we're like egomaniacs, and I don't know \u2014 I just think that we need a better infrastructure; we need better leaders. I want to be a part of a brighter future for our children.\nYour music hasn't been overtly political, but you're obviously concerned about the state of the world. You have a song called 'American Dreaming.' Would your vision of the American dream cause you to get politically involved in an election year?\nI think that they're left and right wings of the same bird. I think regional voting's very important, because it affects you immediately, and I think that you can actually vote people in. It's not like you're like, 'Oh, I guess I'll pick the lesser of the evils,' which is how it is every fucking presidential election. It is not like you get to actually pick someone and be like, 'OK I want you to run.' No, they always keep it in their family, in some sort of fucking weird bloodline shit\u2026\nI don't even know if I'll ever have kids, and that's OK, because I'm too terrified to have children right now. They're literally feeding us poison, constantly, consistently, in our food and our products, and in reliable places, too. Like where they used to have butter ingredients, now they're cutting corners, and they know what they're doing and they're poisoning us. There's some seasonings now that they find all these heavy metals in there, when you go get dishes from Target and Walmart. It's like, what are you doing? We're not led by humans. Humans care about people; they care about the planet.\nSierra Ferrell Tour Dates\n4/3 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 The Fonda Theatre &\n4/4 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 The Fonda Theatre &\n4/6 \u2013 Olympic Valley, CA \u2013 WinterWonderGrass Tahoe\n4/9-4/13 \u2013 Puerto Aventuras, QR \u2013 The Avett Brothers At The Beach\n4/17 \u2013 Kansas City, MO \u2013 The Truman #\n4/18 \u2013 Oklahoma City, OK \u2013 Tower Theatre #\n4/19 \u2013 Fayetteville, AR \u2013 JJ's Live #\n4/20-4/21 \u2013 Georgetown, TX \u2013 Two Step Inn\n4/23 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Thalia Hall #\n4/24 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Thalia Hall #\n4/26 \u2013 Minneapolis, MN \u2013 First Avenue #\n4/27 \u2013 Milwaukee, WI \u2013 The Pabst Theater #\n4/28 \u2013 St. Louis, MO \u2013 The Pageant #\n5/9 \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 The Eastern %\n5/10 \u2013 Charleston, SC \u2013 Charleston Music Hall %\n5/11 \u2013 Raleigh, NC \u2013 The Ritz %\n5/12 \u2013 Charlotte, NC \u2013 The Fillmore Charlotte %\n5/14 \u2013 Philadelphia, PA \u2013 Union Transfer %\n5/16 \u2013 New York, NY \u2013 Webster Hall %\n5/17 \u2013 Forest Hills, NY \u2013 Forest Hills Stadium^\n5/18 \u2013 Boston, MA \u2013 The Stage at Suffolk Downs^\n5/21 \u2013 New Haven, CT \u2013 Westville Music Bowl^\n5/22 \u2013 Washington, DC \u2013 9:30 Club %\n5/23 \u2013 Albany, NY \u2013 MVP Arena^\n5/24 \u2013 Canandaigua, NY \u2013 Constellation Brands-Marvin Sands Performing Arts^\n5/26 \u2013 Cumberland, MD \u2013 DelFest\n6/4 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 Crypto.com Arena*\n6/6-6/8 \u2013 Torrey, UT \u2013 Forest Desolation Fest\n6/7 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV \u2013 T-Mobile Arena*\n6/8 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV \u2013 T-Mobile Arena*\n6/14 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 Empower Field at Mile High*\n6/15 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 Empower Field at Mile High*\n6/20-6/23 \u2013 Telluride, CO \u2013 Telluride Bluegrass Festival\n6/27-6/29 \u2013 Eau Claire, WI \u2013 Blue Ox Festival\n7/12-7/14 \u2013 Whitefish, MT \u2013 Under The Big Sky Festival\n7/26 \u2013 Floyd, VA \u2013 Floydfest\n7/28 \u2013 Newport, RI \u2013 Newport Folk Fest\n8/10 \u2013 Vancouver, BC \u2013 Orpheum Theatre!\n8/11 \u2013 Seattle, WA \u2013 Woodland Park Zoo Amphitheatre!\n8/12 \u2013 Portland, OR \u2013 Pioneer Courthouse Square!\n8/14 \u2013 Boise, ID \u2013 Idaho Botanical Garden: Outlaw Field!\n8/16 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 The Mission Ballroom!\n8/18 \u2013 Santa Fe, NM \u2013 The Bridge at Santa Fe Brewing Co.\n8/24 \u2013 Memphis, TN \u2013 Overton Park Shell\n9/1 \u2013 Columbia, MD \u2013 Merriweather Post Pavilion with Mitski\n9/10 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 Massey Hall\n9/14 \u2013 Asbury Park, NJ \u2013 Sea.Hear.Now.

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS, NV - (NewMediaWire) - March 27, 2024 - In a recent development for the agricultural and hemp industries, Hemp, Inc. (OTC: HEMP) is thrilled to announce that hemp seed meal is on the cusp of receiving approval for use in animal feed, starting with laying hen diets. This significant advancement follows a tentative approval of a definition for hemp seed meal by a committee of the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) earlier this year, marking a pivotal step towards legal distribution as an approved feed ingredient in the United States.\nHemp, Inc. and its partners view this development as not just a victory for the hemp industry, but as a testament to the sustainable and innovative solutions that hemp products can offer to the agricultural sector at large.\nAccording to AAFCO's Executive Director, Austin Therrell, the hemp seed meal would require the nod from both the AAFCO board of directors and the general membership before it can be officially distributed. The final decision is anticipated at AAFCO's annual meeting in August, in San Antonio.\nHemp seed meal is recognized for its rich content of vitamins, minerals, oils, and proteins, offering substantial benefits to laying hens. It promises to serve a comparable role to soy or canola meal in layer diets, with the added advantage of enhancing the quality and amino acid profile of the eggs produced.\nNotably, hemp seeds are devoid of THC and CBD, components that have raised concerns in other hemp products due to potential contamination risks. The Hemp Feed Coalition has ensured that any presence of these substances in hemp seed will be classified as contaminants, aligning with regulatory standards.\nUpon approval of this initial application, the Hemp Feed Coalition plans to extend its efforts to secure approvals for the use of hemp seed in diets for additional animal species, starting with ruminants and eventually expanding to broilers. The Coalition anticipates a smoother and faster approval process for these subsequent applications, buoyed by the precedent set for laying hens.\nHemp, Inc. has been one of the key players in this burgeoning industry, driving the market forward with its quality products and strategic market approaches. Coupled with an invaluable roster of connections with hemp manufacturers and vendors across the country and abroad, the Company expects to see meteoric growth curves on a domestic and international scale as the industry continues to grow.\nThrough its e-portal (www.hempinc.com), the Company's hemp-derived products are poised to capture a large share of the marketplace on a global scale and to play a vital role in maintaining good health and well-being 2 significant growth factors of the CBD market. The Company's product line contains CBD, CBDA, CBG, CBGA, and CBN (non-psychoactive compounds found in cannabis plants). These are active ingredients in cannabis that are derived from the hemp plant, which is widely known for pain relief, relaxation, and anxiety relief. A recipe is only as good as its ingredients and how those ingredients are blended.\nHemp, Inc. is the only company in America that uses pharmaceutical-grade beta-cyclodextrin (a carbohydrate used during the manufacturing process). Carbohydrates bond with oils including all the cannabinoids for massive and rapid absorption and uptake. The Company's CBD, CBDA, CBG, CBGA, and CBN product lines are highly potent therapeutic doses that have received rave reviews.\nHemp, Inc. has also pushed the boundaries with its CBD/CBG coffee enhancer. This powerhouse product is super potent, absorbs rapidly in coffee, and is 4 times more potent (at a fraction of the price) than other hemp-derived coffee enhancers currently on the market. Its high-quality ingredient combination offers 30 servings per bottle and contains a total of 10,000mg of cannabinoids (7,500mg CBD and 2,500mg CBG) in an MCT oil base. Per serving, that's 250mg CBD and 83mg CBG remarkably mixed in a wonderfully rich cup of coffee.\nThe CBD/CBG coffee enhancer comes in plain (natural) and vanilla flavors. The plain (natural) coffee enhancer is available now and the vanilla flavor will be available by the end of this month. A single container (7-day supply) retails for $27.95 and a bottle (30-day supply) retails for $99.95. Wholesale bulk orders are single-use packages, available through select restaurants. Currently, Hemp, Inc. has decided to expand its product line and has updated its website. The Company will announce its new products as they are launched throughout the year.\nFor more information on Hemp, Inc.'s products, click here.\nHemp, Inc. also discovered its grounded kenaf and hemp blend is the perfect substrate to grow healthy and/or medicinal mushrooms and can make and/or provide the raw materials to produce hemp-based products such as hempcrete, horse bedding, hemp bio-plastics, and more. As one of the most rapidly growing plants on the planet, the hemp plant is used to make a variety of hemp products. It can be shifted into rope, paper, textiles, clothing, disposable polymers, paint, insulation, food, and animal feed.\nOn the industrial side, Hemp, Inc.'s industrial hemp plant in North Carolina manufactures and sells two industrial hemp products: Spill-Be-Gone(TM) (an oil spill cleanup product made from the core particles and powder of the kenaf and hemp plant) and DrillWall(TM) (a non-toxic, biodegradable drilling fluid additive used in oilfield drilling applications). Hemp, Inc.'s Spill-Be-Gone(TM) is sold in industrial-sized quantities for large oil spill cleanups. It is fast and cost-effective in cleaning up oil spills on land or water. The Company's DrillWall(TM) is a tested LCM made of kenaf and hemp cellulose. It includes milled products from kenaf and hemp that are made into oil drilling fluid additives and oil absorbents.\nHemp, Inc. will continue to keep its shareholders up to date on all pertinent material events, product releases, production plans, and inventory availability.

        "summary": "DENVER (KDVR) \u2014 With the\u00a0price of homes in Denver more than doubling\u00a0over the last decade, a $100,000 salary doesn't go as far as it used to.\nIn 2020, a $101,365 income was enough to comfortably own a home in Denver. But according to a recent report from Zillow, that number has since increased by 70.5%.\n\nToday, homebuyers need to make $173,000 to afford a home in Denver, according to the Zillow report.\nThe report found monthly mortgage payments on typical Denver metro area homes have 'risen sharply since January 2020.'\nAssuming a 10% down payment, Zillow reports that mortgage payments have increased 85.5% over the last four years to $3,615 monthly.\nA similar trend has been seen on a smaller scale across the U.S., with the average mortgage payment on a typical U.S. home nearly doubling since 2020.\nHomeowners across the U.S. need to make over $106,000 to comfortably own a home, according to Zillow. That is up 80% since January 2020, when a $59,000 household income was enough to comfortably own a home.\nIn January 2020, the U.S. median income was about $66,000, meaning more than half of American households could afford to buy a home. Now, a typical U.S. household earns an estimated $81,000 each year, well below the six-digit income necessary to own a home.\nMeanwhile, Zillow estimates that a household must make $173,000 to afford a home in Denver.\n\nThe income necessary to own a home in Denver was comparable to that of Washington, D.C.; Portland, Oregon; Sacramento, California; and Riverside, California.\nMetropolitan Area*\nSize Rank\nIncome Needed to Afford a Mortgage, January 2024\nChange in Needed Income Since January 2020\nZillow Home Value Index (ZHVI), January 2024\nMonthly Mortgage Payment, 10% Down\nYears to Save a 10% Down Payment\nPittsburgh, PA\n27\n$58,232\n$23,675\n$201,487\n$1,286\n5.3\nMemphis, TN\n43\n$69,976\n$31,717\n$230,807\n$1,473\n6.9\nCleveland, OH\n34\n$70,810\n$30,227\n$211,712\n$1,351\n6.0\nNew Orleans, LA\n46\n$74,048\n$19,203\n$232,870\n$1,486\n7.0\nBirmingham, AL\n50\n$74,338\n$31,875\n$246,805\n$1,575\n6.7\nOklahoma City, OK\n41\n$74,732\n$31,057\n$226,048\n$1,442\n6.3\nDetroit, MI\n14\n$75,662\n$31,124\n$236,025\n$1,506\n6.1\nBuffalo, NY\n49\n$76,884\n$34,744\n$242,435\n$1,547\n6.5\nSt. Louis, MO\n21\n$76,895\n$31,880\n$238,231\n$1,520\n5.9\nLouisville, KY\n45\n$77,450\n$31,185\n$243,810\n$1,556\n6.8\nIndianapolis, IN\n33\n$82,037\n$38,150\n$267,301\n$1,706\n6.6\nCincinnati, OH\n28\n$86,027\n$38,050\n$267,423\n$1,706\n6.8\nKansas City, MO\n31\n$92,896\n$40,742\n$289,290\n$1,846\n7.2\nHouston, TX\n5\n$95,374\n$39,779\n$300,955\n$1,920\n7.5\nSan Antonio, TX\n24\n$95,767\n$38,307\n$283,161\n$1,807\n7.5\nColumbus, OH\n32\n$95,821\n$43,405\n$297,637\n$1,899\n7.3\nMilwaukee, WI\n40\n$100,822\n$42,613\n$321,037\n$2,049\n8.5\nVirginia Beach, VA\n37\n$102,703\n$43,989\n$332,820\n$2,124\n8.2\nChicago, IL\n3\n$104,757\n$39,716\n$300,906\n$1,920\n6.7\nRichmond, VA\n44\n$106,170\n$47,930\n$349,558\n$2,231\n7.9\nUnited States\n0\n$106,536\n$47,490\n$342,941\n$2,188\n8.4\nPhiladelphia, PA\n7\n$109,257\n$47,837\n$343,102\n$2,189\n7.5\nJacksonville, FL\n39\n$109,271\n$51,617\n$348,665\n$2,225\n8.2\nCharlotte, NC\n23\n$111,051\n$55,239\n$368,712\n$2,353\n9.2\nHartford, CT\n48\n$114,109\n$52,114\n$334,712\n$2,136\n7.3\nMinneapolis, MN\n16\n$114,344\n$41,867\n$355,511\n$2,269\n7.3\nBaltimore, MD\n20\n$114,348\n$44,063\n$367,861\n$2,347\n7.6\nAtlanta, GA\n9\n$115,430\n$55,989\n$370,548\n$2,364\n8.0\nTampa, FL\n18\n$116,329\n$58,577\n$370,474\n$2,364\n9.8\nLas Vegas, NV\n30\n$119,529\n$54,172\n$407,516\n$2,600\n10.6\nDallas, TX\n4\n$121,398\n$53,679\n$366,690\n$2,340\n8.3\nOrlando, FL\n22\n$121,418\n$58,140\n$386,687\n$2,467\n9.9\nNashville, TN\n36\n$128,535\n$59,508\n$425,827\n$2,717\n10.1\nRaleigh, NC\n42\n$130,472\n$62,410\n$430,562\n$2,747\n8.7\nPhoenix, AZ\n11\n$131,322\n$65,017\n$447,074\n$2,853\n9.9\nProvidence, RI\n38\n$142,928\n$65,387\n$449,025\n$2,865\n10.1\nAustin, TX\n29\n$149,267\n$65,144\n$451,322\n$2,880\n8.8\nMiami, FL\n8\n$151,163\n$74,834\n$472,970\n$3,018\n12.3\nSalt Lake City, UT\n47\n$154,455\n$72,592\n$523,832\n$3,343\n10.6\nPortland, OR\n25\n$161,624\n$65,664\n$528,724\n$3,374\n11.0\nWashington, DC\n6\n$166,551\n$64,078\n$539,116\n$3,440\n8.2\nSacramento, CA\n26\n$172,261\n$69,908\n$559,243\n$3,569\n11.6\nDenver, CO\n19\n$172,704\n$71,338\n$566,692\n$3,616\n10.7\nRiverside, CA\n13\n$173,375\n$81,676\n$563,468\n$3,595\n12.6\nBoston, MA\n10\n$205,253\n$86,967\n$650,890\n$4,153\n11.6\nNew York, NY\n1\n$213,615\n$78,696\n$627,944\n$4,007\n12.9\nSeattle, WA\n15\n$213,984\n$94,163\n$697,824\n$4,453\n12.2\nSan Diego, CA\n17\n$273,613\n$131,018\n$902,199\n$5,757\n16.9\nLos Angeles, CA\n2\n$279,250\n$121,457\n$918,247\n$5,859\n19.4\nSan Francisco, CA\n12\n$339,864\n$119,614\n$1,104,853\n$7,050\n16.0\nSan Jose, CA\n35\n$454,296\n$191,071\n$1,493,255\n$9,528\n18.8\nNumerous reports have found that wages across the U.S. are not keeping up with housing costs.\n'Housing costs have soared over the past four years as drastic hikes in home prices, mortgage rates and rent growth far outpaced wage gains,' Zillow senior economist Orphe Divounguy said.\n\nAccording to a recent report from the Common Sense Institute of Colorado, a think tank focused on free enterprise, homeowners in the Denver metro area needed to work about 114 hours to pay a mortgage in 2023, up 172.3% from the 42 hours required to pay a mortgage in 2013.\nWhile the cost of owning a home in Denver has increased by 18% since 2022, the institute's report found that wages have only increased by 6%.",

        "excerpt": "ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property, and real estate data, today released its Q1 2024 Single-Family Rental Market report, which ranks the best U.S. markets for buying single-family rental\u2026",
        "summary": "Highest Potential SFR Returns around Vero Beach, St. Louis, Brownsville, Rochester and Augusta; Rental Margins Increasing in About Two-thirds of Nation\nIRVINE, Calif., March 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property, and\u00a0real estate data,\u00a0today released its Q1 2024 Single-Family Rental Market report, which ranks the best U.S. markets for buying single-family rental properties in 2024.\nThe report analyzed single-family rental returns in 341 U.S. counties with a population of at least 100,000 and sufficient rental and home price data. The analysis for this report incorporated median rents and median home prices collected from ATTOM's nationwide property database, as well as publicly recorded sales deed data licensed by ATTOM (see full methodology below).\n\nThe report shows that the average annual three-bedroom gross rental yield (annualized gross rent income divided by median purchase price) among the 341 counties analyzed is projected to be 7.55 percent in 2024. That is up slightly from an average of 7.39 percent in those same markets a year ago, marking the second year of rising projections after three years of declines.\nInvestment returns for landlords continue to increase as rents are going up slightly faster than home prices across a majority of the country. From 2023 to 2024, median three-bedroom rents rose more than median single-family home prices in 216, or 63 percent, of the markets analyzed. The gaps were small \u2013 usually less than one percentage point \u2013 but enough to push rental yields upward.\nThat has happened amid a combination of market forces spurring demand for rentals. They include a historically tight supply of homes for sale and home-price increases that have slowed but not enough to make buying widely affordable for average wage earners.\n\"The U.S. home sales market cooled off a good bit last year, with some of the weakest gains over the past decade. But that wasn't enough to make home prices affordable for most workers, which likely fed enough demand to push up rents and yields for investors who lease out single-family properties,\" said Rob Barber, CEO at ATTOM. \"The fact that so few homes are available for sale in many markets clearly further helped increase rental demand for landlords and boost their bottom lines.\"\nTop rental returns in Indian River, St. Lous, Cameron, Monroe and Richmond counties, as well as other parts of Midwest, Northeast and SouthCounties with the highest potential annual gross rental yields on three-bedroom properties for 2024 are Indian River County, FL, in the Sebastian-Vero Beach metro area (14.6 percent); St. Lous City, MO, (14.6 percent); Cameron County, TX, in the Brownsville-Harlingen metro area (13.2 percent); Monroe County, NY, in the Rochester metro area (12.8 percent) and Richmond County, GA, in the Augusta-Richmond County metro area (12.7 percent).\nThe highest potential annual three-bedroom gross rental yields in 2024 among counties with a population of at least 1 million are in Wayne County (Detroit), MI (12 percent); Allegheny County (Pittsburgh), PA (11.2 percent); Cuyahoga County (Cleveland), OH (10.2 percent); Cook County (Chicago), IL (10.1 percent) and Riverside County, CA (9.7 percent).\nRental returns increase across majority of nationPotential annual three-bedroom gross rental yields for 2024 have increased compared to 2023 in 216 of the 341 counties analyzed in the report (63 percent).

        "summary": "It was January 2019, and Keith Smith, a lifetime Chiefs fan, had landed tickets to the first AFC Championship Game in Kansas City's history.\nHe had spent the previous year documenting life with a journal, a therapist recommendation, and never did he find a more appropriate time to pen an entry. The essays typically had only one reader \u2014 himself \u2014 but he wrote that day with someone else in mind.\nHis father.\n'I wish,' Smith, now 47, recalled writing, 'you could be here.'\nThe most vivid childhood memories place Smith in the living room, his father decked out in Zubaz pants in the recliner alongside, their eyes fixated on a television that brought Chiefs games into their Moberly, Missouri home with a set of old-fashioned rabbit ears. They never missed a game, the axis around which their schedule revolved.\nEven as Smith grew older and eventually moved out, a postgame phone call became the understood replacement. They would talk for an hour on some occasions, the Chiefs a launching point into a conversation about kids, work and life \u2014 because that's what they had long considered the Chiefs.\nThe roots of a relationship that could sprouted in any direction.\nIn those days, the 'Todd Haley years,' Smith reminds, the phone calls offered an opportunity for his father to complain that the Chiefs had never been able to draft and develop the sport's most important position.\nHard to believe? Only if you're new here.\nAs one recent survey deemed the Chiefs the most hated team in America, which football-to-English translation paraphrases to the team of the most envy, there is a contingent of longtime Kansas Citians screaming a collective reply: Come on. Don't you get it \u2014 we were due for this.\nThe Chiefs sandwiched 27 quarterbacks between championships, 27 between Len Dawson and Patrick Mahomes, the guy who will lead them to their fourth Super Bowl appearance in five years Sunday, when they face the San Francisco 49ers here in Las Vegas.\nThey spanned 25 years between home playoff wins, back then an NFL franchise better known for heartbreak tales than their most prominent love stories.\nIn January 2018, a year before his AFC Championship Game trip from his home in Hays, Kansas, Smith was traveling to see his father to celebrate a birthday. It just so happened it would coincide with Mahomes' first career start in a season finale at Denver.\nBut on the road trip, Smith's phone rang. His father, in the midst of a battle with cancer, had been placed in a medically-induced coma. He would wake a day after Mahomes and the Chiefs beat the Broncos. With his father still drowsy and drugged up, as Smith described him, Smith leaned over.\n'Dad,' he said, 'this Mahomes guy might be it.'\n'Well,' his father replied. 'It's about damn time.'\nII.\nSarah Garrison, a 45-year-old in Kansas City, didn't learn of her pregnancy until she was nearly 12 weeks along. It was a few days before her husband's birthday, and realizing she didn't have much in the way of a gift, she wrapped a black-and-white ultrasound photo in a shoe box and waited for the reaction.\nShe swears by her memory of the word-for-word response.\n'No way! Another Chiefs fan!'\nGarrison shares that story with a sense of endearment, you should know, as though trying to one-up another fan's loyalty. But her reply then, in early 2013, represents a distinct era of Chiefs football.\n'Are we sure we want to subject them to that?' she asked.\nIII.\nThat was a different time \u2014 a time when the feeling of inevitability watching Chiefs playoff games meant something entirely different than it does today. A time when Chiefs fans braced for the worst, even though it did nothing to lessen the pain, and then mustered enough courage to do it all over again next year. A time when they pointed to hope rather than results.\nA time better known as Before Mahomes.\nIn their initial 55 years after moving to Kansas City, the Chiefs won eight playoff playoff games. In just six years with Mahomes as the starter, they've won 14, a chance to make it a fitting No. 15 on Sunday in Vegas.\nMahomes once said that after his first Super Bowl win, 'It all happened so fast .... I thought that's just kind of how it went.' And no comment could've better reflected his lack of time in Kansas City.\nIt was five years ago that Aaron Karst, a 33-year-old fan living Kansas City, told me his wife included in their wedding vows that she'd be there to console him after Chiefs losses \u2014 and that she meant it.\nA Chiefs fan's place atop NFL's mountain is not the result of spoils, but rather the reward of patience.\nOr maybe it's just the result of not realizing they had any other options. They equate their Chiefs fandom to religion \u2014 37-year-old Dylan Channel recalls rushing home from church to catch the noon kickoff. It is ingrained in the city as much as the Union Station lights turning red this time of year.\nIt is passed from generation to generation, from mothers and fathers to sons and daughters. From friends and neighbors. From, well, the moment you set foot in Kansas City.\nKarst's grandparents were Chiefs season-ticket holders when they played at Municipal Stadium. Then his parents joined at Arrowhead Stadium before he began to tag along. His dad gave him permission to cuss during the the old touchdown song \u2014 we're going to beat the hell out of you \u2014 so long as he didn't tell Mom.\nHe now hosts a tailgate of upwards of 70 people, providing food and drinks in exchange for a charity donation. That donation surpassed $14,000 this season. Mahomes, Karst said, tends to draw a bigger crowd.\nIn the initial 25 years of his fandom, Chiefs playoff games, which he attended, got nicknames for their ineptitude. He witnessed the no-punt game, the forward-progress game, the six-field-goal game. All losses.\nAnd, in retrospect...\n'All worth it,' he said.\nKarst, the man whose football team once put him through so much distress his wife felt it appropriate to bring up during their wedding ceremony, recently got a piece of advice from a childhood friend, a Patriots fan.\nThe topic? How to handle a dynasty.\n(Embrace the hate, by the way.)\nIV.\nAbout seven years ago, Overland Park resident Devin Rudicel was rolling through a thrift store in Youngstown, Ohio, when he stumbled upon a Ricky Stanzi jersey. Stanzi, mind you, was a quarterback who never threw a pass after the Chiefs selected him in the fifth round of the 2011 NFL Draft.\nThat's how these stories used to go.\nRudicel bought it anyway. And then a couple others. And then, well, it became an obsession. He has 119 of them now, logging that number in a spreadsheet, and part of his everyday routine is to check resale sites for another.\nThe most obscure, perhaps? A game-worn Tyler Palko jersey.\n'I don't think Tyler Palko even has a game-worn Tyler Palko jersey,' he quipped.\nThat collection started Before Mahomes.\nAfter Mahomes? Rudicel and his father have increased their travel budget. They attend two or three road games per season, including last week's AFC Championship Game in Baltimore.\n'I think we realized this is our moment,' Rudicel said. 'This is the greatest time to be a Chiefs fan.'\nOh, and there's this: 'We're smart enough to know this doesn't last forever.'\nRudicel and his father, Dave, have visited 13 road stadiums, and that includes the one in Miami Gardens, Florida, for Super Bowl LIV, the first Mahomes title. They cried when the clock hit zero. Stayed until every last piece of confetti had littered the field and every last player had left.\nWhen they returned to their hotel, they flipped on ESPN to relive it all over again. And again. And again. They watched Center on loop, long after the live broadcast had become a replay.\nAfter its last airing, they looked outside.\nThe sun had come up.\nV.\nFive years ago, this story focused on the playoff heartbreak. On why, after years of it, the fans kept coming back, season after season.\nThis subject line hit the inbox, formatted as a pitch for inclusion:\n30-something Chiefs fan living with unrelenting dread.\nA year before hitting send on that email, Eli Waterman had attended the Chiefs' playoff loss to the Titans, the last game his father, who introduced him to this fandom, had seen. He passed from cancer shortly after.\nThe last Championship Sunday \u2014 the dates for the AFC and NFC title matchups \u2014 that didn't include the Chiefs is the day his dad died.\n has changed. Waterman has three kids. He and his wife have moved from Raytown into their forever home in Blue Springs.\nBut there's still the Chiefs. That never changes. Waterman and his wife, Sarah, are the hosts for the football parties, which his kids adorably refer to as Chiefsday. They invite neighbor kids over. Friends. Cousins. It grows each year.\nDuring most games, Waterman says eyes his will move away from the TV and scan the room. There's a certain curative therapy to the exercise.\n'I'm looking at my kids, my wife, everyone, and I know if my dad were here, he'd be proud of me on so many different levels,' Waterman said, adding, 'As I watch the Chiefs, I want it to bring me closer to him.'\nVI.\nBrad Boan, 37, has been a plus-one to his father's season tickets for 34 years. Do the math on that. An Arrowhead Stadium regular since he was toddler.\nAs Sammy Watkins finished off a 60-yard touchdown in January 2020, the Chiefs' first AFC Championship Game victory in a half-century, Boan wrapped his arms around his dad.\n'It was just one of those moments where we've been to a lot of games where you just left numb,' Boan said. 'Getting to finally hug him at the end instead, it was a surreal moment.'\nThe viewing experience has changed. What he described five years ago this way \u2014 'As soon as the first thing goes wrong, you start to feel like, \u2018Here we go again'' \u2014 is now the feeling that it just might all work out in the end. And that if it doesn't, there truly is always next year.\nThe Mahomes Effect, Boan calls it.\nVII.\nAnother effect?\n\nThere are kids, some of them in grade school even, who have never known anything different than Patrick Mahomes. Who haven't a clue about the torment their fathers \u2014 and their fathers' fathers \u2014 experienced by claiming this team.\nBefore last weekend's AFC Championship Game, four years after celebrating the first of his lifetime with his father, Boan had to explain to 6-year-old Willie that, you know what, 'there's a chance they don't win this game and they're not going to play next week.'\nHe's not quite sure Willie understood.\nWaterman keeps a photo of his oldest, 7-year-old Atticus, biting his nails during the last Super Bowl.\nJesse Bates, a fan in West Plains, Missouri, recalls asking friends that, wouldn't it be something if they could just play in the Super Bowl once? His son, who just turned 6, jumped into his arms when the Chiefs beat Baltimore.\nThe 6-year-old will watch his fourth Super Bowl on Sunday.\nVIII.\nThe last Chiefs game William Rice attended with his father was the playoff loss to the Titans, the final chapter in the Before Mahomes period.\nThe Chiefs, an 8.5-point favorite, led 21-3 at halftime, only to be outscored 19-0 in the second half and lose. Rice recalls the devastation he felt while walking out of the stadium.\nHis father passed unexpectedly the next December, three weeks after doctors discovered pancreatic cancer. That was late into Mahomes' first year as a starter.\nRice has built the proverbial man cave into his home in San Antonio, Texas, and he has framed a photo of himself dressed in a Marcus Allen jersey when he was a baby. His parents always ensured their newborn had plenty of Chiefs outfits.\nHis dad got him started early. The elder Rice asked William's future mom out on a first date at a 10-year high school reunion. Wanted her to join him at a Chiefs game.\nThe Chiefs are playing a child's game in its truest sense, but it tightens lifetime bonds between friends and families, between parents and their kids. That's part of the lasting draw. Heck, for so many, that is the lasting draw. It is what kept them coming back, week after week, long before the winning made it a bit more enjoyable.\nIt's the connection to loved ones \u2014 both those here and those who have since passed. For Rice. For Waterman. And for Keith Smith, the man who led this story and who has journaled it all since his father slipped into a coma mere days before Mahomes took over.\nSmith's father died before watching No. 15 throwing a pass. Man, he wishes he could've seen this guy play.\nA few years ago, Smith received a gift from his wife: Zubaz pants. Just like his father wore.\nFor Christmas, his daughter upped the ante: Zubaz overalls.\nSmith has a new game-day outfit.\n'Some of the ugliest darn things I've ever seen,' Smith said. 'But I have to wear them.'\nRice, the San Antonio resident, recently visited Kansas City with his wife, who is 7 months pregnant. They took a tour of GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium over the holidays.\nBack home, he hung the picture of he and his father at their last Chiefs game together \u2014 the heart-wrenching playoff loss to the Titans \u2014 in the same room where he now watches on Sundays.\n'That game sucked,' he said, 'but it's now one of my fondest memories.'\nRice held a Super Bowl party four years ago, when Mahomes hoisted the Lombardi Trophy for the first time. After his friends left, his mom stayed behind.\nThey spent the next hour crying.\nOn the way out of Kansas City last Christmas, Rice and his wife made a stop at the team's pro shop. They wanted to make sure they stocked up on a couple of items.\nChiefs baby outfits.",

        "summary": "Flipping Activity by Investors Declines at Fastest Pace in 15 Years; Investment Returns on Flips Sink to Lowest Level Since 2007; Two-Thirds of Flipped Homes Still Purchased with Cash\nIRVINE, Calif., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property, and real estate data, today released its year-end 2023 U.S. Home Flipping Report, which shows that 308,922 single-family homes and condos in the United States were flipped in 2023. That was down 29.3 percent from 436,807 in 2022 \u2013 the largest annual drop since 2008.\nThe report further reveals that as the number of homes flipped by investors declined, so did flips as a portion of all home sales, from 8.6 percent in 2022 to 8.1 percent last year.\nIn yet another sign of down times for the home-flipping industry, profits and profit margins also sank on quick buy-renovate-and-resell projects.\nGross profits on typical home flips in 2023 dropped to $66,000 nationwide (the difference between the median sales price and the median amount originally paid by investors). That was down from $70,100 in 2022 and translated into just a 27.5 percent return on investment compared to the original acquisition price. The latest nationwide ROI (before accounting for mortgage interest, property taxes, renovation expenses and other holding costs) was down from 28.1 percent in 2022 and 35.7 percent in 2021, hitting the worst level since 2007.\nInvestors saw their profit margins decrease for the sixth time in the past seven years as the median price of the homes they flipped dipped slightly faster than the median price they had paid to purchase properties \u2013 4.4 percent versus 4 percent.\n\"In 2023, the landscape for home flipping across the U.S. became increasingly challenging,\" remarked Rob Barber, CEO at ATTOM. \"Whether the overall market has soared or seen just modest gains in recent years, investors have missed out on the action.\"\nHe added that \"the sharp decline in the number of home flips likely reflected a combination of a tight supply of homes for sale as well as dwindling returns. Either way, it will take some significant reworking of the financials for home flipping fortunes to turn back around.\"\nThe latest drop-off in home-flipping profits came during a year when the nation's decade-long home-price runup began to stall, leading to the weakest annual price gains since 2012 and a slight dip in profits for sellers of all kinds. But margins for home flippers had already been declining during earlier years when the broader housing market was booming. As that happened, the profit gap between investors and all sellers gradually widened.\nTypical returns in 2023 remained at levels that could easily be wiped out by the carrying costs during the renovation and repair process, which usually consume 20 to 33 percent of the resale price.\nHome flipping rates fall in most housing markets, with biggest decreases in the South and WestHome flips as a portion of all home sales decreased from 2022 to 2023 in 112 of the 212 metropolitan statistical areas analyzed in the report (53 percent). The top 25 largest decreases in annual flipping rates all were in the South and West. They were led by Gainesville, GA (rate down from 15.1 percent in 2022 to 9.9 percent in 2023); Phoenix, AZ (down from 16.3 percent to 11.9 percent); Prescott, AZ (down from 9.8 percent to 6 percent); Charlotte, NC (down from 14.2 percent to 10.6 percent) and Provo, UT (down from 10.9 percent to 7.5 percent).\nAside from Phoenix and Charlotte, the biggest decreases in flipping rates from 2022 to 2023 in metro areas with a population of 1 million or more were in Las Vegas, NV (rate down from 12.2 percent to 8.9 percent); Sacramento, CA (down from 9.9 percent to 6.9 percent) and Tucson, AZ (down from 14.6 percent to 11.8 percent).\nMetro areas where home flipping rates increased from 2022 to 2023 were led by Macon, GA (rate up from 12.1 percent to 17 percent); Gulfport, MS (up from 3.9 percent to 7.7 percent); Jackson, MS (up from 5.8 percent to 8.4 percent); Columbus, GA (up from 10.9 percent to 13.5 percent) and Dayton, OH (up from 10 percent to 12.4 percent).\nHome flips purchased with financing tick upwardNationally, the percentage of flipped homes originally purchased by investors with financing increased in 2023 to 36.5 percent, up from 35.7 percent in 2022 and from 36.2 percent in 2021.\nU.S. Home Flipping Financing Trends\nMeanwhile, 63.5 percent of homes flipped in 2023 were originally bought with cash only, down from 64.3 percent in 2022 and from 63.8 percent two years earlier.\nAmong metropolitan areas with a population of 1 million or more and sufficient data to analyze, those with the highest percentage of flipped homes purchased by investors with financing in 2023 included San Diego, CA (56.4 percent); Seattle, WA (56.1 percent); Fresno, CA (52.2 percent); Providence, RI (49.2 percent) and Boston, MA (48.6 percent).\nIn that same group, the metro areas with the highest percentage of flips purchased with all cash included Detroit, MI (81.6 percent); Cleveland, OH (76.3 percent); Buffalo, NY (75.5 percent); Pittsburgh, PA (71.1 percent) and Birmingham, AL (70.2 percent).\nTypical gross profits on home flips decline in nearly two-thirds of nationHomes flipped in 2023 were sold for a median price nationwide of $306,000, generating a gross flipping profit of $66,000 above the median original purchase price paid by investors of $240,000. That national gross-profit figure was down from $70,100 in 2022 and from $75,000 in 2021, which was the highest level this century.\nU.S. Home Flipping Gross Profits\nAmong the 56 metro areas in the U.S. with a population of 1 million or more, those with the largest gross flipping profits on median-priced transactions in 2023 were San Jose, CA ($275,250); San Francisco, CA ($170,000); Boston, MA ($158,000); New York, NY ($154,750) and San Diego, CA ($153,000).\nThe weakest gross flipping profits among metro areas with a population of at least 1 million in 2023 were in Austin, TX ($18,640 loss); San Antonio, TX ($12,289 profit); Dallas, TX ($14,817 profit); Houston, TX ($16,932 profit) and Phoenix, AZ ($25,000 profit).\nHome flipping returns fall in two-thirds of metro-area marketsThe profit margin on the typical home flips in the U.S. last year fell to 27.5 percent - the smallest investment return since 2007. The ROI on median-priced home flips nationwide has dropped 18 percentage points since 2020 and is off by 27 points since 2016.\nMargins fell again last year as the median nationwide resale price on flipped homes went down 4.4 percent, from $320,000 in 2022 to $306,000 in 2023. That represented a slightly larger decrease than the 4 percent dip in the price investors had originally paid for properties they flipped ($249,900 in 2022 versus $240,000 in 2023).\nAmong metro areas with a population of 1 million or more, the biggest percentage-point decreases in profit margins during 2023 were in Pittsburgh, PA (ROI down from 149.8 percent in 2022 to 105.3 percent in 2023); Buffalo, NY (down from 125.2 percent to 87.4 percent); Oklahoma City, OK (down from 57.6 percent to 43.7 percent); Richmond, VA (down from 88.3 percent to 75.1 percent) and Austin, TX (down from a 9 percent profit to a 4.1 percent loss).\nIn that same group of markets with populations of at least 1 million, the largest increases in returns on investment for typical home flips came in Cincinnati, OH (ROI up from 40.5 percent in 2022 to 59.6 percent in 2023); Cleveland, OH (up from 39.5 percent to 54.7 percent in 2023); Honolulu, HI (up from 15.3 percent to 27 percent); Sacramento, CA (up from 9.5 percent to 19.6 percent) and Hartford, CT (up from 48.5 percent to 56.4 percent).\nAmong metro areas with a population of at least 1 million, the biggest gross profit margins in 2023 were in Pittsburgh, PA (105.3 percent); Buffalo, NY (87.4 percent); Baltimore, MD (75.5 percent); Richmond, VA (75.1 percent) and Philadelphia, PA (74.3 percent). The worst came in Austin TX (4.1 percent loss); Dallas, TX (4.4 percent profit); San Antonio, TX (5 percent profit); Salt Lake City, UT (6.2 percent profit) and Houston, TX (6.2 percent profit).\nAverage time to flip nationwide increasesHome flippers who sold homes in 2023 took an average of 169 days, or about 5 \u00bd months, to complete the flips. That was up from 165 days for homes flipped in 2022 and 158 days in 2021.\nU.S. Average Days to Flip\nFHA buyers purchase larger portion of flipped homesOf the 308,922 U.S. homes flipped in 2023, 10.8 percent, or one of every nine, were sold to buyers using a loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). That was up from 8.3 percent in 2022, or one in 12, and from 8.1 percent in 2021.\nAmong the 212 metro areas with a population of at least 200,000 and at least 100 home flips in 2023, those with the highest percentage of flipped homes sold in 2023 to FHA buyers \u2014 typically first-time homebuyers \u2014 were Merced, CA (29.3 percent); Modesto, CA (25 percent); Visalia, CA (24.7 percent); Bakersfield, CA (24.6 percent) and Kennewick, WA (23.7 percent).\nNearly 200 counties had a home flipping rate of at least 10 percent in 2023Among 866 counties with at least 50 home flips in 2023, there were 198 where flips accounted for at least 10 percent of all home sales last year. The top five were all in Georgia: Cobb County (Marietta) (22.4 percent); Bibb County (Macon) (18.6 percent); Douglas County (outside Atlanta) (18.4 percent); Houston County (Warner Robins) (18 percent) and Clayton County (outside Atlanta) (17.2 percent).\nHigh-level takeaways from fourth-quarter 2023 data:\nThe 65,656 home flips in the fourth quarter of 2023 were completed by 52,701 investors, a ratio of 1.25 flips per investor.\nThe share of homes flipped in the fourth quarter of 2023 that were purchased by investors with financing represented 36.1 percent of all homes flipped in the quarter, down from 37.2 percent in the previous quarter but up from 34.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. The share purchased with cash rose to 63.9 percent, up from 62.8 percent in the third quarter of 2023 but down from 65.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThe gross-flipping profit on median-priced home flips in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $65,000, down from $68,154 in the third quarter but up from $59,900 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The latest figure represented a typical 27.7 percent return on investment (percentage of original purchase price). That was down from 28.8 percent in the previous quarter but up from 24.4 percent in the same period of 2022.\nThe quarterly decrease in the ROI \u2013 common during that time period each year - followed gains in the second and third quarters of 2023.\nHome flips completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 took an average of 156 days, down from 165 days in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nReport methodologyATTOM analyzed sales deed data for this report. A single-family home or condo flip was any arms-length transaction that occurred in the quarter where a previous arms-length transaction on the same property had occurred within the last 12 months. The average gross flipping profit is the difference between the purchase price and the flipped price (not including rehab costs and other expenses incurred, which flipping veterans estimate typically run between 20 percent and 33 percent of a property's after-repair value). Gross flipping return on investment was calculated by dividing the gross flipping profit by the first sale (purchase) price.\nAbout ATTOMATTOM provides premium property data to power products that improve transparency, innovation, efficiency, and disruption in a data-driven economy.

        "summary": "VANCOUVER, BC, March 26, 2024 /CNW/ - Nevada King Gold Corp. (TSXV: NKG) (OTCQX: NKGFF) (\"Nevada King\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to report results from an extensive Phase I metallurgical testing program at the Atlanta Gold Mine Project, located in the prolific Battle Mountain Trend, 264km northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The objective of the Phase I program was to test the various mineralized host rocks at Atlanta for gold and silver extraction, using conventional flowsheet unit operations to guide in selecting a process flowsheet suitable for the commercial extraction of gold and silver from the project. Results of the Phase I test work support strong recoveries utilizing conventional Nevada oxide processing methods for the representative mineralization types present at Atlanta.\nHighlights:\nPhase I testing used three surface bulk samples and 19 composites from drill core comprising the full range of rock types and gold and silver grades encountered across Atlanta. Mineralization at Atlanta can be broadly characterized by two major host domains: 1) Silicified breccias found within and below the main Atlanta unconformity, and 2) Volcanics found above the main Atlanta unconformity (refer to cross sections A-A and B-B in Figures 3-4 below).\nResults of Phase I support conventional Nevada oxide processing methods for Atlanta whereby:\nSilicified breccias are amenable to conventional milling for high-grade material and High-Pressure Grinding Roll (\"HPGR\") crushing and heap leaching for the lower-grade material.\nVolcanics are amenable to conventional milling for high-grade material and Conventional Crush or Run-of-Mine (\"ROM\") heap leaching for the lower-grade material.\nApplicable to process plant scenarios, gold extraction from fine milling at a 200-mesh grind (P80=75\u00b5m) show a weighted average extraction of 91.7% for gold hosted in volcanics and 85.9% for the high-grade silica breccias.\nSilver extraction from fine milling at a 200-mesh grind (P80=75\u00b5m) show a weighted average 65.3% in the volcanics and 41.3% in the silica breccias. At coarser crush size silver extractions are similar between the two metallurgical domains.\nApplicable to heap leach scenarios, gold extraction from conventional crushing (P80=12.5 mm) shows a weighted average extraction of 87.1% for gold hosted in volcanics. Gold extraction from HPGR crushed composites (using medium press force) shows a weighted average 71.4% extraction from low-grade silica breccias.\nA Phase 2 metallurgical PQ core drilling program has now been completed to fill some gaps in the target resource envelope and further laboratory testing utilizing material from this drilling is scheduled to start later in 2024. The location of these holes can be found in the drill hole plan map below in Figure 2.\nBulk Sample and Phase 1 metallurgical test work at Atlanta has been supervised by Gary Simmons (MMSA QP Number: 01013QP), formerly the Director of Metallurgy and Technology for Newmont Mining Corp. Mr. Simmons has supervised and managed numerous Carlin-style metallurgical testing programs in the Great Basin with characteristics similar to those found at Atlanta.\nMr. Simmons commented, \"Historic production at Atlanta focused on near-surface high-grade silica breccia ores that were processed and recovered using conventional oxide milling practices. Historical records (1979-85) indicate recoveries from the silica breccias necessitated a fine-grind milling and Merrill-Crowe recovery process that averaged 81% for gold and 42% for silver at ball mill grind P80 = 120\u00b5m (microns). This historical milling operation was challenged by the hard and abrasive nature of the silica breccias, resulting in elevated-maintenance and operating costs in primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing circuits.\n\"Today's results confirm that conventional oxide milling, and HPGR crush heap-leach or ROM heap-leach, depending on mineralization type, are well suited for processing gold and silver mineralization at Atlanta. Referring to a conceptual Atlanta generalized flowsheet in Figure 1 below, a straightforward process breaks out the host mineralization into their respective silica breccia and volcanic units, running high-grade mineralization through a mill and processing lower grade material via a combination HPGR crush and ROM heap leaching. The adoption of HPGR crushing technology (used at other mines in Nevada and around the world) will eliminate SAG milling of silica breccias and high-grade volcanics that in turn should result in reduced overall operating cost against a conventional SABC (Semi-Autogenous-Ball Mill-Crusher) circuit design. It is anticipated that this process will be more cost-effective than historical methods, resulting in lower process cutoff grades and potential for economic extraction of gold and silver from a larger volume of material.\"\nCollin Kettell, Founder & CEO of Nevada King, stated, \"Positive results from the Phase 1 metallurgical test work released today indicate a clear path forward for processing Atlanta's gold and silver mineralization via a combination of crushed and run-of-mine heap leaching together with conventional milling of high-grade mineralization. In a major departure from historical processing and test-work at Atlanta, the potential for using HPGR crushing, as indicated by Phase 1 enhanced test recoveries, could result in very significant benefits and opportunities for flow sheet development in a future potential mining operation. Test results also indicate significantly higher Au/Ag recoveries in the volcanic section, which is fast becoming a major component of the overall mineralized footprint at Atlanta. Looking forward, ongoing resource modeling and metallurgical studies will focus on optimizing the potential economics of mining and processing scenarios utilizing the alternative process options for which this Phase 1 testing program has indicated positive extraction results.\"\nTest Results Summary:\nAtlanta mineralized resources have been characterized into two major resource categories for gold and silver processing: 1. Silicified breccias (mineralized material in and below the main Atlanta unconformity) and Volcanics (mineralized material above the main Atlanta unconformity).\nA breakout of the materials tested above and below the Atlanta unconformity and the laboratory metallurgy gold extraction test results are summarized in Table 1. A full range of rock types at Atlanta have been tested and test results clearly show the significant metallurgical difference between the silicified breccias and the volcanics. A similar table summarizing silver extractions for Atlanta can be found in Table 2.\nSilicified breccias, below the unconformity, are hard and abrasive rocks and have a high degree of sensitivity to process feed particle size.\nVictory Metals, Inc. (Nevada King Gold Corp.) NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Atlanta Project dated December 22, 2020, reported historic Atlanta mill recoveries, for the years 1979-85 at 81% for Au and 42% for Ag, at operating ball mill grind P80 = 120\u00b5m (microns).\nSilicified breccias are amenable to High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) comminution, where high-grade would report to a mill and lower-grade to heap leaching. The determination between higher-grade and lower-grade material will be dependent upon future economic analysis.\nOf significant note is that as the silica breccia gold grade decreases (<1.7 ppm Au), gold extraction increases at coarser P80 particle size, as shown in Table 1. Thus, reinforcing the benefit of milling higher grade and HPGR crush-heap leaching of the lower grade resources.\nVolcanics, above the unconformity, are relatively insensitive to process feed particle size and can be characterized as equal or similar to central Nevada commercial heap leach operations.\nVolcanics are amenable to conventional milling, conventional crush heap leaching and/or ROM heap leaching.\nGold extraction from fine milling at a 200 mesh grind (P80=75\u00b5m) show a weighted average:\n91.7% extraction in the volcanics\n87.5 % extraction in the low-grade silica breccias\n85.9% extraction in the high-grade silica breccias\nGold extraction from conventional crushing (P80=12.5 mm) show a weighted average:\n87.1% extraction from volcanics\n62.1% extraction from low-grade silica breccias\n37.0% extraction from high grade silica breccias\nGold extraction from HPGR crushed composites show a weighted average:\n81.9% extraction from volcanics (only four of the nine volcanic composites were tested using HPGR as the remaining five composites contained elevated levels fines and are not suitable for HPGR processing)\n71.4% extraction from low-grade silica breccias (<1.7 ppm Au)\n50.4% extraction from high-grade silica breccias\nGold Met Balances\nKCASample No.\nComp ID\nUnconf*1 Abv/Below\nAtlanta Geology\n37\u00b5m BR\n75\u00b5m BR\n1,700\u00b5m BR\n12.5mm Column\n25.0mm Column\nHPGR Column\nFormation\nSubunit\nAu Ext %\nCalc Hd Au (ppm)\nAu Ext %\nCalc Hd Au (ppm)\nAu Ext %\nCalc Hd Au (ppm)\nAu Et %\nCalc Hd Au (ppm)\nAu Ext %\nCalc HdAu (ppm)\nAu Ext%\nCalc Hd Au (ppm)\n96607 A\nATV-3\nAbove\nVolInt\nQtz latite porph, Int.\n83.4\n1.820\n86.5\n1.823\n64.6\n1.941\n70.3\n1.874\n75.5\n1.979\n96609 A\nATV-5\nAbove\nTww\nVolc.

Silver Metallurgical Results, Bottle Roll & Column Leach Tests\nQA/QC Protocols\nAll PQ-diameter core for the Phase 1 testing program was \u00bc cut with a diamond saw, with the \u00bc sample being sent to American Assay Lab in Reno, Nevada, while the \u00be samples were sent to Kappes and Cassiday Associates, also in Reno. Samples were cut under the Company's supervision in its Winnemucca, Nevada, warehouse and all samples were placed in heavy canvas bags. CRF standards and coarse blanks were inserted into the sample stream on a one-in-twenty sample basis, meaning both inserts are included in each 20-sample group. Samples were shipped by a local contractor in large sample shipping crates directly to American Assay Lab in Reno, Nevada, with full custody being maintained at all times. At American Assay Lab, samples were weighted then crushed to 75% passing 2mm and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns in order to produce a 300g pulverized split. Prepared samples are initially run using a four acid + boric acid digestion process and conventional mutli-element ICP-OES analysis. Gold assays are initially run using 30-gram samples by lead fire assay with an OES finish to a 0.003 ppm detection limit, with samples greater than 10 ppm finished gravimetrically. Every sample is also run through a cyanide leach for gold with an ICP-OES finish. The QA/QC procedure involves regular submission of Certified Analytical Standards and property-specific duplicates.\nQualified Person\nThe geological information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Calvin R. Herron, P.Geo., who is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\"). Mr. Herron is not independent for purposes of NI 43-101 as he is Exploration Manager of Nevada King.\nAbout Nevada King Gold Corp.\nNevada King is the third largest mineral claim holder in the State of Nevada, behind Nevada Gold Mines (Barrick/Newmont) and Kinross Gold. Starting in 2016 the Company has staked large project areas hosting significant historical exploration work along the Battle Mountain trend located close to current or former producing gold mines. These project areas were initially targeted based on their potential for hosting multi-million ounce gold deposits and were subsequently staked following a detailed geological evaluation. District-scale projects in Nevada King's portfolio include (1) the 100% owned Atlanta Mine, located 100km southeast of Ely, (2) the Lewis and Horse Mountain-Mill Creek projects, both located between Nevada Gold Mines' large Phoenix and Pipeline mines, and (3) the Iron Point project, located 35km east of Winnemucca, Nevada.\nThe Atlanta Mine is a historical gold-silver producer with a NI 43-101 compliant pit-constrained resource of 460,000 oz Au in the measured and indicated category (11.0M tonnes at 1.3 g/t) plus an inferred resource of 142,000 oz Au (5.3M tonnes at 0.83 g/t).

        "summary": "Interim clinical data update on ACTengine\u00ae IMA203 GEN1 (PRAME) in melanoma at RP2D in November 2023: 50% confirmed objective response rate with median duration of response not reached at median follow-up of 14.4 months; IMA203 was well tolerated\nRegistration-enabling randomized Phase 2/3 trial for ACTengine\u00ae IMA203 GEN1 in 2L+ melanoma planned to begin in 2024\nNext data update on IMA203 GEN1 and IMA203CD8 GEN2 planned for 2H 2024\nFirst clinical data updates for Immatics' next-generation TCR Bispecifics, TCER\u00ae IMA401 (MAGEA4/8) and TCER\u00ae IMA402 (PRAME), from ongoing Phase 1 dose escalation trials planned for 2H 2024; updates to include details on safety, pharmacokinetics and initial anti-tumor activity\nIn May 2023, Bristol Myers Squibb exercised first opt-in into the autologous cell therapy collaboration ($15 million option fee received) and made a $35 million equity investment in July 2023\nIn September 2023, Immatics and Moderna announced a strategic multi-platform collaboration to develop innovative oncology therapeutics; Immatics received $120 million upfront payment, and the total deal volume could exceed $1.7 billion\n$201.5 million public offering completed on January 22, 2024\nCash and cash equivalents as well as other financial assets amount to $470.6 million1 (\u20ac425.9 million) as of December 31, 2023. Addition of proceeds from the public offering in January 2024 results in projected cash runway into 2027\nHouston, Texas and Tuebingen, Germany, March 21, 2024 \u2013 Immatics N.V. (NASDAQ: IMTX, 'Immatics'), a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company active in the discovery and development of T cell-redirecting cancer immunotherapies, today provided a business update and reported financial results for the quarter and full year ended December 31, 2023.\n'Immatics kicked off 2024 with a successful capital raise, providing significant financial runway and additional momentum to advance our ongoing clinical cell therapy and bispecific trials,' said Harpreet Singh, Ph.D., CEO and Co-Founder of Immatics. 'We are striving to reach multiple relevant milestones this year, including announcing clinical proof-of-concept for our half-life extended TCR Bispecifics platform. In parallel, the clinical data for our PRAME cell therapy, IMA203 GEN1, in conjunction with highly constructive FDA discussions, reinforces our confidence in advancing this asset toward a registration-enabling Phase 2/3 clinical trial in melanoma, while laying the groundwork to transition into a fully equipped commercial-stage company.'\nFull Year 2023 and Subsequent Company Progress\nACTengine\u00ae IMA203 (PRAME)\nClinical development plan update for ACTengine\u00ae IMA203 GEN1 and IMA203CD8 GEN2 monotherapies\nFollowing an RMAT designation in October 2023 and productive interactions with the FDA, Immatics plans to initiate a registration-enabling randomized Phase 2/3 trial in 2024 for IMA203 GEN1 in patients with second-line or later (2L+) cutaneous melanoma, potentially including also uveal melanoma patients.\nImmatics intends to assess IMA203 GEN1 targeting PRAME in HLA-A*02:01-positive cutaneous melanoma patients versus a control arm. This single trial will be designed to support accelerated approval based on an interim readout and full approval based on overall survival. The high prevalence of PRAME (\u226595%) in cutaneous melanoma may enable the company to enroll patients without PRAME pre-testing. This would enhance trial operations and could remove the need to develop a companion diagnostic in this indication. The full trial design is currently being developed and is subject to further alignment with the FDA as part of the ongoing discussions. The Phase 2/3 trial is planned to start in 2024.\nFor IMA203CD8 GEN2, Immatics cleared dose level 4a (DL4a, up to ~1.6x109 TCR-T cells) in December 2023, which is currently intended to be the target dose for further development. In addition to treating melanoma patients, Immatics has also started to expand its clinical footprint outside of melanoma to address a broader patient population with a particular focus on ovarian and uterine cancers.\nA next data update for both Phase 1b cohorts with IMA203 GEN1 and IMA203CD8 GEN2 is planned for 2H 2024.\nManufacturing capabilities\nImmatics' late-stage clinical cell therapy development is supported by its streamlined manufacturing timeline, capabilities and facility. IMA203 GEN1 and IMA203CD8 GEN2 cell therapy products are manufactured within 7 days followed by a 7-day QC release testing at a success rate of >95% to reach the target dose (IMA203 GEN1: RP2D; IMA203CD8: DL4a). The company has also recently completed construction of a ~100,000 square foot R&D and GMP manufacturing facility with a modular design for efficient and cost-effective scalability to serve early-stage and registration-enabling clinical trials, as well as potential initial commercial supply.\nInterim clinical data update on ACTengine\u00ae IMA203 GEN1 and IMA203CD8 GEN2 monotherapies, as of November 2023\nOn November 8, 2023, Immatics provided an interim clinical update from the ongoing Phase 1 trial with ACTengine\u00ae IMA203 targeting PRAME in patients with recurrent and/or refractory solid cancers (data cut-off September 30, 2023). The update was focused on IMA203 GEN1 in melanoma patients at the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D, 1.0-10x109 total TCR-T cells) and the first clinical data for IMA203CD8 GEN2.\nTreatment with IMA203 GEN1 monotherapy (consisting of PRAME-specific functional CD8+ cells) in Phase 1a and Phase 1b Cohort A at RP2D demonstrated durable objective responses in melanoma patients with one patient exceeding 12 months and two patients exceeding 15 months post infusion and a 50% (6/12) confirmed objective response rate (cORR). Median duration of response (mDOR) was not reached (min 2.2+ months, max 14.7+ months) at a median follow-up (mFU) of 14.4 months. In line with previous results, IMA203 GEN1 monotherapy was well tolerated at total doses of up to 10x109 TCR-T cells infused.\nIn addition, the first data on the company's second-generation product candidate IMA203CD8 (consisting of PRAME-specific functional CD8+ and CD4+ cells) demonstrated 56% (5/9) cORR with enhanced pharmacology compared to IMA203 GEN1. mDOR was not reached (min 2.0+ months, max 11.5+ months) at a mFU of 4.8 months. As of the reported cut-off date, IMA203CD8 GEN2 exhibited a manageable tolerability profile.\nTCR Bispecifics Programs\nImmatics' T cell engaging receptor (TCER\u00ae) candidates are next-generation, half-life extended TCR Bispecific molecules. They are designed to achieve a patient-convenient dosing schedule and to maximize efficacy while minimizing toxicities in patients through the proprietary format using a high-affinity TCR domain against the tumor target and a low-affinity T cell recruiter binding to the T cell.\nUpcoming milestones for Immatics' clinical TCER\u00ae pipeline Immatics seeks to deliver clinical proof-of-concept for its novel TCER\u00ae platform as quickly as possible and plans to provide first clinical data for IMA401 (MAGEA4/8) and IMA402 (PRAME) in 2H 2024.\nKey objectives include:\nDemonstrating tolerability of the novel, next-generation, half-life extended TCR Bispecifics format;\nOptimizing dosing schedule to a less frequent regimen already during dose escalation, based on pharmacokinetics data;\nDemonstrating initial clinical anti-tumor activity (i.e., confirmed objective responses according to RECIST 1.1).\nTCER\u00ae IMA401 (MAGEA4/8) \u2013 The Phase 1 trial to evaluate safety, tolerability and initial anti-tumor activity of TCER\u00ae IMA401 in patients with recurrent and/or refractory solid tumors is ongoing. IMA401 targets an HLA-A*02:01-presented peptide that occurs identically in two different proteins, MAGEA4 and MAGEA8. This target peptide has been selected based on natural expression in native solid tumors at particularly high target density (peptide copy number per tumor cell identified by Immatics' proprietary quantitative mass spectrometry engine XPRESIDENT\u00ae). MAGEA4 and MAGEA8 are expressed in multiple solid cancers including lung cancer, head and neck cancer, melanoma, ovarian cancer, sarcoma and others. IMA401 is being developed in collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb. First clinical data in at least 25 patients in dose escalation across multiple solid cancers is expected to be announced in 2H 2024.\nTCER\u00ae IMA402 (PRAME) \u2013 Immatics initiated the Phase 1/2 trial investigating the company's fully owned TCER\u00ae candidate IMA402 in patients with recurrent and/or refractory solid tumors in August 2023 and the first patients have been dosed. Initial focus indications are ovarian cancer, lung cancer, uterine cancer, and cutaneous and uveal melanoma, among others. IMA402 targets an HLA-A*02:01-presented peptide derived from the tumor antigen PRAME. This target peptide has been selected based on natural expression in native solid primary tumors and metastases at particularly high target density (peptide copy number per tumor cell identified by Immatics' proprietary quantitative mass spectrometry engine XPRESIDENT\u00ae). Immatics has recently engaged with a CDMO for the manufacturing of clinical IMA402 batches for its use within a potential registration-enabling trial. Patient recruitment and dose escalation continue to scale. First clinical data in at least 15 patients in dose escalation across multiple solid cancers, but initially focused on melanoma, is anticipated to be announced in 2H 2024.\nCorporate Development\nOn January 22, 2024, Immatics completed an offering of 18,313,750 ordinary shares at a public offering price of $11.00 per share. The gross proceeds from the offering, before deducting the underwriting discount and offering expenses, were approximately $201.5 million.\nIn January 2024, Immatics hired Jason Braun as Senior Vice President Commercial to support the company as it transitions into a fully equipped commercial-stage entity and targets the initiation of a registration-enabling Phase 2/3 trial for its PRAME TCR-T cell therapy. Jason Braun joins the company with more than 20 years of experience in the biotech and pharma industry, having worked with several biopharmaceutical companies including Amgen, Dendreon, Pharmacyclics (Abbvie), Kite (Gilead) and Nkarta, among others. During his career, he has established a successful track record in the commercialization of oncology drug candidates.\nOn September 11, 2023, Immatics announced a strategic multi-platform collaboration with Moderna, combining Immatics' target and TCR platforms with Moderna's cutting-edge mRNA technology. The collaboration spans various therapeutic modalities including bispecifics, cell therapy and cancer vaccines. Under the terms of the agreement, Immatics received an upfront payment of $120 million. In addition, Immatics will receive research funding and is eligible to receive development, regulatory and commercial milestone payments that could exceed $1.7 billion.\nOn July 24, 2023, Bristol Myers Squibb made a $35 million equity investment in Immatics, purchasing 2,419,818 ordinary shares in a private placement transaction at a subscription price per share of $14.46.\nIn May 2023, Bristol Myers Squibb exercised its first option and entered into a global license agreement with Immatics for the most advanced TCR-T product candidate. As part of the agreement, Immatics received an option payment of $15 million and is eligible for up to $490 million in milestone payments in addition to tiered royalties on net sales of the product.\nFull Year 2023 Financial Results\nCash Position: Cash and cash equivalents as well as other financial assets total \u20ac425.9 million ($470.6 million1) as of December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac362.2 million ($400.2 million1) as of December 31, 2022. The increase is mainly due to upfront payments for collaborations, partly offset by our ongoing research and development activities. This does not include the net proceeds received in January 2024 from the public offering. Adding these proceeds, the company currently projects a cash runway into 2027.\nRevenue: Total revenue, consisting of revenue from collaboration agreements, was \u20ac54.0 million ($59.7 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac172.8 million ($190.9 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease is mainly the result of a one-time revenue for the license portion of the IMA401 collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nResearch and Development Expenses: R&D expenses were \u20ac118.7 million ($131.2 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac106.8 million ($118.0 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The increase mainly resulted from costs associated with the advancement of the clinical pipeline of ACTengine\u00ae and TCER\u00ae candidates.General and Administrative Expenses: G&A expenses were \u20ac38.2 million ($42.2 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to \u20ac36.1 million ($39.9 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nNet Profit and Loss: Net loss was \u20ac97.0 million ($107.2 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2023, compared to a net profit of \u20ac37.5 million ($41.4 million1) for the year ended December 31, 2022. The decrease of net profit resulted mainly from the one-time license fee income in connection with the IMA401 collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb, as well as the recognition of remaining deferred revenue in connection with the termination of the GSK collaboration for the year ended December 31, 2022.\nFull financial statements can be found in the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and published on the SEC website under www.sec.gov.\nUpcoming Investor Conferences\nBank of America Health Care Conference, Las Vegas (NV) \u2013 May 14 - 16, 2024\nJefferies Global Healthcare Conference, New York (NY) \u2013 June 5 - 7, 2024\nTo see the full list of events and presentations, visit www.investors.immatics.com/events-presentations.\n- END -\nAbout ImmaticsImmatics combines the discovery of true targets for cancer immunotherapies with the development of the right T cell receptors with the goal of enabling a robust and specific T cell response against these targets.

        "excerpt": "The city is now home to Brewery Row, a cluster of five breweries within just a few blocks of each other, with a sixth a short eight-minute drive away.",
        "summary": "Allegiant Stadium, home field of the Las Vegas Raiders, will host Super Bowl LVIII. Although the big game is on February 11, 2024, fans of the National Football League will converge on Sin City for official events beginning on February 5. While Las Vegas is famous for casinos, gambling and shows, it is also a culinary capital, including being home to a number of craft breweries.\n\nHere are some great taprooms to visit while in Las Vegas, either for the biggest football game of the year, or your next adult getaway.\n\nBrewery Row\n\nLike many cities, craft beer has boomed in recent years in Las Vegas. The city is now home to Brewery Row, a cluster of five breweries within just a few blocks of each other, with a sixth brewery just a short, eight-minute drive away. Brewery Row is just a 15-minute car ride from The Strip, in the Las Vegas Arts District.\n\nAble Baker Brewing\n\nAble Baker gets its name from the first two atomic bombs detonated at the Nevada Test Site. Legend has it that the only animal to survive the atomic tests was a duck, so ducks feature heavily in Able Baker's d\u00e9cor - sampler trays are in the shape of a duck footprint and feature a decorative rubber duckie. The taproom features 32 taps (!) so there is something for everyone.\n\nNevada Brew Works\n\nNevada Brew Works has no 'core' beers. Instead, they offer an ever-changing line-up of house-made brews. But Nevada Brew Works is not just beer. Brick-oven pizzas and gourmet burgers are on the food menu and they feature an extensive list of whiskies.\n\nHUDL Brewing\n\nHUDL opened its doors to the thirsty Las Vegas public in October 2020. The taproom is a great place to 'HUDL UP' with friends and family, they like to say. 'Every beer has it's own unique character,' says Skip Norfolk, co-founder. 'You will experience four different IPAs should you have an IPA flight. They will be different and unique.' The brewery is located next door to Soul Belly BBQ, so after a flight of beers, there is a great destination for a bite before the next brewery.\n\nCraftHaus Brewery\n\nThe Brewery Row location of CraftHaus is an outpost of their main brewery in Henderson, NV, which will be celebrating its 10th anniversary this year. The Brewery Row taproom features over two-dozen taps with as many as eight different IPAs, along with a broad selection of other styles of beer. CraftHaus also offers a non-alcoholic hop water.\n\nHop Nuts Brewing\n\nThe Hop Nuts taproom features eight core beers and an ever-changing line-up of seven more. Hop Nuts also offers a carefully-chosen selection of guest taps.\n\nTenaya Creek Brewery\n\nTenaya Creek is one of Nevada's early movers in craft beer, having opened in 1999. Their current location, just a short drive from Brewery Row opened in 2015. Tenaya Creek's beers are distributed broadly, winning awards as far away as Australia, but the Las Vegas taproom is where the beer is freshest.\n\nHofbrauhaus Las Vegas\n\nFrom the Paris's Eiffel Tower to the pyramids of Egypt, Las Vegas loves to recreate tourist destinations. For beer lovers, there are few venues more famous than Munich's iconic Hofbrauhaus beer hall.

        "summary": "Undisputed super middleweight\u00a0champion Saul 'Canelo' Alvarez (Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\n\nCanelo Alvarez just answered a ton of questions about his immediate future, including why he isn't facing super-middleweight contender David Benavidez in his next fight.\n \nThe Mexican icon's next bout will be on May 4 in Las Vegas at T-Mobile Arena. He will face his countryman Jaime Munguia at 168 pounds for Canelo's undisputed super middleweight title.\n \nThe fight will be a Premier Boxing Champions, Canelo, and Golden Boy co-promotion streamed live on DAZN.\n \nThere were talks that Canelo would leave his deal with PBC early, but an agreement was made to continue the pact, at least through this fight.\n \nThat's a significant portion of the news, but the Benavidez issue is the elephant in the room. TalkSport's Michael Benson asked Canelo about 'ducking' Benavidez, and \nthe all-time great responded\n.\n\n\n\n\nCanelo has a point.\n\n\nChampions of his ilk will always have challengers or those who aspire to get a piece of the pie. Floyd Mayweather was criticized for not fighting Antonio Margarito during his prime\u2013even though it seems later we learned that the fight probably wouldn't have been as competitive as some expected.\n\n\n\n\nThe same may be said for Canelo-Benavidez should they never meet in the ring. In any case, Canelo's decision to skip Benavidez for a fight with Munguia does seem like a risk-reward choice.\n\n\nMunguia is undefeated at 43-0, and he has seemingly been on a collision course with Canelo since he emerged on the scene as a top prospect at super welterweight in 2018. At 6 feet tall, Munguia was bound to outgrow 154 pounds, and he seems better suited to compete at 168 pounds, where making weight and feeling strong should be easier for the 27-year-old.\n \nThat said, most would be surprised if Munguia can defeat Canelo. Munguia's boxing acumen, speed, and punching accuracy would all seem inferior in this matchup.\n\n\nThe same may not be true for Benavidez if he got a shot at Canelo.\n \nLAS VEGAS, NEVADA - NOVEMBER 25: David Benavidez (L) connects with Demetrius Andrade in a WBC super \n... [+]\n middleweight title fight at Michelob ULTRA Arena on November 25, 2023 in Las Vegas, Nevada. Benavidez retained his title with a TKO. (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)\nGetty Images\n\n\nBenavidez is known as The Monster Bandera Roja, which translates to Red Flag. A matchup with Benavidez may have symbolized that to Canelo and his camp\u2013at least at this point in his career.\n\n\nBenavidez is 6-foot-2, and he's never fought at a weight lower than 167 pounds in his career. He is 28-0 with 24 KOs. Benavidez is coming off a destructive victory over the previously undefeated Demetrius Andrade, preceded by a unanimous-decision win over former 168-pound champion Caleb Plant.\n\n\nStylistically and physically, Benavidez looks like an opponent who could create serious issues for Canelo. Perhaps that's why Canelo didn't choose to face him next despite the public outcry for the fight.\n\n\nTo Canelo's point, he has fought everyone you could imagine, from 154 to 175 pounds up to this point. You could argue he has earned the right to be picky at this career stage.\n\n\nCanelo was once on the business end of an A-side fighter's decision. When he suffered a majority decision loss to Mayweather, Money chose to fight Canelo when the latter was just 23 years old. The fight was contested at a catchweight of 152 pounds, which made it more challenging for Canelo to make weight.\nLAS VEGAS, NV - SEPTEMBER 14: (L-R) Floyd Mayweather Jr. throws a right to Canelo Alvarez during \n... [+]\n their WBC/WBA 154-pound title fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena on September 14, 2013 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images)\n2013 Getty Images\n\n\nGolden Boy, Canelo's promoter at the time, elected to allow their fighter to compete and he was thoroughly outboxed. The one judge, CJ Ross who scored the fight 114-114, had a history of controversial score cards. \nShe stepped down as a judge\n following the bout.\n\n\nIn another similar instance of A-side behavior, \nTerence Crawford explained why he would prefer to face Canelo\n over the rising Jaron Ennis\u2013though Bud would seemingly match up better with Boots than Alvarez does with Benavidez.\n\n\nIn any case, if Canelo never faces Benavidez, it will be one of the few questions fans have about the career of one of the sport's greatest stars.",

        "summary": "Everyone knows casinos\u2014and sportsbooks by extension\u2014win against gamblers. However, once in a blue moon, gamblers get the upper hand.\n\nThe NFL Super Bowl is the pinnacle of the U.S. sports betting calendar, which means it's the most heavily bet sports game of the year. The Nevada Gaming Control Board has been tracking the gambling industry's results for the Big Game since 1991.\n\nSince 1991, Super Bowl gamblers as a whole have beaten the Nevada sportsbooks twice. As a win-loss record, the sportsbooks are 31-2 against the betting public for the Super Bowl since the record-keeping began. When it comes to a single sports event, the house doesn't always win.\n\nOver the past three-plus decades, Nevada sportsbooks have taken more than $3 billion in bets on the Super Bowl, holding about 8% of the handle in the form of winnings (about $250 million).\n\nWhen did bettors do well? Let's take a look.\n\nSuper Bowl 1995\n\nSports bettors wagered $69.59 million on Super Bowl XXIX between the San Francisco 49ers (13-3 in the regular season) and the San Diego Chargers (11-5).\n\nLed by future NFL Hall of Famers Steve Young and Jerry Rice, San Francisco won convincingly 49-26. The Niners were massive 18.5-point favorites, and they didn't disappoint.\n\nThe over/under on the total points was 53.5, so the total was easily cleared. The betting public prefers the over as it's generally more fun to root for a high-scoring game.\n\nNevada sportsbooks as a whole lost $396,674 for a -0.57% hold. It ultimately wasn't that big of a deal, as the Silver State sportsbooks still won $79.4 million from gamblers that year.\n\nSuper Bowl 2008\n\nNFL football gamblers wagered $92.1 million on Super Bowl XLII between the New England Patriots (16-0) and the New York Giants (10-6).\n\nLed by Eli Manning, New York pulled off the shocking upset 17-14. The Tom Brady-led Patriots were 12-point favorites after a perfect season until the loss.\n\nThe Over/Under on the total points was 55.\n\nNevada sportsbooks lost $2.57 million for a -2.80% hold. Despite the disappointing Super Bowl results, the books won $136.44 million from sports bets that year.\n\nBest Super Bowl For NV Sportsbooks\n\nThe sportsbooks almost had Super Bowl losses in 1992, 1998, 2011, and 2018, with less than 1% hold on the Big Game in each of those years. While gamblers sometimes do well, sometimes they are crushed.\n\nNevada sportsbooks won 17% of the betting handle on the 2005 Super Bowl, their highest hold percentage ever recorded for the contest.\n\nThat year, $90.75 million was bet on the Big Game, with industry winnings of $15.43 million.\n\nNew England beat the Philadelphia Eagles 24-21. The Patriots were favored by a touchdown.\n\nThe Over/Under was 46.5 points.\n\nThe Nevada books have had at least 10% hold for 10 Super Bowls since 1991.\n\nWhere to Bet on Super Bowl LVII\n\nThere are now more states with legal sports betting. You no longer have to be in Las Vegas to gamble legally on the Super Bowl.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles and the Kansas City Chiefs faced off on Feb. 12, 2023 in Arizona for all the marbles, with tens of millions of Americans able to place wagers. The Chiefs prevailed 38-35.\n\nNevada reported a 7.4% hold on the 2023 Super Bowl. About $153.1 million was bet, with the industry winning $11.2 million. The hold was close to the 30-year average on the Big Game.\n\nAt the time of Super Bowl LVIII in 2024, sports betting was live and legal in 38 states plus the District of Columbia, and 29 of those jurisdictions allow bets to be placed over the internet:",

The Tudor shield logo is displayed on the nose of the car in front of the driver and the inside of the halo safety device.\n\nIn addition, the drivers for the new team, Yuki Tsunoda and Daniel Ricciardo, were wearing the new uniform at the reveal, with the Tudor shield on the chest. Each were wearing a Tudor watch as well.\n\nFor Tudor being part of the world's largest and most popular racing program marks a return to motorsports. The brand supported winning teams starting with the Tudor Watch Racing Team in the late 1960s to the recent IMSA TUDO United SportsCar Championship.\n\nV-CARB has undergone a radical shake up since taking over the AlphaTauri team name. In addition to redesigning the livery and race suits, the new lead sponsors have made changes throughout the organization, from management to engineering.\n\nRed Bull's Italian Formula 1 team has competed in more than 350 races since it was founded. The team was launched as Scuderia Toro Rosso and charged with bringing future champions to the grid. It rebranded in 2020 as Scuderia AlphaTauri, with a victory at the Italian Grand Prix in its first season. The team under the V-CARB and Tudor sponsorship, will have an expanded mission to battle for the top spots in Formula 1 racing.\n\n'Tudor has always been fueled by a daring spirit, a consistent will to do things differently,' says Eric Pirson, Tudor CEO said in. a statement. 'And this spirit\u2014we call it \u2018Born to Dare'\u2014is exactly what Visa Cash App RB is demonstrating heading into the 2024 F1 season. We're beyond thrilled to return to motorsport with a partner that's ready to take on the challenge.'\n\nPeter Bayer, CEO of V-CARB added in the statement, 'The Swiss watch company has seized the opportunity to move up to the very pinnacle of motorsport, joining us, as we tackle the 2024 Formula 1 World Championship with our new Visa Cash App RB identity. Our team will be challenging the status quo in Formula 1 with a strong identity, unique style and uncompromising quality \u2013 just like Tudor watches.'",

        "summary": "Whether enjoyed frozen or on the rocks, or with sugar or salt, margaritas are a crowd favorite.\n\nMargaritas are so popular, in fact, that they have their very own national holiday. On February 22, we celebrate National Margarita Day \u2014 and there's loads of delicious variations on this classic cocktail to enjoy in honor of the occasion!\n\nPineapple Habanero Margarita\n\nThis take on a margarita starts with Santo Blanco Tequila, then amps up the sweet with pineapple and the spicy with habanero. 'While I love a simple, traditional margarita, sometimes I'm looking for a bit more complexity, particularly the juxtaposition of sweet & spicy. In this recipe, you start with a base of our additive-free, agave-forward Santo Blanco Tequila, then match it with a boost of sweetness from the pineapple and a kick of spice from the habanero. Crank up the heat as much or as little as you like\u2026I know you'll dig it!' said celebrity chef Guy Fieri of this cocktail available at Guy's Burro Borracho restaurants in Las Vegas and Laughlin NV, and Downtown Flavortown in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee.\n\nThe Chispa Margarita at Gold Coast Kitchen + Cocktails located at Miami Marriott Biscayne Bay is a spicy twist on the classic margarita features Jose Cuervo infused with jalapeno simple syrup and the zesty citrus flavors of lemon juice and pineapple juice, served garnished with a Tajin spice rim, dehydrated pineapple, and a fresh jalapeno slice.

'Mezcal is a spirit that I love and want to continue exposing more people to, so I decided to incorporate it into a cocktail that would be approachable, highlight seasonal ingredients, and illuminate its uniquely earthy & smoky flavors. This cocktail does all of that, while also adding a spicy kick that only further brightens and compliments the natural flavors,' said Missy Williams.\n\nMushroom Margarita\n\nAt Ghost Donkey in Phoenix, a cocktail made with a blend of huitlacoche infused mezcal, nixta, agave syrup, and lime. 'It's as much about corn as it is about mushrooms in this margarita, which is fun. The huitlacoche infusion lends an earthiness and almost a funkiness, while the Nixta provides an extra touch of sweetness to the smoky essence of the Mezcal. The rim of sal de guzano or worm salt, made from roasting the worms that live off the agave plant and blending them with salt and spices, adds a savory and depth of smokiness in flavor,' said Dustin Fox, Beverage Director at Flagship Restaurant Group.\n\nBacanorita\n\nAt Bacanora in Phoenix, this cocktail is made with Sonoran bacanora, lime, and local agave.

It's as refreshing and beautiful as it looks, but upon first sip, it's even more intriguing; crisp and smooth, Milagro tequila is balanced perfectly with bittersweet limoncello and robust flavors of floral elderflower and Italian herbs,' said Daniel Padberg, Director of Food & Beverage.\n\nEsperanza\n\nAt Skybar at Mondrian Los Angeles, this cocktail is made with Codigo 1530 Blanco, St. Germain, pineapple syrup, fresh lime juice, muddled cucumber & cilantro, and tajin rim. 'Our Esperanza is not your average margarita. We add in the St. Germain for floral notes, and a tropical kick from the pineapple syrup. The fresh lime juice brings the zest, while the muddled cucumber and cilantro add a cool, crisp flavor. The Tajin rim brings a playful burst of spice, making it the perfect margarita with a balance of sweet and tangy,' says Mat Yuriditsky, Skybar Director of Operations.\n\nMatchbox Guavarita\n\nAt Matchbox, this cocktail is made with Hornitos Plata Tequila, guava, triple sec, and house made sour mix. 'Guava is a tropical fruit that tastes like a mixture of pineapple, strawberry, pear and passion fruit, combined with tequila, triple sec and sour mix, this cocktail creates a delicious combination of a south of the border classic with a nod to the tropics,' said Jennifer Jackson, Beverage Manager at Thompson Restaurants.\n\nWatermelon Margarita\n\nAt\nin Washington DC, this cocktail is made with Jose Cuervo Especial, house made margarita mix, watermelon syrup and tequila infused watermelon cubes.

'Mezcal has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially among enthusiasts of artisanal and craft spirits. Its earthy and smoky flavor profile may occasionally deter even the most ardent tequila enthusiasts, which is why, for us, crafting a well-balanced and incredibly approachable mezcal cocktail has been a labor of love. The fresh but subtle sweetness of watermelon couples perfectly with the smokey notes of 400 Conejos. We encourage patrons to venture beyond the ordinary and try a creative twist on a classic cocktail style - you won't be disappointed,' said Marissa Cross: Director of Food & Beverage Outlets, Hilton Pensacola Beach.\n\nCharcoal Margarita\n\nAt Tiepolo Lounge & Terrace at Rome Cavalieri, A Waldorf Astoria Hotel , this cocktail is to be enjoyed during a pleasant winter evening, as it may warm one's senses, featuring a unique flavor profile of activated charcoal powder, that is enhanced by the rich smoky notes of cherry wood.'In the Charcoal Margarita, the use of activated charcoal powder, which is a classic in the world of mixology, strongly recalls the element of fire which is part of this year's 4 elements theme at the Tiepolo Lounge. The Tequila and activated charcoal make the cocktail glass dark. Cointreau carves out its territory with a distinct orange flavor, thanks to the essential oils of sweet and bitter oranges and a secret blend of spices. The first sip presents itself bitter to then immediately give way to a refreshing and sweet note given by the Cointreau and fresh lime juice,' said Angelo Severini, Head Bartender at Tiepolo Lounge & Terrace.\n\nSpicy Margarita Proven\u00e7al\n\nA pomegranate-infused margarita features spicy tequila, Passo\u00e3 Passion Fruit Liqueur, pomegranate juice and lime juice at Le Bilboquet Denver.

'Infusing the refreshing element of watermelon and the playful sweetness of the candy, the heatwave offers an unexpected flavor that tantalizes the taste buds.'\n\nMaison Margarita de Jamaica\n\n\"After more than a decade of Maison Premiere being opened, I wanted to put a margarita on the menu, but I wanted it to be something I felt confident wasn't veering too far away from classic margarita, but still had a nod to the ethos and ecosphere of Maison Premiere. From this, the Margarita de Jamaica was born. The hibiscus is a nod to the botany practices in the Victorian era, which so elegantly pairs with the Empirical Spirits Ayuuk which has beautiful peppery notes of pasilla. I wanted the cocktail to please folks who enjoy spicy margaritas, but something that was still smooth and not overly spicy,' said William Elliott, Bar Director and Managing Partner of Maison Premiere in Brooklyn, New York.\n\nTi Amo\n\nAt Mel's in New York City, they infuse Blanco tequila with Sungold tomatoes and pair this with fresh passionfruit, peach liqueur and Ramazzotti Rosato aperitivo, which has notes of hibiscus and stone fruit. The habanero brine brings some heat reminiscent of a spicy margarita.\n\nSpicy Avocado Margarita\n\nAt Romeo's in New York City, Co-Owner and Beverage Director Evan Hawkins (previously of Mother's Ruin, Goodnight Sonny, and Broken Shaker NYC) put a creamy, spicy spin on the classic margarita with his Spicy Avocado Margarita. This bright green creative riff features Blanco Tequila, avocado cordial, fresh lime juice and a spicy tincture made in-house. Evan Hawkins says: 'The goal for the drinks at Romeo's was always about color, texture, and temperature. With that in mind, I've always wanted to do an Avocado Margarita because if we could pull it off with those three ideals, then it could be a great drink. Something fun, different, and visually pleasing to look at and photograph. Keeping the color that nice green was the first step, which is why we use spirulina and light agave as opposed to rich brown to help preserve that rich greenness. We also fortify it with citrus, which keeps it from turning brown. It creates this delicate citrus and creamy sweet taste to the cordial. The creamy texture was what I wanted most as I felt that it would be such a great asset in a margarita, specifically because it can cut right through the citrus flavor of the cocktail to create a nice delicious balance. We add a spicy tincture we make in-house to give it a little kick. We serve it over a big rock so it doesn't over-dilute and on the rim, we dip the glass in Chamoy (Mexican sauce made from savory spices and pickled fruit). Then, we dip that in our house-made spicy salt, which uses several spices including salt, paprika, cayenne, cinnamon, and a touch of sugar. The combo is really nice next to the avocado.'\n\nPink Peppercorn Margarita\n\nAt Malibu Farm Lido (Newport Beach) and Malibu Farm Tiburon, the Pink Peppercorn Margarita is made with Ritual Zero Proof \u2018Tequila,' fresh lime juice, and house-made pink peppercorn agave. The drink is garnished with fresh lime zest and a sprinkle of whole pink peppercorns. \"Here at Malibu Farm, our cocktail program has always highlighted crisp flavors like freshly juiced citrus and seasonal ingredients. We didn't want our non-imbibing guests to be left out of this experience as they too should be able to enjoy a carefully crafted libation, and therefore the Pink Peppercorn \u2018Margarita' was born. Simple, refreshing, and always made with the freshest ingredients, like freshly juiced lime and cracked whole pink peppercorns, the Pink Peppercorn is perfect for anyone who is looking for a cocktail experience without the booze,' said Paige Refino,, General Manager of Malibu Farm Lido and Regional Beverage Director.\n\nThe Breakfast Margarita\n\nAt Holston House in Nashville, this cocktail is made with Blanco Tequila, lime juice, and raspberry preserves. 'I love making cocktails for brunch and trying to find ways to challenge the usuals like a Bloody Mary or Mimosa. I've always enjoyed the Breakfast Martini and it seemed like a great inspiration for making a morning margarita. Tequila deserves an opportunity to shine before noon, so give the Breakfast Marg a shot!' said Ryan Puckett, Area Beverage Director, Holston House.\n\nEl Cielo Millionaire Margarita\n\nAt Bar Collins at Loews Miami Beach Hotel, a luxurious blend of Patron El Cielo, Cointreau and clarified lime cordial poured over a diamond shaped ice cube with gold leaf. Director of Restaurants & Bars, Lucas Scudeler, says, 'The epitome of luxury in a glass, our Millionaire Margarita uses premium Patron El Cielo tequila and house-made clarified lime cordial to create a refreshing and radiantly clear drink, that when poured over our gold leaf infused ice cube, makes for a smooth and indulgent sip.'\n\nSpicy Canary Margarita\n\nAt The Katharine Brasserie & Bar in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, the Spicy Canary Margarita features jalape\u00f1o-infused Ye-Yo Blanco Tequila that's barrel-aged with Bauchant Orange Liqueur for a minimum of 4 weeks. The drink also incorporates demerara for a touch of sweetness and lime, garnished with a spiced rim and dehydrated lime wheel. 'With our barrel-aged program, we decided to barrel-age a margarita vs. your typical bourbon cocktail. The barrel pulls some of those super harsh notes, so you're left with the great jalape\u00f1o flavor in the tequila. My signature spicy rim really sets off that heat, if you are looking for something with a bite on the end. I didn't think the classic spicy margarita could get better, but the barrel did something wonderful with the tequila and it's delightful!' said Justin Rankin, Bar Supervisor.\n\nMargarita Canopy\n\nAt Canopy by Hilton Cancun La Isla, Mexico Hotel, there's a margarita with an unexpected element - a tortilla chip rim. 'The most unique element of this margarita is the salt rim made with salted tortillas, fried and then blended in the perfect cocktail accoutrement,' said Andrei Cocom, Bar supervisor, Canopy by Hilton Cancun La Isla.\n\nMezcalita de Naranjilla\n\nA spicy twist to the margarita, made with mezcal, the Mezcalita at the Silvestre Nosara Hotel & Residences in Nosara, Costa Rica, features the iconic local fruit, Naranjilla (which has a unique flavor often described as a combination of citrus, including pineapple, kiwi and lime) made with mezcal, triple sec, Naranjilla spicy syrup and lime juice. \"The Mezcalita de Naranjilla offers a burst of citrusy flavor found",

        "summary": "Last week, the retail economic indicators were cautiously optimistic, with decent growth predicted for US retail sales in 2024 and bright spots in UK consumer confidence in March. The industry learned through surveys that store employees want enabling technology and cite it as a reason to be loyal to a company, and that stores are better than online for both preventing returns (this isn't a surprise but nice to see some data behind it) and for discovery, especially in fashion. A possibly AI-generated cookbook (and author) gives us a glimpse of just how junky a GenAI future could be. A few retailers had some technology missteps that hampered their ability to sell for a day or two. Some grocery customers are organizing to boycott unless their targeted retailer drops prices by 15%, and self-checkout gets more adjustments in high-theft stores. Let's dive in to the latest in retail and technology.\nRetail Economic Indicators\nNRF published two big numbers in the last week. The first was a take on Easter spending. Spending is expected to reach the second highest level in NRF's consumer intent survey history, surpassed only by last year. This number goes to show how challenging it can be to predict big spending events. Last year came in higher than this year's prediction in part because last year had nine more shopping days leading up to Easter than this year. But regardless of time available, while the same percent of Americans plan to participate in Easter spending this year vs last year, the average spending per person is expected to come in lower \u2013 an average of $177.06 per person vs. $192.01 spend last year.\nNRF also released their prediction for all of 2024 US retail \u2013 they are forecasting an increase of 2.5-3.5%, which would fall around or slightly above the Fed's target inflation range. In 2023, retail sales grew 3.6%. Overall, it's more of the same in terms of a middle-of-the road prediction that probably hides the potential for actual results all over the place, and definitely keeps it open for consumers to continue their unexpected resilience. Or not.\nIn the UK, inflation in February fell to 3.4%, which was welcome news. This was down from January's 4% rate, and the lowest rate in 2.5 years. Food and restaurant drove the decline, with housing and fuel still relatively high. And while UK consumer confidence remained unchanged in March, flat at -21 according to GfK data, there were some positives in some of the survey numbers. Consumer expectations for the general economic situation over the next year rose one point to -23, which is 17 points better than March last year, and the personal finance forecast rose two points to +2, which is 23 points better than March last year and the first positive score since December 2021. Not just in the UK and not just related to consumer confidence, there appears to be some 'blips' between February and March data \u2013 US March inflation data seemed to be a 'blip', but we'll need to see another month to know if that's really true or not.\nRetail Tech & Research Data\nThis week saw a raft of research related to the impact of stores. First up, a survey by eMarketer, which found that physical stores have the most influence on discovery in fashion than any other channel. The numbers weren't maybe as definitive as store operators would want them to be: 'nearly' 40% of consumers say they learn about fashion by visiting a physical store. Brand and Retailer websites came in 2 nd and 3 rd on the list, also with responses in the 30%'s. However, store preference was higher for Gen Z than for other generations.\nA new Scandit survey of 2,000 store associates across 9 retail verticals found that store employees want more technology available to them. 40% said their employer doesn't invest in their technology needs and 20% say they feel like it's 'actively' not a priority. 41% say easy-to-use technology is a top-3 driver of their loyalty, behind work/life balance and competitive pay. It's the 'actively' not a priority that stings, but I can say I've seen it too \u2013 just a complete lack of belief that technology in store employees' hands drives any kind of value, or serves only as a distraction.\nAnd a new Consumer Returns Survey from the International Consortium of Shopping Centers (ICSC) found that shoppers return brick & mortar-purchased items at a far lower rate than online transactions. They found that online returns average 15.2%, which is three times the return rate for in-store purchases, at 5%. That was across industries. For apparel in particular, online returns hit 22% on average, while stores hit 6.2%. And 87% of consumers surveyed who report overbuying apparel online said they do so in order to try it on at home. For the basket of Aptos APT customers that I track, I can see very similar averages.\nAI & Retail\nI'm a big fan of The Future Normal, a newsletter run by Henry Coutinho-Mason, and last week he had a monster issue that covered both sides of the coin around the impact of AI. It could make the world worse, but it could also make it better. But there were two examples that he used that I thought were worth calling out. One, the example of IKEA retraining its 8500 customer service operators to be remote design consultants after replacing their old job with a chatbot. Through this upskilling, IKEA generated EU1.3 billion in sales in 2022. You can't cut your way to growth. But you can invest to get there.\nThe second example was Kernel, a new effort by Chipotle founder Steve Ellis. Kernel is a new 'robot-powered, partially automated restaurant concept.' Each outlet requires only three workers, but Ellis pointed out that it was also an opportunity to take a 'McJob' and turn it into $27/hour with a paid vacation. An interesting way to look at how to invest those automation savings.\nOn the downside of AI, I could see this one coming a mile away, but it's nice to have some data to back it up. It's true that retailers have a lot of data. But AI's hunger for data far, far outstrips retailers' ability to supply it, not least because no matter how hard they try a lot of it is locked into siloes or not in any way prepared to be training data for an AI model. Salesforce CRM and the Retail AI Council surveyed 1400 retailers and found that nearly half of respondents say they're struggling to make their data accessible. Only 42% are connecting their various data siloes. Only 17% say they have a complete, single view of their customers. And 49% say they are still in the preliminary stages of building or even considering the creation of a complete customer profile.\nIt gets even worse \u2013 half of respondents say they lack the ability to fully comply with data security standards and data privacy regulations, but the adoption marches on regardless \u2013 36% say they think their employees are already using GenAI today and that the number will grow to 45% by the end of 2025. The focus area? Personalization, with 93% saying they are using GenAI for some sort of personalization, like with email copy or product recommendations.\nAnd if you want a taste of at least one possible future for AI, it's already here, with this great story about a gift that turned into a dizzying journey into nonsensical cookbook and its possibly AI-generated author. Lawmakers want to do more to put a stop to this kind of fakery, and keep trying to find ways to make the marketplace \u2013 in this case Amazon AMZN \u2013 responsible. But where I keep getting hung up is around the money.\nMarketplaces say 'hey, look, buyer beware. I can't be responsible for the millions of sellers and listings.' But they sure have found a way to monetize those millions of sellers and listings. And that's where I feel like they should be vulnerable. To put it in real life terms, it may be true that a flea market, for example, can't be held responsible for illegal activity that happens on its property during its operating hours. But shouldn't they be held at least partly responsible if they're letting in (and making money off of) sellers that are selling counterfeit goods? I'm not a lawyer, but that's what I spend my time thinking about when I hear these kinds of stories \u2013 and I think we'll hear more and more of these in the future.\nRetail Winners and Losers\nIt was one thing to hear about Southwest's extraordinary meltdown over the holidays when their scheduling software basically went belly up after years of underinvestment. It's another thing to hear about it from retailers who are actually actively investing in tech. First McDonalds with its app going down across multiple continents, then Sainsbury having to cancel nearly a whole day's worth of orders placed for home delivery. It just goes to show that creating a seamless experience is still not so easy, and requires a lot of coordination across a lot of different technologies and touch points.\nMeantime, Loblaws shoppers have threatened to boycott in response to what they cite as high prices. It all started last November on \u2013 where else? \u2013 Reddit, with a subgroup called 'Loblaws is out of control'. The group started out by venting, and then by organizing. More than 25,000 members post photos of items they claim are outrageously priced, and they're targeting the whole set of Loblaws banners including Shoppers Drug Mart and T&T Supermarket for a boycott in May if the company doesn't cut prices across the board by 15%, among other demands.\nOn one level, I feel like this isn't about Loblaws in particular, just that these shoppers got together first. And of all the industries, it has been grocers stuck the most between shoppers feeling the pinch and CPG brands who have definitely raised prices beyond inflation \u2013 as Carrefour went so far as to ban selling Pepsi in January, citing basically 'outrageous prices'. Will we see more consumer efforts like this? My bet is yes. Social media helps people who would normally never connect find each other, and it also naturally (or through 'The Algorithm') puts the more 'engaging' content (read: rage inducing) front and center. So yes, we'll see more of this.\nIn the great Self-Checkout (SCO) debate, Five Below FIVE and Dollar General DG both are changing up SCO to either reduce its availability, lower the limit on the number of items you can take through SCO, and/or provide more staff assistance in SCO lanes. Target TGT made changes too, among many others on the list trying to shore up loss prevention in their highest-theft stores.\nAnd finally, several more examples of retailers who are no longer just in retail. Walmart WMT is going to sell its AI-based logistics solution (called 'Route Optimization') to third party businesses of all sizes, all through its Walmart Commerce Technologies subsidiary. Marks & Spencer is reportedly nearing a deal with HSBC HBA, the provider of M&S's banking services, to provide a 'superapp' that will combine banking, payment, and the retailer's loyalty program all in one.\nShein is going to sell its small batch manufacturing model to anyone who wants to use the capacity. They're billing it as 'supply chain as a service' but I feel like that's a bit misleading \u2013 it's the quick, small batch capacity that is valuable here, not necessarily how it gets from China to anywhere else. And lest you forget about Amazon, the ultimate in 'not really a retailer', it announced that its Zoox subsidiary \u2013 the company's autonomous vehicle subsidiary \u2013 is expanding the scope of its pilots in Foster City, CA and Las Vegas, NV. The pilots are for robotaxis. At the moment.\nThe Bottom Line\nIt's gratifying to see something that you believe is true get supported by actual research, even if you have to be careful to make sure you understand what the research really means (and be careful of my own confirmation bias). But the benefits and ROI for eCommerce are easy to see, and in this muddled omnichannel world, I think it's harder to see the value contribution of stores \u2013 and the squeaky wheel is the one that gets the oil, more often than not.\nIt's not gratifying to see retailers already starting to run into a data wall when it comes to their aspirations for GenAI, but it's not surprising either. I think this will be a theme through all of 2024 \u2013 'that proof of concept went great but that's as far as we can go until we do a lot of work on making our data more organized and accessible.' But \u2013 as the strange cookbook experience shows \u2013 we are still in the early days of what GenAI can do, both all the good and all the bad. And, as McDonalds and Sainsbury show, even the more basic tech journeys are not easy. However, consumers don't care. They have their expectations, and we have to meet them.",

        "summary": "TRUCKEE, Calif. \u2014 Keep the shovels handy: a powerful blizzard in the Sierra Nevada mountains was expected to wane Sunday, but more heavy snow is on the way.\nThe National Weather Service said conditions would improve as winds weakened Sunday, but precipitation would quickly return, with heavy snow in some areas and rainfall in others. That wasn't much of a break after a multiday storm that one meteorologist called 'as bad as it gets' closed a key east-west freeway in northern California, shut down ski resorts and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.\nBy Sunday morning, Pacific Gas & Electric had restored power to all but about 7,000 California customers, while NV Energy had reduced its number to roughly 1,000 homes and businesses. And some ski areas were planning to reopen, albeit with delayed start times and limited operations.\n'We aren't outta the woods just yet,' officials at Sierra at Tahoe posted on the resort's website.\nPalisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of Lake Tahoe and site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, closed all chairlifts Saturday because of snow, wind and low visibility. It planned to reopen late Sunday morning after getting an estimated 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow on the upper mountain as of Saturday night.\n'We will be digging out for the foreseeable future,' officials said on the resort's blog.\nMore than 10 feet (three meters) of snow was expected at higher elevations, National Weather Service meteorologist William Churchill said Saturday, creating a 'life-threatening concern' for residents near Lake Tahoe and blocking travel on the east-west freeway. He called the storm an 'extreme blizzard' for the Sierra Nevada but said he didn't expect records to be broken.\n'It's certainly just about as bad as it gets in terms of the snow totals and the winds,' Churchill said. 'It doesn't get much worse than that.'\nThe storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covered a 300-mile (480-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring an additional 1 to 2 feet of snow in the region between Monday and Wednesday next week, according to the National Weather Service office in Sacramento.\nNear Lake Tahoe, the Alibi Ale Works brewpub and restaurant was one of the few businesses open on Saturday. Bartender Thomas Petkanas ssaid about 3 feet (1 meter) of snow had fallen by midday, and patrons were shaking off snow as they arrived.\n'It's snowing pretty hard out there, really windy, and power is out to about half the town,' Petkanas said by telephone.\nCalifornia authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of 'spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.' There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.\nIn Truckee, California, veteran snow-plow driver Kyle Frankland said several parts of his rig broke as he cleared wet snow underneath piles of powder.\n'I've been in Truckee 44 years. This is a pretty good storm,' Frankland said. 'It's not record-breaking by any means, but it's a good storm.'\nRitter reported from Las Vegas. Associated Press reporters Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada; Janie Har in San Francisco; Julie Walker in New York; and Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed.",

        "summary": "TRUCKEE, Calif. \u2014 A powerful blizzard that closed highways and ski resorts had mostly moved through the Sierra Nevada by early Monday but forecasters warned that more snow was on the way for Northern California mountains.\nSections of Interstate 80 to the west and north of Lake Tahoe were still shut down late Sunday, with no estimate for reopening, the California Highway Patrol said.\nThe CHP office in South Lake Tahoe warned motorists that tire chains for improved traction are required on routes through the mountains, where more than 7 feet (2.1 meters) of snow fell over the weekend.\nBlizzard warnings had mostly expired but scattered thunderstorms were likely and another 2 feet (60 centimeters) of snow was possible at higher elevations, the National Weather Service office in Sacramento said.\n'Mountain travel is HIGHLY discouraged!' the office warned.\nThe multiday storm caused traffic backups and closures on I-80 and many other roadways, shut down ski resorts for two days, and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.\nBy Sunday night, Pacific Gas & Electric had restored electricity to all but about 4,400 Northern California customers, while NV Energy had reduced its outages to roughly 1,000 homes and businesses across the state line in Nevada.\nPalisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of the lake, was among several ski mountains that closed most or all chairlifts for a second straight day Sunday because of snow, wind and low visibility. Palisades reported a three-day snow total of 6 feet (1.8 meters), with more falling.\n'We will be digging out for the foreseeable future,' officials said on the resort's blog.\nKevin Dupui, who lives in Truckee, just northwest of Lake Tahoe, said his snow blower broke, but it doesn't really matter because there's nowhere to put all the snow anyway. 'We just move it around,' he said Sunday.\nDupui said residents and tourists seem to be mostly heeding warnings to stay home. 'The roads haven't been that safe, so we don't really want people driving around,' he said.\nAnother Truckee resident, Jenelle Potvin, said at first some cynical locals thought 'there was a little too much hype' made about the approaching storm. But then the unrelenting snow began Friday night.\n'It was definitely a blizzard. And we woke up to a lot of snow yesterday and it never let up,' Potvin said Sunday. Her neighbors were snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in the streets.\nIn the eastern Sierra, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area was closed Sunday as winds of up to 70 mph (113 kph) made it too difficult for ski patrol to complete avalanche mitigation, the resort said. More than 3 feet (nearly 1 meter) of snow fell over three days, and more was on the way.\nWeather service meteorologist William Churchill on Saturday called the storm an 'extreme blizzard' for the Sierra Nevada but said he didn't expect records to be broken.\nThe storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A widespread blizzard warning through Sunday morning covered a 300-mile (480-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring additional rain and snow between Monday and Wednesday, forecasters said.\nCalifornia authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of 'spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.' There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.\nRudy Islas spent about 40 minutes shoveling his car out before heading to work at a coffee shop in Truckee on Sunday morning. Neither he nor his customers were fazed by the snow, he said.\n'To be honest, if you're a local, it's not a big deal,' he said. 'I think a lot of people are used to the snow and they prepare for it.'\nWeber reported from Los Angeles. Associated Press reporters Ken Ritter in Las Vegas; Scott Sonner in Reno, Nevada; Janie Har in San Francisco; Julie Walker in New York; and Holly Ramer in Concord, New Hampshire, contributed.",

        "summary": "This could be the most-watched Super Bowl on record, thanks in part to Taylor Swift. But that's not the only milestone for the NFL showdown.\nAllegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will be powered by 100% renewable energy \u2014 a first in Super Bowl history.\nThe electricity is supplied by a sprawling solar farm of 621,000 panels and battery storage in the Nevada desert that's owned by the utility NV Energy and was developed by EDF Renewables.\nThe Raiders \nhave a 25-year deal\n with NV Energy to buy power from the renewable energy project for Allegiant Stadium and its administrative and practice facilities. The project also has enough capacity to serve other NV Energy customers in the state.\nThe stadium will use about 28 megawatt hours of power during the Super Bowl, or the equivalent of about 46,000 homes, according to NZero, the company tracking the stadium's greenhouse gas emissions.\n'If they can do it, hopefully it inspires people with homes or small businesses and other corporations to move in this direction,' Adam Kramer, CEO of NZero, told Business Insider. 'There's not a bigger stage in the United States than the Super Bowl, and the fact that sustainability is one of the storylines says everything.'\u00a0\nKramer said it's notable that Allegiant Stadium will use renewable energy to reduce its own emissions on-site, rather than buy carbon offsets that claim to cut pollution elsewhere.\u00a0\nA spokesperson for NV Energy said in an email that the deal with Allegiant Stadium is part of a larger strategy to produce 50% of its energy from renewable sources by 2030, which is required under state law.\u00a0\nThe Las Vegas Raiders' sustainability efforts also go beyond renewable energy, Kramer said, noting that Allegiant Stadium has programs to keep waste out of landfills and was built with energy- and water-efficient systems.\u00a0\nThe stadium said that about \n12,000 pounds of food waste\n is sent to a livestock farm in Las Vegas after each event, while grass clippings and cigarettes are composted or converted into energy. In July, the stadium became LEED Gold Certified. Seven other stadiums in the US have that certification, which is the second-highest ranking by the trade group the US Green Building Council.\nSo when the Raiders and San Francisco 49s kick off on Sunday, it won't just be the turf that's green.",

        "summary": "EL SEGUNDO, Calif., March 11, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- \n\u00a0\nJM Bullion, Inc.\n (JMB)\n, a leading e-commerce retailer of precious metals and wholly-owned subsidiary of \nA-Mark Precious Metals, Inc.\n(NASDAQ: AMRK) (A-Mark)\n, has acquired the gold.com domain. With this acquisition, JMB now owns both gold.com and silver.com, two of the most recognizable domains in the precious metals industry.\n'The acquisition of the gold.com domain represents a significant investment in our direct-to-consumer growth strategy,' said JMB CEO Robert Pacelli. 'The gold.com domain carries broad global appeal and is an extremely versatile asset that will be incorporated into our long term strategy.

        "summary": "When you buy through our links, Business Insider may earn an affiliate commission. Learn more\n\nThe tribe has spoken. The new season of Survivor starts tonight, and there are a couple of different ways that you can tune in. Below, we'll teach you where to watch Survivor live and on-demand throughout the new season.\n\nThe long-running survival competition reality series, hosted by Jeff Probst, returns for its 46th season on CBS. Episodes air Wednesday nights, and each week promises a new set of heart-pounding adventures for the 18 contestants castaway on the islands of Fiji. In a historic move, the first two episodes will be two hours long, and the rest of the season's episodes will clock in at 90 minutes each. We'll give you all of the necessary details on the new season, including how to watch it live.\n\nWhere to watch Survivor in the USA\n\nSurvivor airs on CBS at 8 p.m. ET in the USA. If you don't have access to basic cable, you can live stream the episodes through Paramount Plus. The live-streaming option comes with the Paramount Plus with Showtime subscription tier, which goes for $11.99 per month. All Paramount Plus subscriptions, including Paramount Plus Essential, will have access to new episodes the day after they premiere. The streaming service also includes the entire back-catalog of all 45 past Survivor seasons.\n\nIf you're looking for more options for live TV that includes CBS, you can try out one of the cable alternative packages like Fubo. Fubo plans begin at $79.99 per month (with an introductory month at $20 off) and include a one-week free trial. Hulu + Live TV also includes CBS in its packages. Subscriptions for Hulu + Live TV start at $76.99 per month.\n\nHulu + Live TV Hulu + Live TV includes over 90 channels, along with Hulu's on-demand library and access to Disney Plus and ESPN+. Adding live TV drives up the price significantly, but it's a rolling one-month contract that you're free to cancel at any time. As live TV cord-cutting cable replacement services go, though, this is one of the best.

Global TV also features episodes from Season 45, which you can access by logging in through your cable provider.\n\nHow to watch Survivor internationally\n\nIf you're unable to access live streams of Survivor in your region right now, you can use a VPN (virtual private network) to change the country that your electronic device is currently associated with in order to access relevant websites and apps that way. VPNs also help boost your online security and privacy. Using this method, you should be able to use your existing live TV package from overseas and watch Survivor. You need a US payment form to sign up for these packages, so this strategy is best for people from the US who are just out of the country and want to keep up with their regular programming.\n\nWe recommend ExpressVPN, an easy-to-use virtual private network with a 30-day money-back guarantee. You can read more about it in our ExpressVPN review and learn how to use it below.\n\nExpressVPN Plan With its consistent performance, reliable security, and expansive global streaming features, ExpressVPN is the best VPN out there, excelling in every spec and offering many advanced features that makes it exceptional.

        "excerpt": "Donald Trump appeared to blame Israel for antisemitism, saying Israel made a \"big mistake\" in its response to Hamas' attack on Oct. 7 and is \"losing a lot of support.\"",
        "summary": "Former President Donald Trump appeared to blame Israel for antisemitism, saying Israel made a \"big mistake\" in its response to Hamas' attack on Oct. 7 and is \"losing a lot of support\" from around the world. But he also noted that he would have responded \"very much the same\" as Israel did against such an attack. Sitting down at Mar-a-Lago over the weekend with Israeli outlet Israel Hayom, which is owned by the late major Republican megadonor and casino mogul Sheldon Adelson's family, Trump said \"that's because you fought back,\" when he was asked how he would deal with a wave of antisemitism in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war. \"Well, that's because you fought back. And I think Israel made a very big mistake,\" Trump reportedly said in a part of the interview that was released only in text, calling attention to the harrowing images from the war released by the Israeli government. \"I wanted to call [Israel] and say don't do it. These photos and shots. I mean, moving shots of bombs being dropped into buildings in Gaza,\" Trump reportedly continued. \"And I said, Oh, that's a terrible portrait. It's a very bad picture for the world. The world is seeing this ... every night, I would watch buildings pour down on people. It would say it was given by the Defense Ministry, and said whoever's providing that, that's a bad image.\" Former President Donald Trump is introduced at the Republican Jewish Coalition's Annual Leadership Summit in Las Vegas, NV, Oct. 28, 2023.When Israel Hayom followed up, claiming terrorists are hiding in buildings, Trump reportedly responded: \"Go and do what you have to do. But you don't do that.\" \"And I think that's one of the reasons that there has been a lot of kickback. If people didn't see that, every single night I've watched every single one of those. And I think Israel wanted to show that it's tough, but sometimes you shouldn't be doing that,\" the former president continued. Hamas carried out an unprecedented incursion from Gaza into southern Israel by air, land and sea on Oct. 7, 2023, killing more than 1,200 people and taking 253 others hostage, according to Israeli authorities. More than 31,400 Palestinians have been killed and more than 72,000 others have been injured in Gaza since Oct. 7, amid Israel's ongoing ground operations and aerial bombardment of the strip, according to the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry. The Israel Defense Forces has said it is only targeting Hamas and other militants in Gaza and alleges that Hamas deliberately shelters behind civilians, which the group denies. In another part of the interview, released as a part of a 10-minute edited video, Trump warned Israel that it's \"losing a lot of support\" from the world and urged it to end the war. \"I will say Israel has to be very careful because you're losing a lot of the world. You're losing a lot of support,\" Trump said, going beyond his usual line of calling for peace. \"But you have to finish up. You have to get the job done. And you have to get on to peace. You have to get on to a normal life for Israel and for everybody else.\" When asked how he would react to an attack like that of Hamas on Oct. 7, Trump said he would \"act very much the same as you did,\" saying \"you would have to be crazy not to.\" Throughout the Israel Hayom interview, Trump blamed President Joe Biden, saying, in part: \"But it was an attack that I blame on Biden because they have no respect for him.\" Later in the interview, Trump said he believed Israel needs to improve in \"public relations,\" claiming that pro-Israel forces were much stronger in the United States in the past. On the campaign trail, Trump has branded himself as the most pro-Israel U.S. president in history, often touting his role in the first term moving the U.S. Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and claiming he'd stand with Israel \"all the way 100% without hesitation\" after the Hamas attack last year. Former President Donald Trump speaks during the Republican Jewish Coalition (RJC) Annual Leadership Meeting in Las Vegas, NV, Oct. 28, 2023. Rhonda Churchill/Bloomberg via Getty Images Trump himself has not refrained from making disparaging comments about the war, telling a group of Jewish Republicans in Las Vegas last year: \"The conflict between Israel and Hamas is not a conflict between two equal sides. This is a fight between civilization and savagery. Between decency and depravity and between good and evil.\" \"There can be no sympathy, no excuses and no escape for these monsters and we will do what has to be done,\" Trump said at the Republican Jewish Coalition conference in Las Vegas. After he recently faced backlash for saying Jewish Democrats \"hate Israel\" and \"should be ashamed of themselves,\" Trump again echoed a similar sentiment over the weekend, claiming Jewish Americans should not vote for Democrats. \"I think that means you should never vote for them. How could a Jewish person vote for Kamala Harris?\" Trump said, when asked about Vice President Kamala Harris' stepdaughter Ella Emhoff reportedly helping raise money for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA), the main U.N. humanitarian organization operating in Gaza and some of whose staff have been accused by Israel of participating in the Oct. 7 attack. \"You might have Kamala Harris if this doesn't work out, you have her right now. If something happened to [Biden], you have her,\" Trump said.",

        "summary": "TRUCKEE, Calif. -- \nKeep the shovels handy: a powerful blizzard in the Sierra Nevada mountains was expected to wane Sunday, but more heavy snow is on the way.\nThe National Weather Service said conditions would improve as winds weakened Sunday, but precipitation would quickly return, with heavy snow in some areas and rainfall in others.\n'We still have some showers ongoing especially up in the Sierra, and that will kind of continue throughout this afternoon, and then finally taper off overnight tonight,' said Justin Collins, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Reno. 'That's kind of the wrap up of the storm, if you will, and we're going to have a few more waves come through early this week.\"\nThat wasn't much of a break after a multiday storm that one meteorologist called 'as bad as it gets' closed a key east-west freeway in northern California, shut down ski resorts and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.\nBy Sunday morning, Pacific Gas & Electric had restored power to all but about 7,000 California customers, while NV Energy had reduced its number to roughly 1,000 homes and businesses. And some ski areas were planning to reopen, albeit with delayed start times and limited operations.\n'We aren't outta the woods just yet,' officials at Sierra at Tahoe posted on the resort's website.\nPalisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of Lake Tahoe and site of the 1960 Winter Olympics, closed all chairlifts Saturday because of snow, wind and low visibility. It planned to reopen late Sunday morning after getting an estimated 5 feet (1.5 meters) of snow on the upper mountain as of Saturday night.\n'We will be digging out for the foreseeable future,' officials said on the resort's blog.\nCollins, the meteorologist, said some ski areas reported getting nearly 7 feet (2 meters) of snow. More than 10 feet (three meters) of snow was expected at higher elevations, National Weather Service meteorologist William Churchill said Saturday, creating a 'life-threatening concern' for residents near Lake Tahoe and blocking travel on the east-west freeway. He called the storm an 'extreme blizzard' for the Sierra Nevada but said he didn't expect records to be broken.\n'It's certainly just about as bad as it gets in terms of the snow totals and the winds,' Churchill said. 'It doesn't get much worse than that.'\nThe storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A blizzard warning through Sunday morning covered a 300-mile (480-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring an additional 1 to 2 feet of snow in the region between Monday and Wednesday next week, according to the National Weather Service office in Sacramento.\nNear Lake Tahoe, the Alibi Ale Works brewpub and restaurant was one of the few businesses open on Saturday. Bartender Thomas Petkanas ssaid about 3 feet (1 meter) of snow had fallen by midday, and patrons were shaking off snow as they arrived.\n'It's snowing pretty hard out there, really windy, and power is out to about half the town,' Petkanas said by telephone. \nCalifornia authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of 'spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.' There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.\nIn Truckee, California, veteran snow-plow driver Kyle Frankland said several parts of his rig broke as he cleared wet snow underneath piles of powder.\n'I've been in Truckee 44 years. This is a pretty good storm,' Frankland said. 'It's not record-breaking by any means, but it's a good storm.'\n___\nRitter reported from Las Vegas.

        "summary": "TRUCKEE, Calif. -- \nA powerful blizzard that closed highways and ski resorts had mostly moved through the Sierra Nevada by early Monday but forecasters warned that more snow was on the way for Northern California mountains. \nSections of Interstate 80 to the west and north of Lake Tahoe were still shut down late Sunday, with no estimate for reopening, the California Highway Patrol said.\nThe CHP office in South Lake Tahoe warned motorists that tire chains for improved traction are required on routes through the mountains, where more than 7 feet (2.1 meters) of snow fell over the weekend. \nBlizzard warnings had mostly expired but scattered thunderstorms were likely and another 2 feet (60 centimeters) of snow was possible at higher elevations, the National Weather Service office in Sacramento said. \n'Mountain travel is HIGHLY discouraged!' the office warned.\nThe multiday storm caused traffic backups and closures on I-80 and many other roadways, shut down ski resorts for two days, and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.\nBy Sunday night, Pacific Gas & Electric had restored electricity to all but about 4,400 Northern California customers, while NV Energy had reduced its outages to roughly 1,000 homes and businesses across the state line in Nevada.\nPalisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of the lake, was among several ski mountains that closed most or all chairlifts for a second straight day Sunday because of snow, wind and low visibility. Palisades reported a three-day snow total of 6 feet (1.8 meters), with more falling.\n'We will be digging out for the foreseeable future,' officials said on the resort's blog.\nKevin Dupui, who lives in Truckee, just northwest of Lake Tahoe, said his snow blower broke, but it doesn't really matter because there's nowhere to put all the snow anyway. 'We just move it around,' he said Sunday.\nDupui said residents and tourists seem to be mostly heeding warnings to stay home. 'The roads haven't been that safe, so we don't really want people driving around,' he said.\nAnother Truckee resident, Jenelle Potvin, said at first some cynical locals thought 'there was a little too much hype' made about the approaching storm. But then the unrelenting snow began Friday night.\n'It was definitely a blizzard. And we woke up to a lot of snow yesterday and it never let up,' Potvin said Sunday. Her neighbors were snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in the streets. \nIn the eastern Sierra, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area was closed Sunday as winds of up to 70 mph (113 kph) made it too difficult for ski patrol to complete avalanche mitigation, the resort said. More than 3 feet (nearly 1 meter) of snow fell over three days, and more was on the way.\nWeather service meteorologist William Churchill on Saturday called the storm an 'extreme blizzard' for the Sierra Nevada but said he didn't expect records to be broken.\nThe storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A widespread blizzard warning through Sunday morning covered a 300-mile (480-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring additional rain and snow between Monday and Wednesday, forecasters said.\nCalifornia authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of 'spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.' There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.\nRudy Islas spent about 40 minutes shoveling his car out before heading to work at a coffee shop in Truckee on Sunday morning. Neither he nor his customers were fazed by the snow, he said.\n'To be honest, if you're a local, it's not a big deal,' he said. 'I think a lot of people are used to the snow and they prepare for it.'\n___\nWeber reported from Los Angeles.

        "summary": "NASA selected 45 student essays as semifinalists of its \n2024 Power to Explore Challenge\n, a national competition for K-12 students featuring the enabling power of radioisotopes. Contestants were challenged to explore how NASA has powered some of its most famous science missions and to dream up how their personal 'superpower' would energize their success on their own radioisotope-powered science mission. The competition asked students to learn about \nRadioisotope Power Systems\n (RPS), 'nuclear batteries' that NASA uses to explore the harshest, darkest, and dustiest parts of our solar system. RPS have enabled many spacecraft to conduct otherwise impossible missions in total darkness.\n\n\nIn 250 words or less, students wrote about a mission of their own that would use these space power systems and described their own power to achieve their mission goals. The challenges of space exploration without solar power are especially relevant ahead of the United States' upcoming April 8 total solar eclipse, which will offer a momentary glimpse into what life would be like without sunlight.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Power to Explore Challenge offered students the opportunity to learn more about these reliable power systems, celebrate their own strengths, and interact with NASA's diverse workforce. This year's contest received 1,787 submitted entries from 48 states and Puerto Rico.\n\n\n'It has been so exciting to see how many students across the nation have submitted essays to NASA's Power to Explore Challenge,' said Carl Sandifer, program manager of the Radioisotope Power Systems Program at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Cleveland. 'We have been thrilled to read their creative RPS-powered mission concepts and have been inspired learning about their many \u2018superpowers' that make them the bright future of NASA \u2013 the Artemis Generation.'\n\n\nEntries were split into three categories: grades K-4, 5-8, and 9-12. Every student who submitted an entry received a digital certificate, and over 4,094 participants who signed up received an invitation to the Power Up virtual event. With NASA's Associate Administrator for the  Mission Directorate Nicola Fox, NASA's Radioisotope Power Systems Program Manager Carl Sandifer, and Kim Rink of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in\n\n\nSouthern California, students learned about what powers the NASA workforce to dream big and work together to explore.\n\n\nFifteen national semifinalists in each grade category (45 semifinalists total) have been selected. These participants also will receive a NASA RPS prize pack. Finalists for this challenge will be announced on April 8 in celebration of the total solar eclipse.\n \n\n\nMaryam Asif, Sarasota, FL\n\n\nThashvi Balaji, Riverview, FL\n\n\nYavuz Bastug, Peckville, PA\n\n\nClaire Bennett, La Grange, NC\n\n\nAda Brolan, Somerville, MA\n\n\nJoseph Brown, Huntsville, AL\n\n\nAshwin Cohen, Washington, D.C.\n\n\nAdara George, Lithia, FL\n\n\nKaterine Leon, Long Beach, CA\n\n\nRainie Lin, Lexington, KY\n\n\nConnor Personette, Lakeland, FL\n\n\nYash Rajan, Issaquah, WA\n\n\nCamila Rymzo, Belmont, MA\n\n\nArslan Soner, Columbia, SC\n\n\nZachary Tolchin, Guilford, CT\n\n\n \n\n\nNithilam Arivuchelvan, Short Hills, NJ\n\n\nNandini Bandyopadhyay, Short Hills, NJ\n\n\nCooper Basi, Rocklin, CA\n\n\nJoshua Cheng, Rockville, MD\n\n\nKaitlyn Chu, Mercer Island, WA\n\n\nMayson Howell, Troy, MO\n\n\nDhiraj Javvadi, Louisville, KY\n\n\nAadya Karthik, Redmond, WA\n\n\nSubham Maiti, Bloomington, MN\n\n\nMeadow McCarthy, Corvallis, OR\n\n\nElianna Muthersbaugh, Bluffton, SC\n\n\nArcher Prentice, Koloa, HI\n\n\nAndrew Tavares, Bridgewater, MA\n\n\nSara Wang, Henderson, NV\n\n\nAnna Yang, Austin, TX\n\n\n \n\n\nSabrina Affany, Fresno, CA\n\n\nAlejandro Aguirre, Mission Viejo, CA\n\n\nSai Meghana Chakka, Charlotte, NC\n\n\nKhushi Jain, San Jose, CA\n\n\nAiden Johnson, Virginia Beach, VA\n\n\nRobert Kreidler, Cincinnati, OH\n\n\nZoie Lawson, Tigard, OR\n\n\nThomas Liu, Ridgewood, NJ\n\n\nMadeline Male, Fairway, KS\n\n\nDang Khoi Pham, Westminster, CA\n\n\nSofia Anna Reed-Gomes, Coral Gables, FL\n\n\nAva Schmidt, Leavenworth, WA\n\n\nMadden Smith, Loveland, OH\n\n\nKailey Thomas, Las Vegas, NV\n\n\nWarren Volles, Lyme, CT\n\n\n \nThe challenge is funded by the Radioisotope Power Systems Program Office in NASA's  Mission Directorate and administered by Future Engineers under the NASA Open Innovation Services 2 contract.

        "excerpt": "Portland is a bid-stealer. Who do they bump off the bubble?",
        "summary": "It didn't take long for March to inflict its madness on women's college basketball.\nOn Tuesday afternoon, Portland stunned Gonzaga in the West Coast Conference tournament final in Las Vegas, Nevada. The Pilots snapped the Bulldogs' 24-game win streak to win 67-66 to win the tournament and earn the WCC's automatic bid to the NCAA tournament.\nIt was just the third loss of the season for Gonzaga, which tied its season-worst 3-point shooting mark with 25%. The Zags also shot just 37.1% from the floor, their second-worst mark of the season. Portland's defense was a big reason why it won.\nThe Pilots went ahead for good on this 3-pointer from Emme Shearer with 1:38 to play.\nEMME SHEARER 3\u00ef\u00b8\u008f\u00e2\u0083\u00a3\u00f0\u009f\u008e\u00af\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00b0: https://t.co/6jK9kE9rpU\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u008a: https://t.co/M5kVRBpJCK\u00f0\u009f\u0093\u00bb: https://t.co/MJSzbsyJCj pic.twitter.com/UQJnm1Uwd7\nThe result is one that will have ripple effects across women's college basketball and could impact the NCAA tournament bracket in a few ways. Let's break it down.\n\nMarch 12, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Portland Pilots players celebrate against the Gonzaga Bulldogs after the game in the finals of the WCC Basketball Championship at Orleans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nYou might be asking, what is a bid-stealer?\nIt's best defined as a team from typically a one-bid, mid-major league that wins its conference tournament when it wasn't supposed to, meaning that the team that was projected to win that league \u2014 but didn't \u2014 has a resume good enough for an at-large bid, turning that league into a two-bid one, which will bump a team off the bubble.\nAnd that's exactly what we have here. Gonzaga was going to make the NCAA tournament regardless of what happened in the WCC title game. The Zags were 12th in NET on Tuesday and had 30 wins, including over the likes of Stanford, South Dakota State, Alabama, and two over Portland in the regular season.\nBut Portland needed to win the WCC tournament to punch a ticket into the Big Dance. And so, the WCC becomes a two-bid league. Gonzaga will surely get an at-large bid, and Portland takes the automatic qualifier spot.\nBid-stealers are bad news for teams on the bubble. Think about those Power 5 teams with about 20 wins that finished middle-of-the-pack in their league. For example, ESPN's Charlie Creme believes that Portland's win means that Mississippi State will end up on the wrong side of bubble and out of the field of 68.\nQuite an amazing game and result. Portland is a bid stealer. Mississippi State falls out. https://t.co/T9blcw8cPQ\n\u2014 Charlie Creme (@CharlieCreme) March 12, 2024\n\n\n\nMarch 12, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Gonzaga Bulldogs guard Kayleigh Truong (11) shoots the basketball against the Portland Pilots during the second half in the finals of the WCC Basketball Championship at Orleans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nWhen the NCAA tournament selection committee did its last top 16 seed list reveal on Feb. 29, it had Gonzaga penciled in as the 15th overall seed, which meant the Bulldogs were projected to host games in Spokane, Washington during the tournament's first weekend.\nHad Gonzaga's winning streak continued, they were likely a lock to host games as a top 16 seed. But its easy to wonder if the committee will look at the loss to Portland as a reason to knock the Zags off the 4-line.\nGonzaga has a great resume \u2014 in addition to its NET and pile of wins, it's also seventh in HerHoopStats rating, and the Bulldogs are 20-0 against teams outside of the NET top 100, meaning that they don't have any bad losses. But the committee doesn't have a great history of doing the right thing when it comes to mid-major programs.\nThe good news for Gonzaga is that the teams ranked around it in the last top 16 reveal \u2014 Oklahoma, Indiana and Colorado \u2014 haven't played all that well lately. Oklahoma lost in the Big 12 tournament semifinals, Indiana was upset by Michigan in the Big Ten quarterfinals, and Colorado was bounced from the Pac-12 tournament by Oregon State.\n\nGannett may earn revenue from sports betting operators for audience referrals to betting services.

The Niners have reached four NFC conference championship games in the last five seasons and have zero rings to show for it.\nHere are some predictions for Super Bowl 58 in Las Vegas.\nBig game action: \nAmericans are expected to wager an eye-popping $23 billion on 2024 Super Bowl\nSuper Bowl 58 Predictions, Chiefs vs. 49ers:\nUSA Today\n:\n 49ers (-2)\nLorenzo Reyes likes the 49ers due to their more complete roster. Reyes even goes as far as to say that he would take the 49ers up to -2.5.\nBetMGM\n:\n Chiefs ML (+110)\nBetMGM's model gives the Chiefs a 52 percent chance to win the game. If the underdog is projected to win, betting their moneyline is a solid bet. However, if you're looking to play it a little safer, Chiefs (+2) would also be a winning combination as BetMGM gives the Chiefs a 53% chance to cover the spread.\nCBS Sports\n:\n 49ers to lead at half, Chiefs to win the game\nJared Dubin writes, \"The Chiefs haven't led at halftime of any of their three Super Bowl appearances in this era (they were tied with the Niners and trailing both the Bucs and Eagles), so if you think the Chiefs will win, this is better value than just taking the money line.\"\nFOX Sports\n:\n Chiefs 27, 49ers 24\nBen Arthur writes, \"The Niners have the more complete team, and it wouldn't surprise me if their offense was able to move the ball effectively against an elite Chiefs defense. But I just can't count out Patrick Mahomes rising to the occasion on the biggest stage.\"\nSports Illustrated\n:\n First score to be Chiefs rushing touchdown (+750)\nMark Lammey understands that this is a bold claim, but he believes either Isiah Pacheco or Patrick Mahomes will be the first person to score a touchdown in Super Bowl 58. At the end of they day, Lammey just isn't sure who will win the game, writing \"We expect San Francisco to look great in the second half to make this an epic matchup.\" However, given San Francisco's ineffectiveness against the run this postseason, Lammey likes Pacheco to find the endzone early.\nSuper Bowl 58, Chiefs-49ers odds and lines:\nThe 49ers are\u00a0favorites\u00a0to defeat the Chiefs, according to the\u00a0\nBetMGM NFL odds\n.

        "summary": "This offseason has been a strong one for Ohio State football. With multiple transfers coming in as well as multiple stars on both sides of the ball forgoing the NFL draft to come back to the Buckeyes for the 2024 season, hopes are high among Buckeye nation.\nOhio State has also gotten some good news on the recruiting front in the offseason. The Buckeyes wrapped up one of the best 2024 classes in college football by bringing in Julian Sayin, the top ranked quarterback in the class who transferred from Alabama after Nick Saban's retirement.\nThe Buckeyes have also landed some big commitments out of the 2025 class including 4-star offensive tackle Carter Lowe who committed to Ohio State on Saturday.\nWith Lowe already on board the Buckeyes are in good shape at offensive tackle for the 2025 class. However ideally, they might need to land one of two more players at the position.\nThus far, Ohio State has offered Lowe and ten other offensive tackles in the 2025 class. We'll walk through each of those using On3 who is one of the top college football recruiting resources that tracks player rankings on all four main websites and provides predictions, insights, and NIL valuations.\n#BOOM Ohio State adds a priority offensive tackle to its 2025 class by landing the commitment of Carter Lowe. https://t.co/M6asW9V8iM\n\u2014 Eleven Warriors (@11W) January 27, 2024\n\nRecruiting Class | 2025\nHigh School | Whitmer (Toledo, OH)\nHeight/Weight | 6-5, 285\nOn 3 NIL Valuation | $74K Annual Value\nOn3 Industry | 4 Star No. 85 Natl No. 9 OT No. 3 OH\nOn 3 | 4 Star No. 172 Natl No. 13 OT No. 10 OH\n247Sports | 4 Star No. 32 Natl No. 4 OT No. 2 OH\nESPN | 4 Star No. 146 Natl No. 20 OT No. 6 OH\nRivals | 4 Star No. 91 Natl No. 10 OT No. 3 OH\nCurrent Leader | Ohio State (Committed 1/27/2024)\nOhio State Prediction % | 96.8%\nOhio State Visits | 8 (second most of any team)\n2025 5-star OT David Sanders is coveted by many of the top programs in the county and he updates his recruitment: https://t.co/XhWtSoIimK (On3+) pic.twitter.com/LqigKikU4I\n\u2014 ChadSimmons (@ChadSimmons_) January 23, 2024\n\nRecruiting Class | 2025\nHigh School | Providence Day School (Charlotte, NC)\nHeight/Weight | 6-5.5, 250\nOn 3 NIL Valuation | $185K Annual Value\nOn3 Industry | 5 Star No. 2 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC\nOn 3 | 4 Star No. 5 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC\n247Sports | 5 Star No. 2 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC\nESPN | 5 Star No. 3 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC\nRivals | 5 Star No. 1 Natl No. 1 OT No. 1 NC\nCurrent Leader | Georgia\nOhio State Prediction % | 2.3%\nOhio State Visits | 1 (tied for ninth most of any team)\nLewisville 2025 On3 Industry Rankings four-star OT Michael Fasusi hitting the second levelhttps://t.co/GOhtJvUhfa pic.twitter.com/mt9Nf5imjT\n\u2014 Griffin McVeigh (@Griffin_McVeigh) September 2, 2023\n\nRecruiting Class | 2025\nHigh School | Lewisville (Lewisville, TX)\nHeight/Weight | 6-4.5, 300\nOn 3 NIL Valuation | $132K Annual Value\nOn3 Industry | 5 Star No. 2 OT No. 4 TX\nOn 3 | 4 Star No. 36 Natl No. 5 OT No. 8 TX\n247Sports | 4 Star No. 39 Natl No. 5 OT No. 6 TX\nESPN | 5 Star No. 10 Natl No. 3 OT No. 2 TX\nRivals | 5 Star No. 11 Natl No. 3 OT No. 4 TX\nCurrent Leader | Oklahoma\nOhio State Prediction % | <1%\nOhio State Visits | None\n5.

        "summary": "Feb 7, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; The Super Bowl 58 roman numerals on the Allegiant Stadium facade. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nThe day has finally arrived for the crowning of the \nSuper Bowl LVIII\n champions.\nThe \nSan Francisco 49ers\n, led by \nBrock Purdy\n, will compete against the \nKansas City Chiefs\n, led by \nPatrick Mahomes\n, for the Vince Lombardi Trophy at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.\nThis will be the Chiefs' sixth Super Bowl appearance and fourth in the last five seasons. Kansas City is looking to win back-to-back Super Bowls for the first time since the New England Patriots in 2003 and 2004.\nThroughout the regular season, quarterback Purdy has led a team of talented San Francisco playmakers. The 49ers had an impressive 12-5 season and could arguably be considered the most consistent team in the league. The 49ers will now make their eighth appearance in the Super Bowl in franchise history, with hopes of winning the Lombardi Trophy for the first time since Super Bowl 29 in 1994.\nHere are the predictions for \nSuper Bowl LVIII\n just a few hours before the kickoff.\nNFL: \nDeion Sanders on all things football ahead of Super Bowl LVIII\n2024 Super Bowl predictions for San Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs\nBetMGM\n: Chiefs to win their third Super Bowl in five years\nStaff writes: \"For the entire season, the 49ers are 25th in rush EPA per play allowed and 27th in rushing success rate allowed.\u00a0Even since acquiring Chase Young in Week 10, they're 19th in rush EPA per play allowed and 23rd in rush success rate allowed.\u00a0Although the Chiefs managed only 2.8 yards per attempt on the ground in Baltimore, they thrived in earlier postseason games.\u00a0Against the Bills and Dolphins, who finished the regular season 17th and 16th in rush defense DVOA, they averaged 6.1 and 4.3 yards per rush, respectively.\u00a0Given the 49ers ranked 15th in rush defense DVOA during the regular season, expect Kansas City to dominate on the ground.\u00a0Lastly, Patrick Mahomes is 11-1-1 ATS as an underdog for his career, and postseason underdogs that move by at least half a point are 69.2% ATS.\u00a0For those reasons, take the Chiefs to win their third Super Bowl in five years.\"\nCBS Sports\n: Chiefs to beat the 49ers in a 24-23 thriller\nLarry Hartstein writes: \"The Chiefs are set to play in their fourth Super Bowl in five years, meaning they have a plethora of experience on their roster. Quarterback Patrick Mahomes already has 14 career playoff wins, tied with Terry Bradshaw, John Elway, and Peyton Manning for the third-most by a QB in NFL history. With another victory on Super Bowl Sunday, Mahomes and the Chiefs will become the first team to win back-to-back Super Bowls since the New England Patriots in 2003-04. Hartstein expects the Chiefs to rely on their experience down the stretch again, pulling out a narrow win over the 49ers.\"\nESPN\n: 49ers have a 59% chance to win\nAccording to the ESPN Matchup Predictor, the San Francisco 49ers have a 59.4% chance of beating the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl LVIII.\nFOX Sports\n:\u00a0Chiefs 27, 49ers 24\nBen Arthur writes, \"The Niners have the more complete team, and it wouldn't surprise me if their offense was able to move the ball effectively against an elite Chiefs defense. But I just can't count out Patrick Mahomes rising to the occasion on the biggest stage.\"\nSporting News\n: Chiefs 30, 49ers 24\nBill Bender writes: \"Kansas City has allowed more than 24 points in one game this season, and that defense might make the difference in the fourth quarter one more time. If the Chiefs need a score with the game on the line late, then can you trust Mahomes? San Francisco allowed 26 points per game in the playoffs. This will be a 27-24 game either way, and our guess is Mahomes finds a way to win a third Super Bowl.\"\nNew York Post\n: 49ers\nSean Treppedi writes: \"Brock Purdy continues to be unvalidated for irrelevant reasons, such as his draft position, yet he continues to extract the best from the talent around him while taking plays into his own hands when needed. Isn't that the textbook description of a successful quarterback? Either that or a league-leading 72.7 QBR and a 113.3 passer rating.\u00a0We love to get caught up in narratives, and there is certainly plenty to discuss with two perennial contenders for the better part of a decade. But when it comes down to what's on the field, let's call it square on two top-three defenses in points allowed.\u00a0 I see this as the unrelenting chemistry between Mahomes and Travis Kelce \u2014\u00a0who connected on all 11 attempts against Baltimore \u2014 against an overwhelming cast of star power.\u00a0Mahomes' connection with Kelce has accounted for more than 36 percent of his air yardage in the playoffs. Calling him a one-trick pony would be ignorant, but the 49ers are deploying four players with 100-plus total yards in the playoffs. They more than doubled the Chiefs in average scoring margin. Whether Vegas perceives Mahomes as an underdog or not, the public will always favor him at this point. Ignore the storylines and take the early edge with San Francisco.\"\nBleacher Report\n: Chiefs 27, 49ers 21\nStaff writes: \"The game between the Chiefs and 49ers will be a rematch of Super Bowl LIV, when Kansas City won 31-20. Kansas City came into Sunday's AFC Championship Game as an underdog, but Mahomes\u00a0\nsaid\n\u00a0the Chiefs \"never feel like underdogs.\" As far as the odds are concerned, though, they will be underdogs once again against the 49ers in the Super Bowl. Compared to the last three Chiefs teams that reached the Super Bowl, this one didn't dominate throughout the regular season and faced plenty of doubt heading into the postseason. Kansas City proved this year, however, that any team coached by Andy Reid and led by Mahomes has a fighting chance. San Francisco came into the season hungry for a Super Bowl, and the 49ers have looked like one of the top teams in football all year. Led by star running back Christian McCaffrey and promising quarterback Brock Purdy, the 49ers certainly have what it takes to keep up with Kansas City's electric offense. With a powerful offense and a more than capable defense, the 49ers will look to avenge the Super Bowl loss from 2019. However, with the way Mahomes has played this postseason, the Chiefs will be tough to beat.\"\nSan Francisco 49ers vs. Kansas City Chiefs Chiefs odds, spread and lines for Super Bowl LVIII\nThe 49ers are\u00a0favorites\u00a0to defeat the Chiefs, according to the\u00a0\nBetMGM NFL odds\n.

(Photo by)\nFashanu is also very young for a top offensive tackle prospect, as he'll start playing his rookie season at just 21 years old. Despite his age, he's already proven to be a top offensive tackle. He could very well end up as one of the best players of this class as he has a very, very high ceiling with a relatively high floor as well.\nOct 8, 2022; Stanford, California, USA; Oregon State Beavers offensive lineman Taliese Fuaga (75) blocks Stanford Cardinal linebacker Levani Damuni (3) during the first quarter at Stanford Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\nFuaga is the best right tackle in the class, which the Saints might need to focus on soon with the Ramczyk knee situation. He had a stellar Senior Bowl as well a good combine. He's a better run blocker than a pass blocker, but projects to be good at both in the NFL.\nDec 1, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Washington Huskies offensive lineman Troy Fautanu (55) celebrates after the Huskies scored against the Oregon Ducks during the first quarter at Allegiant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports\nBack to looking at left tackles, Fautanu is another high-level athlete (something this class is not short on). He projects as a position versatile lineman that could work out in different roles thanks to his athletic ceiling.\nSep 30, 2023; Starkville, Mississippi, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide offensive lineman JC Latham (65) celebrates with a cow bell in Davis Wade Stadium at Mississippi State University. Alabama defeated Mississippi State 40-17. Mandatory Credit: Gary Cosby Jr.-Tuscaloosa News\nHe's another young tackle, but also has a lot of experience starting in the SEC. He didn't run a 40-yard dash, but moves very well. He has all of the tools to be a great tackle, but needs to improve more on the mental side of the position.\nOct 28, 2023; Lawrence, Kansas, USA; Oklahoma Sooners offensive lineman Tyler Guyton (60) at the line of scrimmage against the Kansas Jayhawks during the game at David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\nGuyton is probably the most raw of anyone on this list, but is still an exciting player. He played defensive end in high school but made the switch to the offensive side in college. He's huge and a great athlete, but still has plenty to learn.\nJan 9, 2023; Inglewood, CA, USA; Georgia Bulldogs offensive lineman Amarius Mims (65) and offensive lineman Tate Ratledge (69) against the TCU Horned Frogs during the CFP national championship game at SoFi Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\nMims is more of a high-ceiling, low floor kind of prospect, which is something the Saints tend to gravitate towards. He's big and strong, but not the most polished player in the class. He is also coming off of an injury in 2023 and even suffered one while running the 40-yard dash. He might be the most Saints prospect of all time.",

That's when she knew the magnitude of the game.\nCasinelli is now working at Super Bowl 58 as a reporter for Univision when it broadcasts the matchup between the \nSan Francisco 49ers\n and \nKansas City Chiefs\n in Spanish. This is the first year the 78-year-old media company will broadcast the big game.\n\"It's incredible for me that so many years later, I'm gonna have the opportunity to be in the first historic transmission for the Super Bowl,\" she told USA TODAY Sports.\nVote now! \nRate this year's Super Bowl commercials\nUnivision has humble roots as the first Hispanic-owned, Spanish-speaking radio station in the country. In 2022, it was the \nNo. 1 broadcast network in weeknight primetime\n, beating out ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox with an average audience of 1.6 million viewers. The Spanish-language channel has become a household name because of its coverage of elections, entertainment and other large sports events like the World Cup, all with flavor and energy that is signature to Latin American and Hispanic cultures.\nOlek Loewenstein, Univision's president of global sports business, said the 'planets aligned' for Univision to host its first Super Bowl, which will be a partnership with CBS. The Spanish-language network's goals aligned with those of the NFL, including growing the sport's audience and expanding the ways Univision connects with its community.\n\"For us, the perfect way to do that is through the big moments in sports,\" he said, \"and you can't talk about big moments in sports in the U.S. without being part of the big game.\"\nFeb 5, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Helmets for the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs on display with the Vince Lombardi Trophy before NFL commissioner Roger Goodell speaks at a press conference in advance of Super Bowl LVIII between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers at Allegiant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nThe NFL has struggled in the past to connect with its Latin American and Hispanic fanbase. Its \n\"\u00d1FL\" campaign struck a sour note\n with many and the \nWashington Commanders released the only head coach of Latin American descent when they fired Ron Rivera last month\n. \nDave Canales, who is Mexican-American, was named the head coach of the Carolina Panthers weeks later\n. The league has the International Player Pathway program to encourage players from outside the United States to join the league.\nTelemundo, a member of NBCUniversal, was the first broadcast network to air the Super Bowl in Spanish in 2022. Their broadcast averaged 1.9 million viewers, \nper NBC Sports\n. The next year, the broadcast was hosted by Fox Deportes and saw a viewership of 951,000 fans, \naccording to Fox Sports\n.\nLoewenstein said what makes Univsion unique is that the company is its own entity and has a completely independent editorial process. He also noted how Univision's intention to connect organically with each members of its community separates it from SAP audio slapped over an English language broadcast.\n\"We believe in our goal for this,\" Loewenstein said. \"Our absolute objective for this game is to deliver the most-watched Super Bowl in Spanish language history in the U.S. Period.\"\nUnivision will technically have two broadcasts: one in the United States and it will continue its Televisa broadcast in Mexico.\nThis will be the first Super Bowl for Jorge Ramos, who is a household name as a news reporter for Univision. Guillermo \"Memo\" Schutz and Ramses Sandoval will be calling the game. It's Sandoval's first Super Bowl as well. Even though Schutz has covered the Super Bowl for the Televisa Mexico broadcast and Sandoval has covered large sports events like the World Cup, NBA Finals and Messi's first game with Inter Miami CF, both felt the magnitude of calling the Super Bowl.\n\"You can make a case it's one of the biggest things I've ever done,\" Schutz said. \"We're preparing as it's the most important thing I've ever done.\"\n\"I can tell you from the inside the importance that this company is taking this event with. It's really, it's massive. It's impressive. As it should be, it's the Super Bowl,\" Sandoval said. \"Having the opportunity and being on the air as the play-by-play caller is a massive responsibility. . . . The amount of people that are watching you and are listening to you, I don't take that responsibility lightly. It's very exciting.\"\nUnivision is gathering a well-rounded team of experts to meet its audience at all entry points. Many in the Hispanic and Latin American community, where soccer is king, might not know the fundamentals of the game, so the team is preparing content to help explain what's going on. But there are also those born in the United States whose parents bought them NFL jerseys at birth. So the team is mindful of connecting with all points on the spectrum of American football knowledge.\n\"Some folks don't understand the game, the language, but also, it's an excuse to be together,\" Univision's senior vice president of live events Miguel Angel Garcia said. \"One of the most important things that we were planning since the beginning is how do we put together a Super Bowl for everyone at home watching?\"\nThere are a few players in the Super Bowl with Latin American heritage, including 49ers linebacker Fred Warner and defensive lineman Jon Feliciano.\nCasinelli said she appreciates the underdog stories of Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco and San Francisco quarterback Brock Purdy.\nAnd Sandoval said he's looking forward to Usher playing the halftime show because he remembers \"Yeah!\" being played at his senior prom.\n\"We Latinos always look for connections,\" Schutz said. \"... We love football, we love connections and we're going to find it in the Super Bowl.\"\nBesides Schutz and Sandoval, \nflag football champion Diana Flores from Mexico\n and Super Bowl-winning kicker Mart\u00edn Gram\u00e1tica, who hails from Argentina, will assist with coverage. Ramos and Casinelli will be hosting pre-game coverage from Caesars Palace. The Super Bowl being in Las Vegas for the first time offers more opportunity to connect fans with a good time.",

        "summary": "Jan 30, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; The Super Bowl LVIII logo at the NFL Las Vegas store at Caesar's Palace. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nSuper Bowl 58\n between the \nSan Francisco 49ers\n and \nKansas City Chiefs\n has arrived with ample opportunity to watch the game and wager on nearly every aspect of it. The big game prop bets are the best part of the event, and we have you covered on a downloadable sheet you can print at home.\nBetting on the Super Bowl is a long-standing tradition unlike any other. Where professional sports bettors may use every detail they've crammed into their craniums in order to pick winners during the regular season or determine whether or not certain teams will score more or less points than their projections, the Super Bowl offers a variety of bets that even casual bettors can challenge the pros on.\nThe big game should be no different. Even if you are not an \nNFL\n savant, there are a myriad of fun wagers to place this weekend. Here are some of our favorites from \nBetMGM\n, \nFanDuel\n, \nDraftKings\n, and \nCaesars Sportsbook\n.\nWell kept secret: \nBrandon Aiyuk is finally catching attention as vital piece of 49ers' Super Bowl run\nBest novelty prop bets for Super Bowl LVIII:\nSuper Bowl prop sheet: \nDownload your prop sheet for the big game\nPopular Super Bowl prop bets\nPlayer props are much more predictable than novelty props for obvious reasons. You can use history and statistics to determine whether or not a player's rushing yards prop or touchdown prop is too low or too high, but predicting what color Gatorade the Chiefs have in their cooler is a near impossible feat, but not totally impossible.\nGatorade bath:\nWith each prop that has to do with something outside of the game itself, there is usually some history and context that can give you a small advantage. For example, while blue is being given the second-best odds for the post-game Gatorade bath, the Chiefs have won the Super Bowl twice in the last four years and did not dump blue Gatorade on head coach Andy Reid either time. In all fairness, of the last five Super Bowls, the other three have all seen blue Gatorade, but that's assuming the 49ers will have blue Gatorade in their cooler, which is a big assumption.\nSurprisingly, the most popular Gatorade color since 2000 has been orange. The Chiefs already dumped orange Gatorade on Andy Reid once after winning the Super Bowl in 2020, so at +500 odds, orange seems like a solid bet.\nCoin Toss:\nThe coin toss is undoubtedly a true 50-50, but tails has historically been the more popular choice. Seven of the last ten opening coin tosses have landed tails. Even as a whole, the Super Bowl has seen 27 heads to 30 tails, meaning anyone who bet tails on all 57 Super Bowls has seen a profit. Furthermore, while heads has the longest consecutive streak, hitting five straight times between Super Bowls 43 and 47, there have also been three separate streaks of four consecutive tails.\nCoin Toss:\n Heads (-105); Tails (-105) -- BetMGM\nCoin Toss winner\n: 49ers (-105); Chiefs(-105) -- BetMGM\nColor of Gatorade Bath:\n Purple (+225); Blue (+275); Yellow/Green (+450); Red/Pink (+450); Orange (+500); Clear/Water (+1000); No Gatorade Bath (+2000) -- BetMGM\nFirst Team to call Timeout:\n 49ers (-115); Chiefs (-115) -- BetMGM\nFirst Team to attempt a coaches challenge:\n Chiefs (-115); 49ers (-115) -- DraftKings\nWill the final score be a scorigami?:\n Yes (+2000); No (-10000) -- DraftKings\nOpening Kickoff Result: \nTouchback (-360); Returned (+265) -- DraftKings\nOpening Kickoff Returned for Touchdown: \nYes (+5000) -- DraftKings\nWill the first play from scrimmage result in a first down?:\n Yes (+340); No (-500) -- DraftKings\nTotal Yards Gained on First Play:\n Over 3.5 (-115); Under 3.5 (-110) -- DraftKings\nWho will have more Receiving Yards?:\n Brandon Aiyuk (-6.5); Deebo Samuel (+6.5) -- FanDuel\nFumble lost in the first half?:\n Yes (+128); No (-158) -- FanDuel\nChristian McCaffrey Anytime TD: \n(-220) -- FanDuel\nNick Bosa to record 2 or more sacks: \n(+350) -- DraftKings\nTravis Kelce to have 11 or more receptions:\n (+550) -- DraftKings\nFirst interception of the game:\n Mike Edwards (+900); Tashaun Gipson Sr. (+900); L'Jarius Sneed (+1000); Deommodore Lenoir (+1200); Ji'Ayir Brown (+1400); Charvarius Ward (+1800) -- BetMGM\nWill Patrick Mahomes throw an interception?: \nYes (-130); No (+100) -- BetMGM\nWill Brock Purdy throw an interception?: \nYes (+100); No (-135) -- BetMGM\nWill there be a touchdown from the 1-yard line?: \nYes (-170); No (+138) -- FanDuel\nWill Christian McCaffrey's longest rush be for 18 or more yards?:\n Yes (-120); No (-110) -- BetMGM\nNFL News: \nCommanders name former Cowboys defensive coordinator, Dan Quinn, new head coach\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

        "summary": "Jan 30, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; San Francisco 49ers and Kansas Chiefs helmets and the Vince Lombardi trophy at the Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas sign. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\nWhether it's Taylor Swift or just a newfound interest in the \nNFL\n, there are thousands of people ready to experience the joy of betting on the \nSuper Bowl \nfor the first time. A Vegas betting guide is just what you need to find out how to bet, where to wager and the gambling terms you need to enjoy the process.\nIf you are one of the lucky few looking to embark on this journey, welcome. This can be a very fun addition to an already great day. However, this can get addictive.\nObviously, this is something you should do responsibly. Don't waste away money you can't afford to lose. If you cannot hold yourself accountable, have a friend do so. And if you lose, don't force yourself to bet more money in order to make up what you lost. Go into every bet you make assuming you've already lost, and remember that sometimes the best bet is no bet at all.\nWith that out of the way, let's talk about what you need to know if you're looking to add a little bit of spice to Super Bowl LVIII.\nBest of the best: \nThe 58 greatest NFL teams to play in the Super Bowl \u2013 and not all won Lombardi Trophy\nWhere can you bet on sports?\nIf you are looking to bet online, there are a multitude of sportsbooks to choose from. The most popular sportsbooks include \nDraftKings\n, \nBetMGM\n, \nCaesars Sportsbook\n, and \nFanDuel\n.\nUse this promo code with BetMGM: \nLooking to wager? Use this promo code for a free offer with BetMGM\nWhere is sports betting legal?\nSports betting is currently legal in 27 states and Washington D.C.\nArizona\nArkansas\nColorado\nConnecticut\nIllinois\nIndiana\nIowa\nKansas\nKentucky\nLouisiana\nMaryland\nMassachusetts\nMichigan\nNevada\nNew Hampshire\nNew Jersey\nNew York\nNorth Carolina (only in-person)\nOhio\nOregon\nPennsylvania\nRhode Island\nTennessee (only online)\nVirginia\nWashington D.C.\nWest Virginia\nWyoming (only online)\nBetting terms to know:\nFavorite:\n This is the team that is expected to win the game, according to oddsmakers\nUnderdog:\n The team that is expected to lose\nSpread:\n The spread is the amount of points that Vegas and/or other oddsmakers believe the favorite will win by. The favorite is indicated by a minus sign (-) being displayed before the spread, while the underdog is indicated with a plus sign (+). For example, if the San Francisco 49ers are expected to beat the Kansas City Chiefs by two points, the spread would be San Francisco (-2) or Kansas City (+2).\nCover the spread:\n Covering the spread is determined by whether or not you would have won money if you placed a wager on either team. For example, if the spread was San Francisco (-2), but the 49ers only won by one point, the 49ers would win, but they would not cover the spread. Anybody who put money on the 49ers would lose their bet. On the other side, if the Kansas City Chiefs were +2 underdogs, and lost by one, they would lose the game, but would still cover the spread.\nAgainst the spread:\n Occasionally abbreviated to ATS, this is simply how many times a team covered the spread versus how many times they failed to cover the spread. For example, the Kansas City Chiefs have a record of 14-6 across the regular season and playoffs, but only covered the spread in 12 of their 20 games. They also tied the spread meaning they won or lost a game by exactly how many points they were the favorite or underdog. The Chiefs' record ATS this season is 12-7-1.\nPush:\n A push is when neither you nor the sportsbook wins the bet so you get your money back, but nothing extra. In the example stated earlier, if you put money on San Francisco (-2), and the 49ers won by two points exactly, that would be a push. The sportsbook would reimburse you for your bet, but no other money would change hands.\nMoneyline:\n If you don't feel comfortable betting the spread, you can bet the moneyline. The moneyline is a bet you can place on who will win the game based on the final score, regardless of margin. If the 49ers are favored by two and win by one but you bet their moneyline, you would still win, even though the 49ers failed to cover the spread. Where bets on the spread tend to pay out close to a 1:1 ratio, bets on the moneyline pay out less than 1:1 if you bet on the favorite and more if you bet on the underdog. Essentially, if you bet the underdog's moneyline, you will win more than double your initial wager. If you bet the favorite's moneyline, you will earn less than double your initial wager.\nOver/Under:\n Think of over/under as less of a term and more of a question. \"At the end of the game, do you think the total amount of points scored by both teams will be over or under a certain number?\" BetMGM has the over/under for this Super Bowl set at 47.5, meaning they expect the Chiefs and 49ers to total 47.5 points between them. If the final score of the game is 24-23, the teams would have combined for 47 points, which is under the 47.5 line that BetMGM set, so the under would hit.\nYou can also bet the over/under on certain player stats, such as receiving yards, passing touchdowns, rushing yards, etc. For example, BetMGM lists 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey's total rushing yards at 90.5. You can place a wager on whether he will record greater or fewer rushing yards than that at the end of the game.\nParlay:\n A parlay is a series of wagers that must all win order to secure the payout. You can parlay as many wagers together as you like, and each wager adds another leg to the parlay. For example, a four-leg parlay would have four different wagers that all need to hit in order to win. A seven-leg parlay would have seven different wagers.\nIf you're asking yourself \"Why would anyone do that if you need to win more bets?\", it is because the payouts are much larger with parlays than they are with straight bets. While hitting three individual bets at $100 each might win you $300, you still had to risk $300. If you had parlayed those bets together, you would have only needed to risk $100, and if all three legs hit, you would have walked away with $600.\nThese are the riskiest types of bets. While you are not risking as much money, you need more events to happen correctly in order to win.\nBig game action: \nBest Super Bowl LVIII player prop bets for Chiefs-49ers you can place right now\nLive betting:\n Live betting, also referred to as \"In-Play\" or \"In-Game\" betting, is a bet placed after the game has started. Sportsbooks will change the odds of games as they are happening. For example, while the Super Bowl might open with the 49ers as two-point favorites, if the Chiefs were to go up 14-0 at the end of the first quarter, the sportsbook might offer new odds that reflect the current score. Perhaps something like Kansas City (-6).\nIf somebody placed money on the outcome prior to the start of the game, the new odds do not affect their bet. So, unfortunately, your friend who put money on San Francisco (-2) would still need the 49ers to win by more than two points in order to win.\nProp Bet:\n A prop (short for proposition) bet is any bet that doesn't have anything to do with the final score of the game.\nPlayer Prop:\n A player prop is betting on a specific player to do something. In the over/under section a few paragraphs ago, I talked about how Christian McCaffrey rushing yard line is set at 90.5. That would be an example of a prop bet. Other prop bets include whether or not a specific player will score a touchdown at some point during the game. That is called an \"Anytime TD\" bet. There are also \"First TD\" wagers, which attempt to predict the first player to score a touchdown in the game. There are even Super Bowl MVP bets, which as you would expect, are wagers on who will be named MVP of the game. All of these are examples of player props.\nNovelty/Party Prop:\n Novelty/party props are prop bets that have little to nothing to do with the game at all. These are arguably the most notorious Super Bowl bets. Different sites will have different novelty props, but some of the more well-known ones are \"What color Gatorade will be poured on the winning head coach after the game?\", \"Will the opening coin toss be heads or tails?\", and \"Will the national anthem be shorter or longer than a predetermined amount of time?\"\nIf you do not know football very well and are looking for something to cheer for while watching the game, these props might be the best way to go.\nWhat are some common bets you might encounter?\nWe've already covered most of the different types of bets, but what bets are the most popular? The most popular bets are usually the spread. People tend to bet the spread because it usually has close to a 1-to-1 payout and it gives the underdog a little more leeway.\nSome people believe that, in football, any spread less than three points is essentially just a pick 'em, meaning you just pick who you think is going to win. However, there is still that small chance that the favorite wins by fewer than three points.\nSuper Bowl 58: \nVegas odds for spread, moneyline, over/under\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

        "summary": "As the 2023-24 women's college basketball season winds down, we're going to get announcements \u2013 perhaps on senior nights, or in the forms of social media graphics \u2013 of seniors announcing whether they will use their extra year of eligibility.\nBecause of the NCAA's rule during the COVID-19 pandemic, the 2020-21 season did not count towards a player's eligibility clock. So, anyone who played that season has had the chance to play an extra season of college basketball. This has created an overflowing transfer portal, older teams, and to some degree, increased parity in the sport of women's basketball.\nThe 2020-21 freshman class was a star-studded one, and the final class that will benefit from this rule. UConn's Paige Bueckers has already announced her return, while decisions loom for other superstar players like Iowa's Caitlin Clark, LSU's Angel Reese, Stanford's Cameron Brink and North Carolina's Deja Kelly. Don't be surprised if some of these players decide not to enter the WNBA Draft. We saw several of the game's top players return to school last season.\nWith this list, we'll keep track of all the players who have publicly declared that they will return to women's college basketball for another season in the 2024-25 campaign:\nUpdated: Feb. 24\nUNCASVILLE, CONNECTICUT \u2013 DECEMBER 10: Paige Bueckers #5 of the UConn Huskies celebrates in the first quarter against the North Carolina Tar Heels at Mohegan Sun Arena on December 10, 2023 in Uncasville, Connecticut. (Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images)\nBueckers was projected by many to be a top-five pick in this year's WNBA Draft, but it's clear that she feels like she has some unfinished business with the Huskies. Since leading UConn to back-to-back Final Fours as a freshman and sophomore, Bueckers' time at UConn has been plagued with injuries to her and her teammates.\nShe's stayed healthy this season, but teammates like Azzi Fudd, Aubrey Griffin and Caroline Ducharme have been sidelined. Bueckers \u2013 and Griffin \u2013 will return to UConn for one more run at a championship next season.\nDec 8, 2022; Storrs, Connecticut, USA; Princeton Tigers guard Kaitlyn Chen (20) drives the ball against UConn Huskies forward Lou Lopez-Senechal (11) in the second half at Harry A. Gampel Pavilion. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\nChen is going to play another year of college basketball, but it won't be at Princeton. The Ivy League generally does not allow graduate students to compete in varsity athletics, so Chen's eligibility in the conference will expire this spring. So, she's been in the portal since September while having a great season for the Tigers, averaging 16 points, 4.6 assists and 3.2 rebounds per game while shooting 37.3% from 3-point land.\nThe Ivy League is a tough mid-major conference and good players from the league have provided big boosts to major programs over the past few years as transfers. Harvard's McKenzie Forbes is USC's second-leading scorer this season behind JuJu Watkins, and Princeton's Abby Meyers helped Maryland make the Elite Eight last season before getting drafted.\nThe Ivy League didn't play during Chen's freshman season, so next year will be her fourth college basketball campaign.\nMarch 7, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Gonzaga Bulldogs forward Yvonne Ejim (15) shoots the basketball against the Portland Pilots during the first half in the finals of the WCC Basketball Championships at Orleans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nOne of the top forwards in the country, Ejim has led the Bulldogs in scoring this season with 20.2 points per game as they have won 21 straight games and put themselves in position to potentially host NCAA Tournament games as a top-16 seed.\nEjim is the only player in the country (as of Feb. 24) averaging at least 20 points, eight rebounds, two assists and one block per game. She's been crucial to Gonzaga's success this season and has showed she can play with anyone in the country. In the Bulldogs' Dec. 3 win over Stanford, she had 27 points and 12 rebounds.\nKyla Jones goes up past Providence's Olivia Olsen on Nov. 15, 2023. (David DelPoio / USA TODAY NETWORK)\nLike Chen, Jones will return to another season of college basketball next year, but it will be at a school other than Brown. Jones has been in the transfer portal since December while playing well for the Bears this season, averaging 16.7 points, 4.6 rebounds and 2.8 assists per game. She's scored more than 1,000 points in her career at Brown and should be able to help a major conference program next season.",

Tybura is also competent from both stances and will typically shift when coming forward.\nI don't know what Marcin Tybura keeps doing with his left hand but it gives me all the pop music video vibes from Paula Abdul to The Backstreet Boys\u2026\nThe man fights like a puppeteer is controlling only his left wrist while the rest of his body has a jam session pic.twitter.com/Wef6AA5IWO\n\u2014 Dan Tom (@DanTomMMA) July 20, 2023\n\nStill, Tybura isn't beyond being countered due to his strange defensive gestures and will need to be on his best behavior when trading with Tai Tuivasa.\nFrom flying knees to crushing elbows, Tuivasa bears all the weapons to keep his opponents up at night. A former boxer and longtime training partner to Australia's top fighters (which includes the likes of Mark Hunt and Tyson Pedro), Tuivasa carries a bit more experience than meets the eye.\nDespite still having to cut a bit of weight to make the heavyweight limit, Tuivasa moves deceptively well for a man of his size. The former Rugby stud's athleticism especially shines through with his ability to quickly close distances, going from flicking jabs to blitzing combinations at the drop of a dime.\nTuivasa can sometimes get lost and out of position during extended exchanges, but the 30-year-old has seemed to sharpen his kicks and counters since he split time between Thailand and his personalized training camps in Dubai (where he also worked with professional heavyweight kickboxers).\nNow, it is not uncommon to see Tuivasa target the legs of his opponents with impunity \u2013 all while keeping hard, checking hooks in tow for anyone trying to enter off of his kicks. That said, I'm not sure how much Tuivasa will be kicking against his current counterpart given the Polish fighter's propensity to catch and counter kicks.\nSep 3, 2022; Paris, FRANCE; Ciryl Gane (red gloves) and Tai Tuivasa (blue gloves) during UFC Fight Night at Accor Arena. Mandatory Credit: Per Haljestam-USA TODAY Sports\nConsidering Tybura's obvious on-paper edge, I will be curious to see how fast he looks to grapple with a hard-hitting threat like Tuivasa.\nDespite not having as strong of an offensive grappling presence as you'd expect from a statistical perspective, Tybura deceptively looks to score takedowns in the open by baiting kicks out of his opposition. And when Tybura can successfully corral an opponent along the fence, the 13-year pro will then look to change his level for more traditional takedown entries with the goal of getting to the mat in top position.\nA black belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu, Tybura has translated his grappling game seamlessly into MMA. Doing his best work when on top, the Pole utilizes positioning fundamentals and shoulder pressure to help persuade his opposition into giving their back.\nOnce Tybura can establish some form of mount, he will quickly get to work with strikes to help set up his submission efforts.\nStill, I'd be careful about completely discounting someone like Tuivasa in closed-quarter combat.\nEven though Tuivasa is still susceptible to being taken down in spots, the 12-year pro has put work into his getup and transition game given the hustle he displays when swimming for underhooks or single-leg establishments to stand. And if Tuivasa can turn his opposition to the cage, then devastating elbows off of small frames are sure to follow.\nTybura has been finished in similar scenarios before (e.g. his fight with Derrick Lewis), so clinching sequences could be nail-biting for as long as they last.\nFeb 29, 2020; Norfolk, Virginia, USA; Marcin Tybura (red gloves) celebrates beating Serghei Spivac (blue gloves) during UFC Fight Night at Chartway Arena. Mandatory Credit: Peter Casey-USA TODAY Sports\nThe oddsmakers and the public are slightly favoring the native of Western Sydney, listing Tuivasa -128 and Tybura +100 via FanDuel.\nGiven the volatility of heavyweight MMA, I'm not surprised to see this tightly-lined betting spread at somewhat of a standstill.\nTuivasa is certainly the fan favorite in this spot, but his current three-fight losing skid could be keeping some of his backers at bay. Moreover, the stylistic matchup \u2013 coupled with the fighting terrain of the UFC Apex \u2013 makes for a deceptive challenge that Tuivasa will have to overcome this Saturday.\nAs I always say in my analysis, the cage side can make a decent difference depending on the stylistic matchup at hand.\nThe smaller octagon of the UFC Apex, for example, typically gives superior wrestlers and submission grapplers a slight edge given that action that the small cage encourages.\nDon't get me wrong: chaos is a two-way street that should favor the superior striker and athlete early, but if Tuivasa isn't able to get back to his quick-finishing ways then he could be in trouble come round 2.\nEven though Tuivasa has better cardio than given credit for, it's no secret that he's traditionally struggled when put on his back. Tybura may not be the most aggressive takedown artist in the world, but he's also one of the few heavyweights who can actually take the back with skill and savvy.\nDespite being a fan of Tuivasa and wanting him to snap this losing streak, I think that Tybura \u2013 akin to his fights with Greg Hardy and Walt Harris \u2013 can survive the early storms long enough to capitalize on a mistake and get this to the ground. The pick is Tybura by round-two submission.\n\nBe sure to visit the MMA Junkie Instagram page and YouTube channel to discuss this and more content with fans of mixed martial arts.",

Following her recent retirement from that role to move into new ventures, including a new show, she spoke to MMA Junkie Radio about her career and what's next.\nArianny Celeste, UFC 189\nI feel like I outgrew the whole ring girl thing and I became a woman \u2013 I became a mom and I was like, \u2018There has to be something that I can do that's a little bit more fulfilling within the company,' and I went ahead and pitched a show to Dana (White) and Craig Borsari, and they loved it. So here I am. I wasn't expecting to put the ring card girl thing down forever, but I think once Britney (Palmer) did, I was like, OK, I'm cool with it. I didn't need this big hurrah to be out of that because I kind of mentally was already out of the game of the ring card girl stuff. Getting the show just solidified everything for me.\n\nGallery\nPhotos: UFC octagon girl Arianny Celeste through the years\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nView\n\t\t\t\t25 photos\t\n\n\n\n\n\nI wouldn't mind (one final time). I still feel great in a bikini and I work out all the time, so it's not a matter of if I'm ready. But I guess if the fans would want to see it, they have to ask the boss.\nThat would be incredible (to work Noche UFC at The Sphere in Las Vegas in September). I've never been to that place, but it looks really, really cool. Maybe we'll have to start a campaign with the fans and see if they can tell Dana.\nCOACHELLA, CALIFORNIA \u2013 APRIL 14: Arianny Celeste attends Republic Records Celebrates Their Class Of 2019 In Coachella Valley at Zenyara on April 14, 2019 in Coachella, California. (Photo by Jerod Harris/Getty Images for Republic Records)\nI think I got as much as I could out of it. I made a career out of it. I made a whole life out of it. I was able to make a great living, and I said yes to pretty much every job that was thrown at me, every opportunity, every appearance, every nightclub thing, every signing, and I was able to create something for myself and become an entrepreneur and really take charge of my life, my finances, and all that. I feel really good about my journey as a ring girl, but now it's time to kind of move on I think\nI think there comes a time where you're just like, \u2018OK, I've been doing this for, man, like 18 years almost, 20 years. So what's next? What can I do within the company that's going to make me valuable, but also catapult me to where I'm a little bit more respected in the community, maybe? Yes, it's cute to walk around in a bikini, but can I do that forever and still be respected? I'm not sure. It's a hard question for me because obviously I like to keep it classy and sexy, but there just comes a time where you've got to move on, I think.\nI was able to turn a novelty into a career. Not a lot of ring girls have a career outside of what they do besides taking pictures and looking cute. I was able to turn it into a business. I got to model for some of the biggest companies. I got to shoot for some of the biggest magazines. I've just lived such an incredible life, and the rollercoaster that I've been on has been such a good one \u2013 a blessed, blessed life. I've seen so many different countries. I've met so many different people and the people that I work with now, they're just so \u2013 we all kind of look out for each other. It just feels nice to be a part of that kind of company where everyone's kind of rooting for each other.\n\n\n\nI've always seen myself on TV. I've always told people that Brooke Burke is my idol and I thought there is a missing piece within the UFC. Our fans are the biggest part of the sport. They're why we are here. So why not create a show that is based on our fans that will show appreciation to our fans, but also show the lifestyle of (our fans and fighters)?\nYou know, we're almost like a traveling circus. We have people who have been in this company for years and years, and we travel together. We, we go to restaurants together. We are searching for the best food the best nightclubs \u2013 stuff like that. So why not show the lifestyle outside of just fighting, because we're so much more. I've hosted shows before, so it just felt like a natural fit to go that way and it's still like within my comfort zone because I'm still around the people that I've worked with for years and years. I'm not catapulting into a brand new company. I still have my security blanket on.\n\n\n\nI had a baby in 2020, and I went back to work, honestly, three months after I had him. I feel like there was so much pressure to like be back to normal and be perfect and fit into my ring girl outfit, and that was all pressure from me, by the way, not from anybody else. But I kind of wish that I would have just taken my time instead of just going right back in, because I feel like I was traveling after he was only 3 months old, and I just wish I I would have slowed down, because now he's 3 years old and he feels like a teenager.\nChandella Powell, Dana White, Arianny Celeste at UFC 120 in London\nI would say the top two was, (for one), Jon Anik. He always says the nicest things about me. He's always calling me the GOAT and he also wants me to walk again \u2013 but again, it's not my choice. Also, Dana called me and he's like, \u2018You know what, babe? You're always going to be in the UFC. Whatever you want, if it goes within the company, of course, I have your back and you'll always be part of the UFC.' So those two really made my day getting love from them. Obviously it's nice.\nBrittney Palmer and Arianny Celeste\nRegrets? No. Honestly, I feel like, especially within the company, I did everything. I never said no to any job or opportunity, and I feel like that really catapulted my career. I got to see so many different places at a very young age. I really don't regret any of it.\nSYDNEY, AUSTRALIA \u2013 FEBRUARY 25: UFC Fighters Stephan Bonnar (L) and Matt Mitrione (2ndR) pose with Octagon Girls (L-R) Chandella Powell, Brittney Palmer and Arianny Celeste at Bondi Beach on February 25, 2011 in Sydney, Australia.

(Photo by Ryan Pierse/Getty Images)\nIf I had to commit to one city that's far away, as long as I have my baby with me, I would live in Sydney for sure. I love the food. I love the weather. I love the beach. The people are really nice and everybody's very health conscious and fit. Everyone's working out. You see people just running on the beach and everyone seems so happy.\nLAS VEGAS, NV \u2013 NOVEMBER 30: UFC Octagon Girl Arianny Celeste holds the Ring Girl of the Year award at the Fighters Only World Mixed Martial Arts Awards 2011 at The Pearl concert theater at the Palms Casino Resort November 30, 2011 in Las Vegas, Nevada. (Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images)\nFrog legs or something. I don't know. Oh, wow. I haven't really ventured out that much with food. I'm very picky with my food. I've never really had a steak. I've had, like, one bite of steak recently because I was doing an episode on a steakhouse. I had my first taste of steak, so that just tells you I'm not real adventurous when it comes to food. I eat fish and some chicken and some meat. I'm more of a texture person. The texture of a steak I'm not really fond of. Back in the day when I was a kid, my parents would take me to carne asada all the time, and I would literally tell them to burn the meat until it was almost like beef jerky.\nArianny Celeste\nI always seem to get sick around my birthday in November, and it's always at MSG. So in New York, I remember I was sick as a dog and I went back and I don't know if it was Craig or Dana who saw me and they're like, \u2018You just need to lay down for a little bit. It's OK. You can take the night off.' So I just kind of rested backstage, but I still did a couple rounds.\nArianny Celeste, UFC 65 (UFC via Getty Images)\nI'm always going to go back to the good old days when there wasn't as many fighters \u2013 the Stephan Bonnar and (Forrest) Griffin fight, that was a classic. And also, when BJ Penn changed weights and won a title and was full of blood and licking his body and I was like, \u2018Wow \u2013 he is a savage.' That was a crazy moment. I miss those old-school crazy fights. They're still crazy fights, but those didn't necessarily make you cry.\nArianny Celeste\nI think it'd be an honor to be a part of the Hall of Fame. Again, talk to the boss and see what he says. That's an honor (that people think I should be in). So hopefully maybe one day.\nDana White, Ronda Rousey\nI never talked to her. I kind of just avoided the whole situation just because I didn't even know her. For me, it was understandable a little bit, though, because she's a fighter. I'm a ring girl at the time. I believe I was the female face of the UFC, and here comes this amazing athlete, but she's like, \u2018Who are you? You're the face of the UFC. No, no, no \u2013 I'm going to be.' So I get it. It's like a competitive thing, but I think the way she handled herself was not cool. If I feel like she's a little bit more aggressive in nature, to each their own. She didn't make me sweat at all. I was perfectly fine. I just ignored the situation. I'm pretty peaceful unless you mess with me. I definitely did call Dana. I was like, \u2018What do I do about this?' and he was able to calm me down because it didn't affect me, but it did bother me. I'm like, \u2018Hey, I don't even know this person. What should I do? Why is she being like this?' After thinking about it letting it fizzle, I kind of got her perspective a little bit more.\n\nBe sure to visit the MMA Junkie Instagram page and YouTube channel to discuss this and more content with fans of mixed martial arts.",

Undefeated South Carolina is still the undisputed No. 1 seed, and the top-heavy Pac-12 still has the most teams projected to host with five teams in the top 16.\nHere's the full seed list from the committee as of Feb. 29:\nLet's take a closer look at the winners and losers with just 17 days to go until Selection Sunday.\nMarch 7, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Gonzaga Bulldogs forward Yvonne Ejim (15) shoots the basketball against the Portland Pilots during the first half in the finals of the WCC Basketball Championships at Orleans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Bulldogs were left outside the top 16 in the last top 16 reveal, but all they've done over the past two weeks is kept winning. And so, the Zags are in the top 16, projected to host games in Spokane, Washington.\nGonzaga has won 23 games in a row, which is the second-longest win streak in the country behind only South Carolina. And Gonzaga isn't winning by just a little bit \u2013 its closest margin of victory since Dec. 10 was a 13-point victory at Pacific on Feb. 17.\nThe Bulldogs are projected to be in a regional with UCLA, Virginia Tech and UConn. While those other three teams are very good, none of them can take Yvonne Ejim and the Zags lightly. Remember: this is a team that has wins over Stanford, a 21-4 Toledo team, South Dakota State, Arizona and Alabama.\nFeb 28, 2024; Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA; Iowa Hawkeyes guard Caitlin Clark (22) looks on during the second half against the Minnesota Golden Gophers at Williams Arena. Mandatory Credit: Matt Krohn-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Hawkeyes dropped two spots in this latest top 16 reveal, likely do their 17-point loss at Indiana on Feb. 22. While two spots isn't a dramatic drop for Caitlin Clark and company, it does put them in a regional with South Carolina.\nAnd sure, Clark and the Hawkeyes pulled off the seemingly impossible last season by handing the Gamecocks their first loss of the season in the Final Four, but Iowa would likely prefer a path to Cleveland, Ohio that doesn't go through Dawn Staley's squad.\nNeither South Carolina nor Iowa will likely be happy seeing each other in a potential Elite Eight matchup in Albany, New York \u2013 but it would be a major win for women's college basketball fans.\n \n \nOklahoma head coach Jennie Baranczyk yells to the referee in the first quarter during an NCAA basketball game between University of Oklahoma (OU) and Baylor University, in Norman Okla., on Wednesday, Feb. 14, 2024.\nOU endured a stretch in non-conference play where they lost five of six games, a span that included a somewhat embarrassing defeat to Southern by nine points. On Dec. 22, Oklahoma simply did not look like an NCAA Tournament team \u2013 forget about hosting games.\nBut since then they've gone 15-2 and just secured their second straight Big 12 title with a 71-70 win over Texas on Wednesday. OU is one of the best rebounding teams in the country, ranking eighth in boards per game with 44.0. They also move the ball incredibly well, ranking first in assisted shot rate with a clip of 70.8%.\nJennie Baranczyk's team is peaking at the right time.\nThere's good news and bad news in this latest reveal for the ACC.\nThe good news is that Virginia Tech took a big leap, moving from 10th overall to fifth. Powered by two-time ACC Player of the Year Elizabeth Kitley and sparkplug guard Georgia Amoore, the Hokies have won 10 straight games, just hosted ESPN's College GameDay, and seem fully capable of winning a second straight ACC title.\nThe bad news for the conference is, while it might get the most teams into the NCAA tournament with eight or nine, it's currently projected to have just two teams hosting.\nLouisville fell out of the top 16, and since losing back-to-back games to rivals Duke and UNC, N.C. State fell from No. 6 to No. 11 in the eyes of the committee. Syracuse is the team that probably has the best chance to be the third ACC team to crack the field. A good showing in the ACC Tournament in Greensboro could go a long way for the Orange.\nIs a two-bid Ivy League possible? Will Maryland's streak of tournament appearances continue?

        "excerpt": "As we approach Super Bowl 58 between the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers, fans attempt to predict the score with simulations.",
        "summary": "With \nSuper Bowl 58\n just around the corner, several \nNFL\n fans are looking for ways to predict the result of the impending game. Several publications have released their simulations for the 2024 Super Bowl between the \nKansas City Chiefs\n and the \nSan Francisco 49ers\n.\nWhile these simulations are supposed to create a realistic outcome, oftentimes, they just become something fun to consider during the week leading up to the big game \u2013 or something to give fans of either team false hope before their dreams get decimated.\nThe most popular form of simulation is through the video game \nMadden\n. Madden is the only simulation-style NFL video game and thus makes it an easily attainable method for conducting such simulations. Here are some of the best from around the internet.\nKC dynasty: \nBack-to-back Super Bowl winners: Chiefs can join legendary champions with Super Bowl 58 win\nSuper Bowl 58 simulations:\nMadden\n:\n Chiefs 30, 49ers 28\nThe official Madden 24 simulation saw the Chiefs take down the 49ers. When the Chiefs and 49ers squared off in 2020, Madden also predicted a Chiefs' victory and was correct. However, neither team is where they were four years ago. Madden's official simulation has not correctly predicted the Super Bowl winner in three straight years.\nCBS Sports\n:\n 49ers 10, Chiefs 6\nThis score would be a shocker given the effectiveness of the 49ers offense as well as the greatness of Patrick Mahomes. Still, with the Chiefs' defense playing as well as it has, a low-scoring affair could very well be on the docket.\nCBS's simulation predicts that a late interception from former Kansas City Chief Charvarius Ward will seal the Chiefs' fate. Ward will win Super Bowl MVP for his performance.\nSports Illustrated\n:\n Chiefs 24, 49ers 21\nSports Illustrated did not use Madden to run their simulations, opting for a computer model to predict the score instead. Luke Lindholm writes that the computer leaned toward the Chiefs because of their performance in recent games compared to the 49ers. Where the 49ers showed flashes of greatness in the second half of their conference championship and divisional round games, the Chiefs have looked dominant throughout the entirety of their games in these playoffs.\nLindholm also notes that the Chiefs have distinct advantages at quarterback and on defense. The 49ers' defense has been exposed up front against elite offenses throughout the year. While they were able to control the Dallas Cowboys, the Detroit Lions and Baltimore Ravens have been able to poke holes in the Niners' front seven.\nHow has Madden done at predicting winners?\nHistorically, Madden has been right more often than it has been wrong, with a record of 11-9 since the official simulations started prior to Super Bowl 38. However, Madden has endured a rough stretch as of late, going 1-5 in the last six Super Bowls. In all fairness, the one game that Madden has correctly predicted in that span was the Chiefs vs. 49ers in 2020.\nPrior to that, Madden's last correct prediction came in Super Bowl 51 between the New England Patriots and Atlanta Falcons. Madden predicted a three-point victory for New England. Crazily enough, Madden has actually predicted the exact score of the Super Bowl before. The video game predicted a 28-24 victory for the Patriots over the Seattle Seahawks, which ended up being the correct score. Madden did not predict the massive interception at the end of the game, but for a simulation to come that close is still a remarkable feat.\nHow to watch Super Bowl 58: date, TV, streaming\nWhen:\n\u00a0Sunday, February 11, 2024\nWhere:\n\u00a0Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, NV\nTime:\n\u00a06:30 p.m. ET/3:30 p.m. PT\nTV:\n\u00a0CBS, Nickelodeon\nStream:\n YouTube TV, \nFubo TV\n, \nParamount+\nStream the game: \nWatch Super Bowl 58 with Fubo\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

        "summary": "NFL free agency is upon us, which means teams around the league are set to welcome some new additions to the roster.\nFor the Chicago Bears, they're getting ready to let the NFL world know of their decision at quarterback. They are either going to keep Justin Fields or move on and select one (likely Caleb Williams) with the first overall pick in the 2024 NFL draft.\nThe expectation is Chicago will trade Fields, but free agency will be key in providing a market for a partner. The Pittsburgh Steelers, a team believed to be itnerested in Fields, are out of the running after recently signing Russell Wilson. Baker Mayfield is back with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, which is great news for the Bears. \nBut all eyes will be on Kirk Cousins, who's garnering plenty of interest from the Atlanta Facons. If Cousins re-signs with the Minnesota Vikings, the Falcons will be a top suitor for Fields.\nFree agency kicks off this week, and it will impact decision-making at the draft as teams address some current needs.\nWith that in mind, here's our current first-round projections as free agency gets underway:\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA \u2013 NOVEMBER 18: Caleb Williams #13 of the USC Trojans passes the ball during the first half of a game against the UCLA Bruins at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on November 18, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

        "summary": "There are many ways in which women's college basketball is different than the men's game. When it comes to the NCAA Tournament, there is one especially glaring difference.\nWhile the men play their entire tournament at neutral sites, the top 16 seeds in the women's field get to host games on the first weekend. Which means, if you have a really good season, you'll get to play your first two tournament games on your home court, making a top 16 seed incredibly valuable and something that teams strive for.\nThis month, the selection committee for the women's NCAA Tournament unveils their top 16 seeds twice, giving a fans a glimpse into what they're thinking, what they value, and where teams would be seeded if the season ended at that moment.\nWe got our first top 16 reveal on Thursday night before Caitlin Clark continued her pursuit of the all-time scoring record. Here's the seed list:\nIf the tournament started today, these would be the top 16 teams in the bracket!#NCAAWBB pic.twitter.com/jPC1c0rwKB\n\u2014 NCAA March Madness (@MarchMadnessWBB) February 15, 2024\n\nWith that, let's take a look at some winners and losers from the reveal.\nDec 30, 2023; Los Angeles, California, USA; USC Trojans guard JuJu Watkins (12) watches a shot in the second half against the UCLA Bruins at Pauley Pavilion presented by Wescom. Mandatory Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\nIt's the last season of the Pac-12 as we know it and the conference is absolutely going out with a bang. It has stars like JuJu Watkins and Alissa Pili, stacked teams like Stanford and UCLA, and squads you can't overlook like Oregon State. Before this league splinters apart, its playing some of its best basketball.\nThe committee is currently forecasting that the Pac-12 will have five teams hosting first weekend games, the most of any conference. Stanford and Colorado are projected to earn No. 1 seeds, UCLA is a 2-seed, and USC and Oregon State are 3-seeds. While some might argue that the ACC is the deepest conference, the Pac-12 is heavy at the top.\nStanford is the highest seeded Pac-12 team and for good reason. The Cardinal are No. 2 overall in NET and are 7-3 against teams in the top 25 of the NET \u2013 which is the most wins any team in the country has against the NET top 25.\nIf you're wondering why Colorado is the team that joined Stanford on the 1-line, it's because the Buffs don't have any bad losses. They've fallen to N.C. State, UCLA and Oregon State, all teams in the top 25 of the NET. The teams right behind the Buffs in the seeding order \u2013 Iowa and N.C. State \u2013 have losses outside of the top 25, to Nebraska and Miami, respectively.\n4-6 should be Iowa, NC State, Colorado otherwise I agree with this https://t.co/8eeFgAvJ7s\n\u2014 Christian Jackson (@cjack67) February 15, 2024\n\nMarch 7, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Gonzaga Bulldogs guard Kaylynne Truong (14) celebrates against the Portland Pilots during the first half in the finals of the WCC Basketball Championships at Orleans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Kyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\nProjections released Thursday morning by The Athletic and HerHoopStats had the Zags hosting first-round games. The Bulldogs' resume is impressive. They are 24-2 and on an 18-game win streak, they own wins over Stanford, South Dakota State and Arizona, and their only losses came on the road in overtime at Washington State, and on a neutral court to Louisville. Gonzaga is 9-0 against teams ranked 51 to 100 in the NET \u2013 which is the best mark of that sort in the country \u2013 and they're 3-2 against teams in the top 50 of the NET.\nSimply put, Gonzaga deserves to host. Again \u2013 this team beat Stanford! By double digits!\nThe Bulldogs are 11th in NET, ninth in HerHoopsStats rating and have been ranked in the AP Top 25 Poll for the majority of the season.\nThat Gonzaga wasn't in the top 16 of this reveal feels like a slight towards mid-majors.\nSome folks will say the Bulldogs need to schedule tougher, but they played against five Power 5 opponents in the non-conference slate and beat three of them. What more can the Zags do?\nZags are currently riding a 18 game winning streak, 24-2 overall, ranked No. 11 in the net, are 4-2 in Quad 1 and 6-0 in Quad 2, and beat one of the No. 1 seeds on there (Stanford) by 20 points.\nBut sure, they aren't one of the top 16 teams in the country https://t.co/I2uXYZ6Csl\n\u2014 Another Gonzaga Blog (@AnotherZagsBlog) February 15, 2024\n\nSouth Carolina head coach Dawn Staley calls out from the bench in the first half an NCAA college basketball game against LSU in Baton Rouge, La., Thursday, Jan. 25, 2024. (AP Photo/Gerald Herbert) ORG XMIT: LAGH\nThe Gamecocks seem to have the No. 1 overall seed on lock. Here's what Lisa Peterson, the chair of the committee, said during the reveal show on ESPN: 'The gap between one and two is very big. The gap between two through five is very small.'\nIn short: South Carolina, right now, looks to be head and shoulders above the rest of the field. And indeed, Dawn Staley's team is the lone undefeated team left in the country.\nThe Gamecocks have played just three games this year where they haven't won by double-digits: Utah, North Carolina and LSU \u2013 each of which was either on the road or on a neutral court.\nEven if South Carolina loses a game or two between now and March 17, it's hard to argue against the Gamecocks being the top seed.\nFeb 7, 2024; Hartford, Connecticut, USA; UConn Huskies head coach Geno Auriemma wins his 1200th game after defeating the Seton Hall Pirates at XL Center. Mandatory Credit: David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\nWomen's basketball fans, I have something to tell you:\nThere is not a scenario in which the committee will send UConn to one of the two Portland regionals. The Huskies could be seeded second, fourth or sixth. It doesn't matter. They are going to Albany.\nAny year that there is a regional based in the northeastern U.S., that is where the Huskies will go. Just ask N.C. State, a No. 1 seed in 2022 that had to face No. 2 UConn in Bridgeport in the Elite Eight.\nThis year, that is going to be true for a few reasons. One, UConn has an incredibly passionate, large and loyal fanbase, and Albany is about two hours and 15 minutes from UConn's campus. The city of Albany and the NCAA are counting on UConn fans to buy tickets, to pack the stands, to stay in hotels, to spend money at restaurants. Secondly, with South Carolina being the No. 1 overall seed in the Albany 1 region, do you really think the committee is going to pass up the opportunity to have the Huskies and Gamecocks meet in the Elite Eight for a rematch? Those TV ratings will break records, and after all, the NCAA Tournament is a television show.\nAs for the folks complaining about Oregon State getting to play in Portland, committee chair Lisa Peterson said as long as a team hasn't played more than three regular season games at a regional site, they can be sent there.\nAlso: take it easy on the Beavers. They're getting left behind in the splintering Pac-12. They deserve a break.\nIDC IDC IDC\u2026UConn should not be in the Albany regional. Oregon St should not be in Portland. Idc what number they are in seeding, but a 3 seed should not have any type of homecourt advantage in the S16 and possibly the E8. pic.twitter.com/76jdXn7YLt\n\u2014 Somewhere between COZY and ALIEN SUPERSTAR!

There was some coaching staff turnover this offseason, plus new faces including QB Tyler Van Dyke entering from the transfer portal. Whether it's just another year of continuity in Fickell and Mike Tressel's defense and Phil Longo's offense, or tangible upgrades in talent on the field, the chance is increasingly likely that 2024 is a better year than 2023.\nRelated: Where Wisconsin QB Tyler Van Dyke falls on Fanduel's 2024 Heisman Trophy odds\nBut Wisconsin's place in the new Big Ten is unknown.

The Hoosiers return a solid chunk of their 2023 production, and face one of the easier conference schedules in the Big Ten.

Every opponent's SP+ rating is added together to find a Total Opponent Score.

That includes the Bears also having the No. 9 overall pick. Who will they take with that selection? That may depend on the decision made at No. 1. \nAs far as other teams go, the headlines will write themselves. Who is going to draft a quarterback? Where is stud Marvin Harrison Jr. going to land?

While Caleb Williams, Drake Maye and Jayden Daniels are expected to go 1-2-3, JJ McCarthy and Bo Nix could also be in the mix to go in the first round.\nWide receiver is also worth monitoring, as we could see three of the draft's top options in Marvin Harrison Jr., Rome Odunze and Malik Nabers go in the top-10.\nThe NFL combine gave teams a chance to see these players up close and formally meet with them. None of the things done at the combine can outweigh things that are done on a football field in games that count, but they could account for tiebreakers if teams are town between a few players. \nWith the NFL combine in the books, here's our updated first-round projections featuring some standouts:\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA \u2013 NOVEMBER 18: Caleb Williams #13 of the USC Trojans passes the ball during the first half of a game against the UCLA Bruins at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on November 18, 2023 in Los Angeles, California.

The team entered as one of the nation's worst shooting teams.\n \nJust nothing will go right now, lol.\nRutgers is No. 350 in the country in 3-point shooting and now they've made 10 3-pointers.#Badgers\n\u2014 Evan Flood (@Evan_Flood) February 10, 2024\n\nRutgers is BOTTOM 15 NATIONALLY in 3pt%.. 352nd in the country!!\nThey're 9 for 16 today.. 56.3%\n\u2014 \u15e9\u144eT \u15ef\u1587IG\u157cT (@itsAntWright) February 10, 2024\n\nAs many people say, that's just basketball.\n \nFeb 10, 2024; Piscataway, New Jersey, USA; Wisconsin Badgers head coach Greg Gard reacts during the second half against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights at Jersey Mike's Arena. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\nThe most alarming part of the performance began at the opening tip. Rutgers brought full-court pressure immediately, and Wisconsin quickly became unable to advance the ball up the court.\nHas Wisconsin ever seen a press before?\n\u2014 Ben Kenney (@benzkenney) February 10, 2024\n\nNow, hyperbolizing on \u2018X' in this manner has many pointing out that the team obviously practices beating a press. I don't doubt that fact at all.\nBut that's how bad it looked at times on Saturday with sloppy dribbling, ill-advised passes, back-court violations and more. It looked like Rutgers found some schematic approach that Wisconsin didn't know how to defeat.\nFeb 10, 2024; Piscataway, New Jersey, USA; Rutgers Scarlet Knights center Clifford Omoruyi (11) dunks the ball against Wisconsin Badgers forward Steven Crowl (22) and forward Tyler Wahl (5) during the second half at Jersey Mike's Arena. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\nThis is the part of the matchup we should've seen coming.\nJersey Mike's Arena is a notoriously challenging place to play. Although this Rutgers team isn't that good, it is 10-3 at home and only 3-5 on the road. Being in attendance yesterday I could see why.\nThe atmosphere was electric for it being an early afternoon game. The Scarlet Knights clearly fed off that energy \u2014 something the Badgers were never able to match.\n \nFeb 10, 2024; Piscataway, New Jersey, USA; Wisconsin Badgers head coach Greg Gard bumps fists with forward Tyler Wahl (5) during the first half against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights at Jersey Mike's Arena. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\nThere can't be much second-guessing of the head coach when the opponent shoots nearly 60% from three and runs away with a decisive victory. Much of that was Rutgers came to play yesterday, and Wisconsin didn't\nBut there is one decision by Gard I'd second-guess: immediately benching Max Klesmit after he picked up his second foul with 13:31 left in the first half.\nI understand the approach, that Klesmit is more valuable on the court in crunch time than he would be if he fouled out.\nBut this thinking forgets the context of the situation: Wisconsin backup point guard Kamari McGee remains out with an injury, as does impressive freshman guard John Blackwell. So the Badgers' guard rotation is shallow, as Gard was forced to go to Connor Essegian for 24 minutes and Isaac Lindsey for eight.\nThis means not only is Klesmit's ball-handling ability and veteran presence on the bench, but also the usual replacements aren't available. That discrepancy was seen as Wisconsin tried to break Rutgers' pressure, generate consistent offense and take the energy out of a hectic arena.\nPlus, this thinking assumes Wisconsin would even get to crunch time still in arm's distance. Instead, the Badgers trailed by 15-20 for the entire second half and never put a run together. Earlier first-half minutes for Klesmit may have evened the playing field at least a bit.\nMADISON, WISCONSIN \u2013 MARCH 14: Connor Essegian #3 of the Wisconsin Badgers reacts after a made three point shot by Steven Crowl during the first half of the game at Kohl Center on March 14, 2023 in Madison, Wisconsin. (Photo by John Fisher/Getty Images)\nIn what has been a rocky sophomore season for Connor Essegian, he was a clear bright spot during yesterday's loss.\nThe young guard played 24 minutes off the bench and led the team with 15 points.\nWith Chucky Hepburn unable to find his shot, Tyler Wahl and Steven Crowl struggling to score on the inside and A.J. Storr's poor shooting, Essegian's scoring spark was the only thing keeping the Badgers competitive early in the second half.\nMar 28, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Wisconsin Badgers guard Chucky Hepburn (23) passes the ball against the North Texas Mean Green in the first half at Orleans Arena. Mandatory Credit: Candice Ward-USA TODAY Sports\nI wrote this after Wisconsin's tight loss to Purdue last Sunday, and it still applies:\nChucky Hepburn has been a valuable part of the Badgers' team all season, even though he averages just over seven points per game.\nOn Sunday he finished with six points \u2014 all in garbage time.\nThese are the games Hepburn needs to match the opposing point guard and contribute offensively. On Sunday, there seemed to be way too much passivity as opportunities for shots were passed up.\nIt's fine to say that Hepburn needs to do more on offense.\nThis was the case yet again at Rutgers. Midway through the second half as the Badgers trailed by 15 points and were barely in the game, Hepburn had attempted only one shot.\nI'm no advocate of forcing bad shots or straying from the normal offense. But the Badgers weren't getting good looks all afternoon, and it felt like a situation where a veteran point guard should take over and at least generate some offense.\nWisconsin's losing skid can't be righted until the point guard returns to scoring the basketball.\nFeb 10, 2024; Piscataway, New Jersey, USA; Wisconsin Badgers guard Max Klesmit (11) shoots the ball against Rutgers Scarlet Knights center Clifford Omoruyi (11) during the second half at Jersey Mike's Arena. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\nAfter the loss to Purdue, many looked ahead to games against last-place Michigan and 12-10 Rutgers as get-right opportunities for this Wisconsin team.\nWell, here we are and the Badgers lost both. Given the state of their play and last week of results, the team could lose to anybody and it wouldn't be a surprise.\nComing up are winnable games vs Ohio State, at Iowa, vs Maryland and at Indiana. Now, those games seem just as losable as they are winnable.\nAfter that is a mini-gauntlet to close the season. Home against No. 10 Illinois, home against Rutgers and at No. 2 Purdue.\nThis four-game skid must be snapped immediately. But the Badgers then still must quickly improve to avoid this promising season slipping away.",

        "summary": "The 2024 NFL Scouting Combine is getting underway in Indianapolis, where general managers, coaches and staff will get a chance to see some of the NFL draft's top prospects in action and inside the meeting room.\nRyan Poles and the Chicago Bears are on the clock. For the second year in a row, Chicago has the first overall pick, courtesy of the Carolina Panthers in a trade of the top selection last year (where they also got DJ Moore, Darnell Wright, Tyrique Stevenson and a 2025 second rounder). The Panthers selected Alabama quarterback Bryce Young.\nAlthough hindsight tells us that this is one of the greatest trades in NFL history, Poles' tenure as Bears GM rides on making the right decision this year. Will he trade the top pick in favor of keeping Justin Fields or stay put and select a rookie, most likely Caleb Williams?\nThat's the top storyline heading into the combine, where Poles' phone has already been ringing off the hook as teams try to gauge the temperature of which direction Chicago is leaning. There has been interest both in trading for the No. 1 pick and trading for Fields, so the Bears are worth monitoring this week as things could happen quickly on the Fields front.\nThat is the top story and it will lead off a wonderful first round. But all 32 teams are going to try and get better this offseason, and the combine will serve as a big opportunity for them to get to know these prospects with the draft just a couple of months out. \nSo before the combine action kicks off with on-field workouts on Thursday, here are first-round projections in our latest mock draft:\n\nOct 7, 2023; Los Angeles, California, USA; Southern California Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams (13) throws against the Arizona Wildcats during the first half at Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

Then, they look to free agency to find someone to throw him the ball. Russell Wilson makes a lot of sense there. \n\nGeorgia tight end Brock Bowers (19) scores a touchdown during the second half of a NCAA college football game against Ole Miss in Athens, Ga., on Saturday, Nov. 11, 2023.

Mandatory Credit: Mark J. Rebilas-USA TODAY Sports\nLike the Ravens, the San Francisco 49ers are very close to having a perfect roster. They are even closer because they don't pay their QB much. In the draft, taking a chance on a good offensive tackle might be the best route for them to take so they go with Jordan Morgan out of Arizona. \n\nSep 10, 2022; Seattle, Washington, USA; Portland State Vikings quarterback Dante Chachere (15) looks to pass as he is pressured by Washington Huskies defensive lineman Bralen Trice (8) during the first half at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium.

        "summary": "Wisconsin basketball's season to remember is quickly becoming one to forget.\nThe program entered the 2024 calendar year with loads of momentum. It then entered February as one of the best teams in the country \u2014 ranked No. 6 in the nation in the AP Poll, leading the Big Ten Conference race and sitting as a borderline 1-seed in most bracketologies.\nBadgers fans had Final Four expectations at that moment in time. Comparisons were being drawn to Bo Ryan's 2014-2015 team, as it was thought a National Championship was a realistic option.\n: \nWell, things fell off rather quickly in February. Nevertheless, Wisconsin still enters the final games of its regular season and the Big Ten Tournament with a chance to get hot before the NCAA Tournament. The Badgers won't be a top seed in the big dance, but they are a lock to make it.\nAs we've seen in the past, anything can happen at that stage in the season.\nBefore those final regular season games happen, here is where the Badgers stand in the updated NCAA basketball national championship odds, as of Sunday morning after their loss vs Illinois:\n\nFeb 6, 2024; Hartford, Connecticut, USA; UConn Huskies head coach Dan Hurley, guard Cam Spencer (12) and guard Tristen Newton (2) celebrate after defeating the Butler Bulldogs in the second half at XL Center.

        "excerpt": "A blockbuster trade at the top of the board highlights this 2024 NFL mock draft",
        "summary": "The NFL draft is the place where one right move or wrong move can make or break a franchise for years to come. But it's also a place where teams take risks in hopes of landing that franchise-altering player that changes things for the better. \nWe're going to explore such a risk in this 2024 NFL mock draft, which includes a blockbuster trade at the top of the draft board. There has been plenty of speculation about a possible trade involving the top-three picks with three potential franchise quarterbacks up for grabs early. \nCaleb Williams, Drake Maye and Jayden Daniels are all high-end prospects that could get dangled like carrots to quarterback-needy teams aiming to trade up. \nThe Chicago Bears, Washington Commanders and New England Patriots are the top-three teams on the draft board, and each could use a significant upgrade at the quarterback position. Are they content enough to just let the process play out, or would the Commanders or Patriots be bold enough to trade up to ensure they get the quarterback of their choosing? \nHere's how things turned out in this week's mock draft: \n\n\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA \u2013 NOVEMBER 18: Caleb Williams #13 of the USC Trojans leaves the field unable to convert a fourth down during the second half of a game against the UCLA Bruins at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on November 18, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\nThe Washington Commanders complete the dream story by trading up and selecting the hometown quarterback, Caleb Williams, at No. 1 overall. This move ended up costing them two first-round draft picks and a third-rounder. But they ultimately land their quarterback of the future with the arm talent to potentially turn the entire franchise around. \n\nNov 11, 2023; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA; LSU Tigers quarterback Jayden Daniels (5) looks to pass against the Florida Gators during the second half at Tiger Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports\nSure, the Bears would have loved to draft Caleb Williams. Who wouldn't? But they still make out well in the trade with the Commanders. They got two extra draft picks for only moving back one spot on the board. With Williams off the board, they take a shot on Heisman Trophy winner Jayden Daniels. \n\nPITTSBURGH, PENNSYLVANIA \u2013 SEPTEMBER 23: Drake Maye #10 of the North Carolina Tar Heels celebrates after a North Carolina Tar Heels touchdown in the first quarter against the Pittsburgh Panthers at Acrisure Stadium on September 23, 2023 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. (Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images)\nThe quarterback-needy Patriots take the last of the top-three signal-callers left on the draft board. There's no need for the front office in New England to complicate things. Get a new quarterback to match the new head coach. \n\nNov 18, 2023; Columbus, Ohio, USA; Ohio State Buckeyes wide receiver Marvin Harrison Jr. (18) checks in as an eligible receiver during the NCAA football game against the Minnesota Golden Gophers at Ohio Stadium.\nThe Cardinals could use help on defense, but they also need weapons for quarterback Kyler Murray at wide receiver. Marvin Harrison Jr. is the best available player on the board, and they make the right decision by selecting him at No. 4 overall. \n\nSOUTH BEND, INDIANA \u2013 APRIL 22: Joe Alt #76 of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish looks on during the Notre Dame Blue-Gold Spring Football Game at Notre Dame Stadium on April 22, 2023 in South Bend, Indiana. (Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images)\nKeeping Justin Herbert healthy should be a priority for the Chargers. They can have all of the receiving talent in the world, but if they can't keep their quarterback upright, there's no hope of competing for a Super Bowl. \n\nNov 18, 2023; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA; LSU Tigers wide receiver Malik Nabers (8) celebrates his 40-yard touchdown catch in the fourth quarter against the Georgia State Panthers at Tiger Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Matthew Dobbins-USA TODAY Sports\nIt doesn't matter if it's Daniel Jones or another quarterback, the Giants desperately need more offensive weapons. They'd love for Marvin Harrison Jr. to fall to No. 6 overall, but there's a better chance of an ice cream cone surviving a volcano. If not Harrison, LSU's Malik Nabers would be the next logical choice for the Giants. \n\nNov 4, 2023; College Park, Maryland, USA; Penn State Nittany Lions offensive lineman Olumuyiwa Fashanu (74) stands on the sidelines during the first half against the Maryland Terrapins at SECU Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Titans do their second-year quarterback Will Levis a major favor by taking one of the top-two tackles in the draft. Olu Fashanu could be a force as a blindside protector in Tennessee for years to come. \n\nPASADENA, CALIFORNIA \u2013 JANUARY 01: Dallas Turner #15 of the Alabama Crimson Tide celebrates in the first quarter against the Michigan Wolverines during the CFP Semifinal Rose Bowl Game at Rose Bowl Stadium on January 01, 2024 in Pasadena, California. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\nThe Falcons resist the urge of trading up in the draft and sign a veteran quarterback in free agency. That allows them to address another area of need on the defensive front. Dallas Turner is a game-wrecker capable of making a major impact right out of the gates. \n\nNov 18, 2023; Corvallis, Oregon, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) celebrates a touchdown during the second quarter against the Oregon State Beavers at Reser Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Craig Strobeck-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Bears get a No. 1 receiver to go with their new quarterback. Rome Odunze is an explosive playmaker that would serve as a significant upgrade for Chicago's skilled positions. For a franchise with a long history of focusing on the defensive side of the ball, it's about time they get the offense right. \n\nGeorgia tight end Brock Bowers (19) celebrates after scoring a touchdown during the first half of a NCAA college football game against UAB in Athens, Ga., on Saturday, Sept. 23, 2023.\nWe're working off the assumption that the Jets make offensive line upgrades in free agency. That enables them to go after one of the best offensive playmakers in the entire draft. Imagine an offense with legendary quarterback Aaron Rodgers throwing to Garrett Wilson and Georgia's Brock Bowers. The Jets would go from pretenders to contenders overnight. \n\nOct 21, 2023; Stanford, California, USA; UCLA Bruins defensive lineman Laiatu Latu (15) after defeating the Stanford Cardinal at Stanford Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\nDanielle Hunter could be on the way out the door for the Vikings. So they fill that potential hole with a younger, cheaper option in UCLA's Laiatu Latu. Outside of finding a quarterback, improving on defense should be at the top of Minnesota's to-do list. \n\nNov 25, 2023; Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA; Michigan Wolverines quarterback J.J. McCarthy (9) rolls out to pass in the first half against the Ohio State Buckeyes at Michigan Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Broncos didn't even have to trade up to get their quarterback of the future. They stay put at No. 12 and take the plunge on former Michigan quarterback J.J. McCarthy. After moving on from Russell Wilson, it's time for the Broncos and coach Sean Payton to kick-start a new era in Denver. \n\nNov 18, 2023; Corvallis, Oregon, USA; Oregon State Beavers head coach Jonathan Smith greets offensive lineman Taliese Fuaga (75) during senior ceremonies pregame against the Washington Huskies at Reser Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Craig Strobeck-USA TODAY Sports\nInstead of reaching on a quarterback early in the first round, the Raiders make the decision to fortify their offense front. Taliese Fuaga is the Swiss army knife of offensive linemen in the draft. He's versatile enough to line up anywhere on the offensive front and help fortify a unit that has been an accident waiting to happen for the Raiders. \n\nFAYETTEVILLE, ARKANSAS \u2013 OCTOBER 01: J.C. Latham #65 of the Alabama Crimson Tide celebrates on the sidelines in the second half during a game against the Arkansas Razorbacks at Donald W. Reynolds Razorback Stadium on October 01, 2022 in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The Crimson Tide defeated the Razorbacks 49-26. (Photo by Wesley Hitt/Getty Images)\nThe first order of business for the Saints should be keeping quarterback Derek Carr's jersey clean. There were protection issues throughout the 2023 season, and it hurt the overall quality of the offense. Drafting J.C. Latham could be one of the first moves towards cleaning up the mess. \n\nAUBURN, ALABAMA \u2013 NOVEMBER 25: Terrion Arnold #3 of the Alabama Crimson Tide reacts after intercepting the final pass of the game in their 27-24 win over the Auburn Tigers at Jordan-Hare Stadium on November 25, 2023 in Auburn, Alabama. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\nTerrion Arnold was a headache to deal with for opposing SEC offenses. In this mock draft, AFC South teams in the NFL better keep some Tylenol handy with the former Alabama standout being drafted in the first round by the Colts. This moves helps Indy get younger in the defensive backfield, while also helping them combat a tough division featuring the likes of Trevor Lawrence and C.J. Stroud. \n\nNov 11, 2023; Tallahassee, Florida, USA; Florida State Seminoles defensive end Jared Verse (5) before the game against the Miami Hurricanes at Doak S. Campbell Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Melina Myers-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Seahawks get more disruptive along the defensive front by taking former Florida State pass-rusher Jared Verse. It has been a while since the Seahawks were feared defensively, but Verse is the kind of playmaker capable of invoking nostalgia back into the unit. \n\nNov 25, 2023; Baton Rouge, Louisiana, USA; LSU Tigers wide receiver Brian Thomas Jr. (11) catches a touchdown against Texas A&M Aggies defensive back Sam McCall (16) during the second half at Tiger Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stephen Lew-USA TODAY Sports\nJacksonville could be on the verge of losing Calvin Ridley in free agency, which would create a massive hole at receiver. Brian Thomas Jr. has the size and speed to fill the freak playmaker role for the Jaguars' offense. \n\nTexas Longhorns wide receiver Adonai Mitchell (5) reacts to a touchdown during the game against Texas Tech at Darrell K Royal Texas Memorial Stadium on Friday, Nov. 24, 2023.\nThere are no certainties that Tee Higgins won't be traded, even after being franchise tagged. Drafting Texas' Adonai Mitchell allows the Bengals to feel more comfortable moving on from Higgins and going with the younger, cheaper option for the next several years. Joe Burrow needs offensive weapons, and Mitchell could be a major one for Cincy. \n\nDec 2, 2023; Detroit, MI, USA; Toledo Rockets cornerback Quinyon Mitchell (27) breaks up a pass intended for Miami (OH) Redhawks wide receiver Gage Larvadain (10) in the third quarter at Ford Field. Mandatory Credit: Lon Horwedel-USA TODAY Sports\nToledo's Quinyon Mitchell is the choice for the Rams in the first round. They'll be getting a feisty contender that's seemingly always in the right place to make plays. That's what happens when players compete with the sort of motor Mitchell has on the field. \n\nATHENS, GEORGIA \u2013 NOVEMBER 11: Amarius Mims #65 of the Georgia Bulldogs reacts following the 52-17 victory over the DATA: # of the Mississippi Rebels at Sanford Stadium on November 11, 2023 in Athens, Georgia. (Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images)\nThe Steelers move to strengthen their offensive front by taking Georgia offensive tackle Amarius Mims. It's the most logical pick, even if it isn't the most exciting one for Steelers fans that watched the team take an offensive tackle in the first round in 2023 as well. \n\nNov 18, 2023; Tempe, Arizona, USA; Oregon Ducks offensive lineman Jackson Powers-Johnson (58) against the Arizona State Sun Devils at Mountain America Stadium.

They manage to address that need right out of the gates by taking Oregon center Jackson Powers-Johnson in the first round. \n\nNov 25, 2023; Columbia, South Carolina, USA; Clemson Tigers cornerback Nate Wiggins (2) smiles after breaking up a pass to South Carolina wide receiver Nyck Harbor (8) during the fourth quarter at Williams-Brice Stadium. Clemson won 16-7. Mandatory Credit: Ken Ruinard-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Eagles' passing defense was an absolute disaster last season. They need to improve in the defensive backfield to help take some of the pressure off their offense to always have to respond with points. A good start to doing that would be drafting a defensive ball-hawk with a high ceiling like Clemson's Nate Wiggins. \n\nJan 1, 2024; New Orleans, LA, USA; Texas Longhorns defensive lineman Byron Murphy II (90) celebrates after a play during the second quarter in the 2024 Sugar Bowl college football playoff semifinal game at Caesars Superdome. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Texans went from rags to riches on the offensive side of the ball last season after drafting C.J. Stroud at No. 2 overall. Some would say the same about Houston's defense after drafting Will Anderson. Now, imagine a devastating playmaker like Texas defensive tackle Byron Murphy II being added to the mix. \n\nDec 1, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Washington Huskies offensive lineman Troy Fautanu (55) celebrates after the Huskies scored against the Oregon Ducks during the first quarter at Allegiant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Stephen R. Sylvanie-USA TODAY Sports\nThe Cowboys could lose Tyron Smith in free agency, and they're clearly looking to get younger and cheaper along the offensive front. Washington's Troy Fautanu fits the mold of an athletic linebacker strong and agile enough to hold up in pass protection consistently. \n\nOct 28, 2023; Lawrence, Kansas, USA; Oklahoma Sooners offensive lineman Tyler Guyton (60) at the line of scrimmage against the Kansas Jayhawks during the game at David Booth Kansas Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\nAfter picking a defensive player in the first round last year, the Packers shift their focus back towards keeping their quarterback, Jordan Love, from getting folded like a lawn chair in the pocket. Oklahoma tackle Tyler Guyton is the right man for the job of keeping Love upright. The more time he has to throw, the better for the Packers. \n\nOct 14, 2023; Universit",

        "summary": "A new era of Big Ten football begins this fall with four powerful brands joining the conference. No more Big Ten East and West divisions and no more Midwest-centric geography. Now the Big Ten reaches coast-to-coast and contains some of the biggest brands in the sport.\nWhat this means for business has been discussed at length. What it means for competition within the conference is clear: the inventory of great games is expanding significantly, which also means tougher paths for nearly every member team.\nRelated: \nA good sample: Oregon joins the Big Ten as one of the top three teams from the onset \u2014 especially given its recruiting pedigree and recent performance under head coach Dan Lanning. The Ducks' first year in the conference includes contests against UCLA, Michigan State, Ohio State, Michigan, Wisconsin and Washington. That is a tough path regardless of the program's strength.\nRelated: \nSo as we prepare to see the new era of Big Ten football \u2014 and especially where the Wisconsin, Iowa and Nebraska-type programs fall \u2014 here are our way-too-early record predictions for every team in the conference:\nSep 2, 2023; Bloomington, Indiana, USA; Indiana Hoosiers quarterback Brendan Sorsby (15) scrambles during the second half of the NCAA football game against the Ohio State Buckeyes at Indiana University Memorial Stadium.

        "summary": "The 2023 football season concluded this month and with it, so did the conference structure we've known for the last decade. Gone are the East and West divisions, and in come UCLA, USC, Washington and Oregon.\nThe structure of the conference is advancing like the landscape of college football \u2014 into an environment nobody can accurately predict.\nWhat we do know is the Big Ten is now an 18-school conference with several football powerhouses on the way in. If it was already tough for Wisconsin, Iowa, Nebraska and Maryland to win conference titles, it just got nearly impossible.\nRelated: \nSo as we look forward to 2024 and the next 10 years of Big Ten football, it's time to properly rank every program:\nNov 4, 2023; Chicago, Illinois, USA; Northwestern Wildcats head coach David Braun looks on during the first half against the Iowa Hawkeyes at Wrigley Field. Mandatory Credit: David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 8-5\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 52\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 101\n \nThen-interim head coach David Braun took Northwestern to an 8-5 record in 2023. It was the most impressive coaching job in the Big Ten this season, and maybe even in the nation.\nUnfortunately, the long-term outlook isn't especially bright. The program will no longer benefit from the Big Ten West, it will be the second-most-talented team on the field in every game and its general recruiting issues should only be accentuated by the current direction of the sport.\nNorthwestern went a combined 4-20 in the two years leading up to 2023. I'd expect that to be more in line with the future record.\nNov 4, 2023; Bloomington, Indiana, USA; Indiana's JoJo Johnson (3) and Nick James (99) celebrate after defeating the Wisconsin Badgers at Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rich Janzaruk-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 3-9\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 47\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 60\n \nIndiana is a bit more talented than Northwestern, but the same issues are present. The program is in a transition period after firing long-time head coach Tom Allen, and while the elimination of divisions won't hurt the program, it is firmly entrenched as one of the worst programs in the conference.\nThe beacon of hope is whether former James Madison head coach Curt Cignetti can replicate what he did at his former job. If so, Indiana could reach its ceiling of being a pesky middle-of-the-road team in the conference.\nSep 3, 2023; Piscataway, New Jersey, USA; Rutgers Scarlet Knights head coach Greg Schiano before the game against the Northwestern Wildcats at SHI Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 7-6\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 61\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 37\n \nBelieve it or not, Rutgers actually has some momentum under Greg Schiano off a 7-6 2023 campaign. The team's 2023 position was clear: better than the bad teams in the conference but clearly worse than the good teams \u2014 which feels like where the best Rutgers teams should lie.\nSchiano has a top-40 2024 class, so maybe Rutgers is serious about staying out of the basement in the new era of the Big Ten.\nPurdue Boilermakers head coach Ryan Walters leads the Boilermakers onto the field during the NCAA football game against the Fresno State Bulldogs, Saturday, Sept. 2, 2023, at Ross-Ade Stadium in West Lafayette, Ind.\n2023 Record: 4-8\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 48\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 30\n \nA few things are true about the last few years of Purdue football. First, Jeff Brohm is a criminally underrated coach who may have had the program at its peak. Second, the program likely isn't as bad as a 4-8 first season under Ryan Walters shows.\nThe good news: Walters does have a top-30 class entering as he works to rework the roster. The bad: top edge rusher Nic Scourton transferred out this offseason, which may unfortunately become the norm for programs on this tier.\nAlso, the elimination of the Big Ten West will hurt big-time. Copy and paste that into every blurb.\nOct 21, 2023; Iowa City, Iowa, USA; Minnesota Golden Gophers head coach P.J. Fleck watches a replay against the Iowa Hawkeyes during the first quarter at Kinnick Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jeffrey Becker-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 6-7\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 57\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 36\n \nMinnesota's 11-2 2019 season feels like a thing of the past for the program. Even good seasons in 2021 and 2022 always had the backbreaking loss that kept the program from winning the West. Now with the West gone and an average talent roster and average recruiting, Minnesota feels a big stuck in the second-to-bottom tier of the conference.\nCHAMPAIGN, ILLINOIS \u2013 OCTOBER 21: Head coach Bret Bielema of the Illinois Fighting Illini protests a call during the second half against the Wisconsin Badgers at Memorial Stadium on October 21, 2023 in Champaign, Illinois. (Photo by Michael Hickey/Getty Images)\n2023 Record: 5-7\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 63\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 45\n \nThese days, a program is often only as good as the person in charge. While 2023 wasn't great, I still believe in Bret Bielema's long history of winning in the conference. Will Illinois contend for conference titles? No way. But Bielema can lift the group up into the Wisconsin/Nebraska tier if all goes well.\nOct 28, 2023; Evanston, Illinois, USA; Maryland Terrapins head coach Mike Locksley (center) on the sidelines during the second half at Ryan Field. Mandatory Credit: David Banks-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 8-5\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 42\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 39\n \nNo program will benefit from the elimination of divisions as much as Maryland. The Terps seemed to always beat up the Rutgers and Indianas of the world while losing in blowout fashion to Penn State, Ohio State and Michigan. Now it can continue that trend but at least avoid having to play the top three programs every season.\nMaryland will always be a sneaky-talented team capable of putting it all together for a 10 or 11-win season.\nNov 25, 2023; Pasadena, California, USA; UCLA Bruins head coach Chip Kelly watches from the sidelines in the fourth quarter against the California Golden Bears at Rose Bowl. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 8-5\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 24\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 82\n \nThe big question with Chip Kelly's UCLA and Lincoln Riley's USC programs is how they will adjust to the style and weather of the Big Ten. For Kelly, at least his team finished 2023 with the nation's top rush defense and No. 10 overall defense.\nOffensively, somehow under Kelly, is the question. Star freshman QB Dante Moore transferred to Oregon this offseason as the Bruins continue to search for a Dorian Thompson-Robinson replacement.\nI think UCLA will enter the Big Ten on the same general tier as Michigan State, Iowa and Wisconsin \u2014 good enough for a peak year or two but always around the middle of the standings.\nOct 14, 2023; Madison, Wisconsin, USA; Iowa Hawkeyes head coach Kirk Ferentz looks on during warmups prior to the game against the Wisconsin Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jeff Hanisch-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 10-4\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 41\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 31\n \nI admire Iowa's dedication to its brand and approach despite (relative) struggles and an evolving sport. I can't say it's struggled if the program hasn't had a losing season since 2012. But anybody who watched the Big Ten Championship could see where the team is deficient (offense).\nGone now is Brian Ferentz, with a new OC yet to be named. The unit will improve because it's impossible to play any worse \u2014 how much it will improve is the question. But guarantee me the same exceptional defense and special teams and I'll bet on Iowa to finish around 8-4 every season.\nMichigan State's Tyrell Henry, right, catches a touchdown as Central Michigan's De'lavion Stepney defends during the fourth quarter on Friday, Sept. 1, 2023, at Spartan Stadium in East Lansing.\n2023 Record: 4-8\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 27\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 47\n \nI had Michigan State down at No. 11 before the coaching carousel concluded. The hire of Jonathan Smith changes things for the better in my eyes, especially if transfer QB Aidan Chiles hits and is a game-changer for years to come.\nThe Spartans still need a consistent rebound, more consistent than Mel Tucker's one year of success, before anybody takes the program seriously. But Smith is a great hire and should at least raise the baseline.\nNov 11, 2023; Lincoln, Nebraska, USA; Nebraska Cornhuskers head coach Matt Rhule during the third quarter against the Maryland Terrapins at Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Dylan Widger-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 5-7\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 21\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 18\n \nThis is a ranking based on Matt Rhule's reputation and Nebraska's powerhouse ability, not on the recent track record of the program. Rhule at Temple (2-10, 6-6, 10-4) and at Baylor (1-11, 7-6, 11-3) traditionally struggles in year one before building to a crescendo in year three. I expect the same kind of progression entering 2024.\nDon't look now, but the Cornhuskers have the No. 18 class of 2024 group and are trending in the talent composite. Rhule has things moving there after only a year.\nMADISON, WISCONSIN \u2013 NOVEMBER 18: Luke Fickell head coach of the Wisconsin Badgers claps after a touchdown during the second quarter against the Nebraska Cornhuskers at Camp Randall Stadium on November 18, 2023 in Madison, Wisconsin. (Photo by John Fisher/Getty Images)\n2023 Record: 7-6\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 30\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 22\n \nThis may be unpopular, but this ranking is more about the excellence of the programs at the top of the conference than about where Wisconsin stands.\nThe Badgers and Nebraska may occupy the same spot in the conference: good enough to battle week-in and week-out, but only good for one or two peak years each decade.\nThe elimination of the Big Ten West hurts the general cause. And while I believe in Luke Fickell as a really good coach, the jury is still out on whether his vision will work \u2014 specifically his hire of Phil Longo at offensive coordinator.\nMar 1, 2022; Los Angeles, California, USA; USC football head coach Lincoln Riley attends the USC Trojans and the Arizona Wildcats men's basketball game at Galen Center. The Wildcats won 91-71. Mandatory Credit: Kiyoshi Mio-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 8-5\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 8\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 17\n \nUSC has played horrid defense since Lincoln Riley arrived in 2022. But USC is still USC and talent is still talent. Riley is arguably the best offensive head coach in the nation, always has one of the nation's best quarterbacks and has the pockets to recruit with the top programs in the nation.\nRiley also fired former defensive coordinator Alex Grinch in mid-November and is at least showing a desire to fix that side of the ball.\nWho knows what the transition to the Big Ten looks like, but don't discount the Trojans just because of the last few years on defense.\nDec 1, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Washington Huskies head coach Kalen DeBoer celebrates after victory over the Oregon Ducks in the Pac-12 Championship game at Allegiant Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 14-1\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 26\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 42\n \nThis is one program I think will slide from its spot at No. 5, but this ranking is necessary after reaching the National Championship in 2023 and showing a long history of winning prior.\nThe biggest question is how Jedd Fisch does after Kalen DeBoer's departure to Alabama. I think the program can continue to win at a high level, but whether it contends for conference titles is the bigger question.\nPenn State head football coach James Franklin yells from the sideline during the second half of an NCAA football game against Michigan at Beaver Stadium Saturday, Nov. 11, 2023, in State College, Pa.\n2023 Record: 10-3\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 13\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 14\n \nPenn State fans are furious about the program's current spot in the conference, while most of the rest of the country would love to be Penn State \u2014 I think that's the best way to describe where the program stands. Domination against everybody not named Michigan and Ohio State, then continued losses against the top two.\nDespite 2023's losses to the two big programs, I'm actually quite bullish on Penn State's place in the new Big Ten. It will be one of the 3-4 most talented teams in the conference and now isn't hurt by playing in the East every year. Don't be surprised if the Nittany Lions are perennial 12-team playoff participants.\nNov 11, 2023; University Park, Pennsylvania, USA; Michigan Wolverines offensive line coach Sherrone Moore reacts while being interviewed with running back Blake Corum (2) following a game against the Penn State Nittany Lions at Beaver Stadium. Michigan won 24-15. Mandatory Credit: Matthew O'Haren-USA TODAY Sports\n2023 Record: 15-0\n2023 Team Talent Composite: No. 14\n2024 Recruiting Class Ranking: No. 16\n \nYes, a team that is fresh off three straight conference titles and a 15-0 National Championship season is down to No. 3 in the future power rankings.\nWhy? Program turnover.\nJim Harbaugh is off to the NFL and with him went several of Michigan's top assistants. Sherrone Moore may prove to be a great coach, but he has to navigate coaching turnover at important spots while developing a roster that lost nearly every contributor from the championship-winning team.\nIn short: Moore will need to build the program more than many expect \u2014 even though he was an internal promotion. For that reason, the Wolverines' long-term outlook falls short of two other programs in the conference.\nMADISON, WISCONSIN \u2013 OCTOBER 28: Ryan Day head coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes reacts to a penalty during the second quarter against the Wisconsin Badgers at Camp Randall Stadium on October 28, 2023 in Madison, Wisconsin.

Yes, the program was a field goal away from winning the National Championship in 2022. But if you listen to Ohio State fans it sounds like the program is in shambles.\nHere's what we know: It remains a top-3 talent team in the nation and top-3 recruiting team, and Michigan's head coach just left for the NFL. The Buckeyes should enter the season either favored, or second behind our No. 1 team.\nSep 30, 2023; Stanford, California, USA; Oregon Ducks head coach Dan Lanning walks on the field before the game against the Stanford Cardinal at Stanford Stadium.

Lanning had the Ducks in position to contend for last year's national championship but fell a bounce short twice to a magical Washington team.\nThis ranking is a combination of current results and future projection. None are better positioned than Oregon.",

        "summary": "The Chicago Bears have finally made their quarterback decision, trading Justin Fields to the Pittsburgh Steelers and electing to start over with a rookie. It's a move that doesn't come as a surprise, and neither should the Bears' direction in the 2024 NFL draft, where they're expected to select Caleb Williams with the first overall pick.\nWith Williams all but a lock at No. 1, the focus shifts to what Chicago will do with their second top-10 selection. Following free agency, there are still needs along the defensive line \u2014 especially at edge rusher, where there will be options on the board. The Bears could also go best available if a top wide receiver or offensive tackle falls to them. Or, given the fact Chicago has just four draft picks, they could elect to trade back.\nWe've rounded up the latest 2024 NFL mock drafts, where most experts believe the Bears will manage to land additional help for Williams in the form of a playmaking receiver \u2014 Rome Odunze or Malik Nabers \u2014 or protection in a offensive tackle.\nLOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA \u2013 NOVEMBER 18: Caleb Williams #13 of the USC Trojans passes the ball during the first half of a game against the UCLA Bruins at United Airlines Field at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum on November 18, 2023 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Sean M. Haffey/Getty Images)\nNFL.com's Daniel Jeremiah has the Bears pairing Williams with a top playmaking receiver.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nThe Bears have cleared the runway by trading Justin Fields. I'll be stunned if Williams isn't their choice at No. 1, and they've built an outstanding supporting cast for him.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 WR Rome Odunze, Washington\nThe Bears could go pass rusher here after adding Keenan Allen at receiver, but I can't resist the prospect of playing Odunze alongside Allen and DJ Moore to give projected first overall pick Caleb Williams a Bengals-like receiving corps.\nDec 2, 2023; Charlotte, NC, USA; Florida State Seminoles defensive lineman Jared Verse (5) reacts during the fourth quarter against the Louisville Cardinals at Bank of America Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Jim Dedmon-USA TODAY Sports\nESPN's Mel Kiper Jr. has the Bears addressing two premium positions at quarterback and edge rusher in the first round.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nThe mystery is gone now, right? Justin Fields was sent to the Steelers over the weekend for a conditional Day 3 pick in 2025, which means Chicago's quarterback depth chart looks like this: Tyson Bagent, Brett Rypien. The franchise stayed out of the veteran market in free agency. The Bears are going to take a passer with this pick, and all signs point to it being Williams, my top-ranked prospect.\nThe good thing for the rookie who takes over? He will have solid playmakers around him on offense. The trade for wideout Keenan Allen was a savvy move by general manager Ryan Poles, and running back signing D'Andre Swift will alleviate pressure on the new signal-caller. Allen and DJ Moore are a really good and versatile receiver duo. Poles & Co. also have some flexibility with the No. 9 overall pick: Will they try to help their defense now?\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 DE Jared Verse, Florida State\nBefore the trade for Keenan Allen, I would have said the Bears should do everything they could to try to get one of the top three wideouts in this class. That's no longer necessary, though Allen will be a free agent in 2025 unless the team gives him an extension. Instead, Chicago has options with its second first-round pick. I'm not totally sold on Braxton Jones being the long-term answer at left tackle, which means offensive line could be in play. And a defense that had just 30 sacks last season (31st in the league) could use help too. So let's add an edge rusher on the other side of Montez Sweat.\nVerse's testing numbers at the combine were impressive, even if I didn't love his 2023 tape. He was too inconsistent at times. But at 6-foot-4, 254 pounds, he has a complete set of tools to be a devastating pass-rusher at the next level, if he can put everything together. The Bears have made a few shrewd moves this offseason, and if their rookie quarterback comes in and plays well, they could be challengers in the NFC North.\nTUSCALOOSA, ALABAMA \u2013 NOVEMBER 20: Dallas Turner #15 of the Alabama Crimson Tide reacts after a sack against the Arkansas Razorbacks during the second half at Bryant-Denny Stadium on November 20, 2021 in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. (Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images)\nThe Athletic's Kevin Fishbain has the Bears going offense and defense with their pair of top-10 selections.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nThe Justin Fields trade was inevitable, but it officially puts the Bears in position to draft a quarterback. While anything could happen between now and the draft, starting with Wednesday's USC pro day and Williams' visit to Halas Hall, nothing has changed the near-consensus evaluation that Williams is the most talented player in the draft. He'll take over an offense that now features Keenan Allen, DJ Moore and Cole Kmet, along with free-agent additions D'Andre Swift and Gerald Everett. It's hard to find a better situation, personnel-wise, for a rookie quarterback.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama\nWith the three top receivers off the board, the Bears hoped to move back \u2013 but the Falcons succeeded in doing so one spot earlier, and apparently no one wanted to trade up for Michael Penix Jr. The consolation prize is the best defensive player in the draft, which would have to delight head coach (and defensive play caller) Matt Eberflus. Despite the addition of Montez Sweat, the Bears finished 32nd in the league last season in sacks per pass attempt. Enter Turner, the SEC's 2023 sacks leader. An outstanding athlete, Turner would be a nice complement to Sweat.\nNov 11, 2023; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) celebrates scoring a touchdown against the Utah Utes during the second half at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Steven Bisig-USA TODAY Sports\nCBS Sports' Josh Edwards has the Bears landing Williams yet another playmaker at wide receiver in the first round.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nWhat can be said that has not already been said about Chicago and Caleb Williams? Yes, Justin Fields was finally traded, but no reasonable person believed they were still torn between the idea of keeping Fields or drafting Williams.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 WR Rome Odunze, Washington\nSome may believe that the trade for Keenan Allen ends any possibility that Chicago may use its second choice in the first round on a wide receiver. I am not in that camp. Allen is a rental. Rome Odunze and D.J. Moore is a long-term plan.\nMalik Nabers 8 as the LSU Tigers take on Texas A&M in Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, November 25, 2023.\nPro Football Focus' Trevor Sikkema has the Bears going quarterback-wide receiver in the top 10.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nWilliams was always the choice, and now that Justin Fields is a member of the Pittsburgh Steelers, we can write this one in pen.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 WR Malik Nabers, LSU\n\"You're telling me Caleb WIlliams is going to get to throw to D.J. Moore, Keenan Allen and Malik Nabers?\"\nYes, that's exactly what I'm telling you.\nOct 28, 2023; Berkeley, California, USA; USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams (13) gestures after scoring a touchdown against the California Golden Bears during the third quarter at California Memorial Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Darren Yamashita-USA TODAY Sports\nYahoo! Sports' Charles McDonald and Nate Tice has the Bears trading up three spots with the Giants to land a top wide receiver with the sixth pick to pair with Williams.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nJustin Fields, out. Caleb Williams, in. We're done here barring some massive change in information in the coming weeks.\nRound 1, Pick 6 (from NYG) \u2013 WR Rome Odunze, Washington\nThe Giants make a trade! And it's not to move up for a quarterback! Instead, the Bears jump ahead and add weapons to their arsenal, snagging Odunze as the perfect complementary piece to pair with DJ Moore and a well-rounded skill set that can be used however new offensive coordinator Shane Waldron wants to draw it up. With Keenan Allen also added to this group of pass catchers this offseason, the Bears have a way to bridge and overlap their weapons' timelines with their shiny new quarterback of the future. The trenches could also be looked at here, but the Bears like where they stand with tackles Darnell Wright (who I think has All-Pro potential) and Braxton Jones, and there just might not be a defensive talent they view as worthy of a nod.\nEVANSTON, ILLINOIS \u2013 SEPTEMBER 30: Olumuyiwa Fashanu #74 of the Penn State Nittany Lions in action against the Northwestern Wildcats during the second half at Ryan Field on September 30, 2023 in Evanston, Illinois. (Photo by)\nFOX Sports' Joel Klatt has the Bears landing Williams and then selecting a top offensive tackle to shore up the offensive line ahead of their rookie QB.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nThe Bears traded away Justin Fields over the weekend, sending him to the Steelers. The move makes it even more clear that the Bears are taking Williams with the No. 1 overall pick, all but solidifying it. Williams is a generational player, a view I've maintained since the start of the season and through the draft process. As I laid out in my quarterback rankings, he excels in my big five categories, which is rare.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 OT Olu Fashanu, Penn State\nI loved what the Bears have done in the first week of free agency, adding Keenan Allen and D'Andre Swift to DJ Moore, Cole Kmet and Darnell Wright to build their offensive foundation. The Bears could trade out of this pick, but why not solidify the other tackle spot? Fashanu's a helluva player and he's just getting better. He's got All-Pro written all over him. You'd also reunite Fashanu with Williams as the two played in high school together.\nSep 24, 2022; Seattle, Washington, USA; Washington Huskies wide receiver Rome Odunze (1) signals for a first down after catching a pass against the Stanford Cardinal during the first quarter at Alaska Airlines Field at Husky Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Joe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\nNBC Sports' Connor Rogers has the Bears landing a top pairing at quarterback and wide receiver to make their offense even more explosive.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nWith Justin Fields officially traded to the Steelers, the Bears are Caleb Williams' team. He walks into an offense with an excellent wide receiver duo in D.J. Moore and Keenan Allen.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 WR Rome Odunze, Washington\nThe Bears trading a fourth rounder for Keenan Allen was a savvy move to give Caleb Williams another productive veteran pass catcher. However, that shouldn't stop them from taking a wide receiver who can be there for the next half decade or longer. This offense could be quite scary quickly.\nSep 9, 2023; Raleigh, North Carolina, USA; Notre Dame Fighting Irish tackle Joe Alt (76) during the first half at Carter-Finley Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Rob Kinnan-USA TODAY Sports\n33rd Team's Marcus Mosher has the Bears landing two of the best prospects in the entire draft at quarterback and offensive tackle in the top 10.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nThere are no changes at the top, as Caleb Williams is the consensus No. 1 pick. He'll have a new weapon to throw to after the Chicago Bears traded for Keenan Allen on Thursday. Surrounding Williams with talent at the skill positions will allow him to succeed immediately in the NFL.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 OT Joe Alt, Notre Dame\nThe Bears don't really need a left tackle, with Braxton Jones playing well in Year 2. But Joe Alt is too good of a value to pass up here. With four quarterbacks and two wide receivers picked in the top six, it allows a talent like Alt to fall to No. 9. The Bears can start Alt at left tackle and solidify their offensive line in front of Williams.\nSep 9, 2023; San Diego, California, USA; UCLA Bruins defensive lineman Laiatu Latu (15) battles against San Diego State Aztecs tight end Mark Redman (81) during the first half at Snapdragon Stadium. Mandatory Credit: Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\nSporting News' Vinnie Iyer has the Bears addressing premium needs at quarterback and edge rusher with their pair of top-10 selections.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nJustin Fields has been traded and the Bears are now locked into Williams, hoping he's a can't-miss franchise passer and athlete to finally provide a long-term solution for their QB woes. This can be put on lock to start the draft.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 EDGE Laiatu Latu, UCLA\nThe Bears also have been rather offensive-focused in their offseason, trading Fields and setting up Caleb Williams by signing D'Andre Swift and dealing for Keenan Allen to support DJ Moore at wideout. GM Ryan Poles can now help defensive-minded coach Matt Eberflus with a versatile pass rusher to complement Montez Sweat.\nDec 1, 2023; Las Vegas, NV, USA; Washington Huskies offensive lineman Troy Fautanu (55) celebrates after the Huskies scored against the Oregon Ducks during the first quarter at Allegiant Stadium.

One of the class' premier movers (regardless of position), Fautanu's tackle-guard flexibility presents the Bears with options. For me, he has an All-Pro type of ceiling at both spots.\nUSC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams (13) during the pregame warmup before playing the Arizona State Sun Devils at Mountain America Stadium in Tempe on Sept. 23, 2023.\nChicago Tribune's Brad Biggs has the Bears drafting Williams and then landing him a top playmaking wideout.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nThe Bears will see Williams throw for the first time at his pro day Wednesday and are expected to host him on a visit to Halas Hall shortly after so they can spend more time with him and get required medical information. Whether a private workout is added to the mix remains to be seen. There are big hurdles to clear - a physical is paramount - but not many remain for the Bears to feel good about choosing him.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 WR Rome Odunze, Washington\nIt's easy to see the Bears going with an offensive tackle or even an edge rusher after trading for wide receiver Keenan Allen. It's also fun to imagine the possibilities with a young receiver to pair with DJ Moore into future years.\nBrian Thomas Jr 11 runs the ball as the LSU Tigers take on Texas A&M in Tiger Stadium in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, November 25, 2023.\nNBC Sports Chicago's Glynn Morgan has the Bears trading back from No. 9 with the Eagles, swapping first rounders (No. 22 for No. 9) and Philadelphia sending No. 53 and a 2025 third-round selection to Chicago. And the Bears still land a top playmaker for Williams.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nThe trading of Justin Fields clarifies the direction the Bears will take once the 2024 NFL Draft begins at 8 p.m. on April 25th. Williams is a dynamic passing talent whose spontaneous creativity keeps defenses off-balance.\nHis ability to accurately pass on-the-move, manipulate throws from unorthodox angles and make plays with his feet set him apart from many of his peers. However, the first and most important victory Williams must attain if the Bears choose him, is winning over a locker room previously devoted to the departed Justin Fields.\nRound 1, Pick 22 (from PHI) \u2013 WR Brian Thomas Jr., LSU\nThe Bears are slowly developing a roster that may resemble an explosive unit, especially if they continue adding aerial weapons like Thomas for their new starting quarterback. Should Chicago trade down to the 22nd overall spot, they might also acquire Philadelphia's 53rd pick (2nd) and a third-rounder in 2025. Based on Thomas' exemplary 2023 season (68 receptions / 1177 receiving yards / 17 touchdowns), he is an amazing talent with unlimited upside.\nDec 2, 2023; Atlanta, GA, USA; Alabama Crimson Tide linebacker Dallas Turner (15) celebrates after a sack in the second quarter against the Georgia Bulldogs in the SEC Championship at Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Mandatory Credit: John David Mercer-USA TODAY Sports\nNFL Wire's Alyssa Barbieri has the Bears landing two top prospects at quarterback and edge rusher with their pair of top-10 selections.\nRound 1, Pick 1 (from CAR) \u2013 QB Caleb Williams, USC\nNow that Justin Fields has been traded, the Bears are 100% taking a quarterback at No. 1 - and there's a 99.9% chance it's going to be Caleb Williams. Chicago will get a chance to host Williams at Halas Hall after his pro day on a Top 30 visit that should solidify the selection. GM Ryan Poles has done everything he can - to this point - to create an ideal situation for a rookie quarterback to come into. Chicago added some shiny new weapons in Keenan Allen, D'Andre Swift and Gerald Everett to pair with DJ Moore and Cole Kmet; they have an average offensive line; and the defense is on the verge of being a top-10 unit - oh and they've still got another top-10 pick this draft. This might just be the most perfect situation a No. 1 QB has ever had.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama\nThe Bears defense is looking to establish itself as a top-10 unit in 2024, and the only concern is edge rusher opposite Montez Sweat. After Chicago didn't sign a starting defensive end in free agency, it certainly looks like edge rusher will be the play at No. 9 \u2014 although they could also trade back from this spot and still land one of the top three edge rushers on the board. But in this scenario, the Bears land arguably the top defensive player in Alabama's Dallas Turner, an athletic freak who would be a huge get for this defense. Turner has a quick first step, speed and explosive skillset that would make him an ideal candidate to pair with Sweat.\nNov 11, 2023; Eugene, Oregon, USA; USC Trojans quarterback Caleb Williams (13) scores a touchdown during the first half against the Oregon Ducks at Autzen Stadium.

Now, it's all but a guarantee that they select Caleb Williams with the No. 1 pick.\nRound 1, Pick 9 \u2013 EDGE Dallas Turner, Alabama\nThe Bears improve their pass rush by drafting Dallas Turner with the ninth overall pick. He will serve as a great complement opposite Montez Sweat.",

Her boyfriend, \nTravis Kelce\n, is definitely making the trip to Las Vegas as the Kansas City Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers in this year's big game \u2014 but details about Swift's appearance are still up in the air.\nKelce and the Chiefs beat the Baltimore Ravens on January 28, \nwinning the AFC Championship\n and securing their spot in the 2024 Super Bowl.\nSwift has yet to speak publicly about her travel plans, but the singer is set to perform in Tokyo on Super Bowl weekend as the international leg of her \nEras Tour\n begins. She'll take the stage at the Toyko Dome in Japan from February 7 to February 10. The Super Bowl, as the NFL Swifties are now aware, will take place on February 11.\nThere are several factors proving that Swift could, in fact, make it to Las Vegas in time. Keep scrolling for a breakdown of all the ways, from time zones to commercial airline flights:\nEverything to Know About Super Bowl LVIII\nGet those dip recipes ready and haul out the sports gear for Super Bowl LVIII, which will see the Kansas City Chiefs take on the San Francisco 49ers. This year's event, which will take place on Sunday, February 11, will be held at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Usher will headline the iconic Apple Music [\u2026]\nTime Zones Exist\nBecause time zones exist in this world, the possibility is real. Tokyo is 17 hours ahead of Las Vegas, Nevada.\nThankfully, \nDrew Barrymore\n broke down exactly \nhow Swift could arrive\n in Las Vegas on time for the Super Bowl's 6:30 p.m. ET kickoff.\n'If she left Tokyo at midnight. The flight time is 11 hours and 35 minutes approximately from Tokyo to Vegas, so she might arrive at 10:30 p.m., but on February 10, leaving her a full night's sleep,' Barrymore revealed during a November 2023 episode of \nThe Drew Barrymore Show\n. Of course, Swift would have to be flying on a commercial airline for this to work.\nFan Flight Calculations\nPatrick Smith/Getty Images\nOther Swifties know that Swift (usually) \nflies by private jet\n. So, they've created their own flight calculations and shared them on social media.\n'Taylor Swift performs in Japan the night before the Super Bowl. It will end around 10pm Tokyo time (5 am Las Vegas time),' one person wrote on X. 'The flight from Tokyo to Vegas takes 12 hours, meaning Swift can arrive at 5pm local on the day before the Super Bowl, 25 hours, 35 mins before kickoff.'\nIf this works out, Swift will be able to get her sleep on the plane in order to be bright-eyed when seeing her man play.\nTravis Kelce and Taylor Swift\nTaylor Swift and Travis Kelce are all anyone can talk about. Swift and Kelce were first linked in July 2023 when the Kansas City Chiefs tight end shared he attempted to ask Swift out after attending her Eras Tour.

For those unfamiliar, 13 is Swift's lucky number. Usually the singer doesn't miss any opportunity surrounding that number, so it's unlikely she'll skip out on the Super Bowl.\nWhich Taylor Swift Rerecord Is Your Favorite?\nThe Commercial Airlines Helping Out (Kind Of)\nWhile this likely won't be necessary for Swift, American Airlines did offer her fans an opportunity to head to Las Vegas to see if she makes it to the game.\nThe company created a round-trip flight from Kansas City, Missouri to Las Vegas, NV, honoring Swift and Kelce's romance. The first flight, out of Kansas City to Vegas on Saturday, February 10, is flight number 1989, which is one of \nSwift's album names\n and the year she was born. The return trip on Monday, February 12, is flight number 87, which is the number Kelce wears on his NFL jersey.",

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS, NV - JANUARY 04: Nvidia Founder, President and CEO Jen-Hsun Huang introduces the Nvidia Spot, a USD 49.95 microphone and speaker that will let owners use Google Assistant anywhere in a home, as he delivers a keynote address at CES 2017 at The Venetian Las Vegas on January 4, 2017 in Las Vegas, Nevada. CES, the world's largest annual consumer technology trade show, runs from January 5-8 and is expected to feature 3,800 exhibitors showing off their latest products and services to more than 165,000 attendees. Photo by Ethan Miller/Getty Images\n\nNvidia is now worth the same as the whole Chinese stock market, Bank of America chief investment strategist Michael Hartnett pointed out in a new note.\n\nThe company's market cap has hit $1.7 trillion, the same as all Chinese companies listed on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.\n\nNvidia's stock soared 239% in 2023 and is up 41% in 2024, through Thursday.\n\nNvidia has grown at an eye-popping pace, to the point where it carries a valuation equal to that of China's stock market as a whole.\n\nIn a new research note from Bank of America, chief investment strategist Michael Harnett noted that Nvidia's $600 billion surge in value over the past two months has pushed its market cap to $1.7 trillion, on par with all Chinese-listed companies on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange combined.\n\nThe chipmaker behemoth's market cap has nearly quadrupled since the start of last year. Its stock soared 239% in 2023, and is up 41% this year alone, through Thursday. Only four US public companies are worth more.\n\nMeanwhile, China's economic malaise has sent stocks tumbling lower. Lackluster economic growth and a prolonged real-estate crash have weighed on the market. The country has also been dealing with deflation. The Hang Seng index, a benchmark for Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks, has dropped 26% over the past year and 8% year-to-date.\n\nBut Hartnett noted there could be an opportunity for investors who can identify Chinese stocks with strong management, balance sheets, and strong earnings. He notes the precedent of Japan's Nikkei collapse in the early 1990s, which then saw a select group of 15 companies possessing those characteristics rallying to a 400% bull market.\n\nRead the original article on Business Insider",

        "summary": "Super Bowl 2024 is setting the stage not just for a showdown between top NFL teams, but also for a major environmental milestone. This year, the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will host a Super Bowl powered entirely by renewable energy \u2014 a first in the history of the event.\n\nThe seemingly desolate area of the Nevada desert is the source of the green energy used to power the game.\n\nA vast solar farm with over 621,000 panels shimmers like a mirage but with the capability to power close to 60,000 residential customers \u2014 or one very big stadium.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders, which call Allegiant Stadium home, have entered into a 25-year agreement to buy power from this new solar installation owned by NV Energy.\n\nCEO Doug Cannon said that the solar installation would supply more than 10 megawatts of power for the Super Bowl. This amount of energy is roughly equivalent to the consumption of 46,000 homes.\n\nSustainability was front of mind as the stadium was being constructed, according to Raiders President Sandra Douglass Morgan.\n\nThe stadium's roof is made of a sustainable plastic material that allows in about 10% of daylight but blocks all solar heat, so it takes less energy to cool the building. The grass field is moved outdoors on a rail system to get natural sunlight rather than using energy-intensive growing lights. And everything from grass clippings to food scraps and cigarette butts are composted or converted into other forms of energy.\n\n\"When you come to a game you may be thinking about just focusing on the game but when they hear that and know that we're being conscious of our environmental footprint hopefully that guest will leave and have that same mindset when they go back home,\" said Douglass Morgan.\n\nThe Super Bowl's green energy push was highlighted during a visit from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who inspected the stadium's main electrical entry room.\n\n\"People sometimes get nervous about renewable power because they're not sure if it's going to be reliable. The fact that renewable power can power a facility like this reliably should speak volumes about what could happen in other communities,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe solar farm not only powers the current needs but also houses massive batteries to store renewable energy, ensuring a five-hour power supply even when the sun isn't shining. This technology is seen as a key component in transitioning the U.S. power grid toward 100% clean electricity by 2035, a goal set by President Biden.\n\nDespite the focus on environmental sustainability, the Super Bowl's entertainment, including a halftime show featuring performer Usher, will not be compromised.\n\n\"We have enough power for Usher and all of his lights and all the fanfare that'll be there,\" said Cannon.\n\nWatch the Super Bowl on your local CBS station, on Nickelodeon and streaming on Paramount+ on Sunday, Feb. 11.",

        "summary": "Pearl Jam will release its 12th album 'Dark Matter' in April, before a world tour kicks off the following month\n\nDanny Clinch Pearl Jam\n\nA new Pearl Jam era is in full effect!\n\nOn Tuesday, the iconic rock band announced its 12th album Dark Matter, released its title track as the lead single and unveiled dates for a massive world tour kicking off this summer.\n\nProduced by Andrew Watt, the album was crafted last year over a three-week stint at Shangri-La Studios in Malibu, California \u2014 and vocalist Eddie Vedder is extremely proud of the project.\n\n\n\n\"We're at this time in our lives when you could do it or you could not do it, but we still care about putting something out there that is meaningful and we hopefully think is our best work,\" said Vedder, 59, during a recent private listening event at the Troubadour in West Hollywood, per a press release. \"No hyperbole, I think this is our best work.\"\n\nDark Matter was crafted with Watt, Vedder, bass player Jeff Ament, guitarists Stone Gossard and Mike McCready as well as drummer Matt Cameron. According to the band, writing and recording as a unit made for a streamlined creative process, resulting in a special album.\n\n\"We felt like we were about to make a really important record,\" said Ament, 60, at the event. \"A lot of that had to do with the atmosphere Andrew set up.\"\n\n\n\nAlexandr Gnezdilov Pearl Jam 'Dark Matter' Album Cover\n\nWatt, 33, a Grammy-winning producer, has become one of modern rock music's tastemakers. Over the past five years, he's worked on albums by rock stars including Ozzy Osbourne, The Rolling Stones and Iggy Pop as well as rock-influenced efforts by pop artists like Miley Cyrus, Post Malone and 5 Seconds of Summer.\n\n\"He has encyclopedic knowledge of our history, not only as a band and how we wrote songs, but as players,\" added Ament of Watt. \"He could pinpoint things we did on old songs to the point where I was like, \u2018What the f--- is he talking about?' His excitement was contagious. He's a force.\"\n\nHe then expressed appreciation for the producer. \"I just want to say thanks for keeping us on track. I couldn't be prouder of us as a band,\" said Ament. \"I feel so grateful for the fans, but mostly for my brothers and these people I've made music with.\"\n\nAlexandr Gnezdilov Pearl Jam\n\nDark Matter will be released on April 19, shortly before Pearl Jam launches a 2024 world tour across nine continents.

        "excerpt": "For sex workers and their clients, Super Bowl season can mean a higher chance of getting nabbed by cops.",
        "summary": "Photo by David Lusvardi on Unsplash\n\nSuper Bowl LVIII is fast approaching. For many Americans, that will mean gathering with friends to watch the game, enjoy some sort of dip-based snacks, and gripe about the halftime show. But for sex workers and those who would like to patronize them, it will mean a higher chance of getting nabbed by cops.\n\nUnder the guise of \"stopping sex trafficking,\" authorities tend to ramp up prostitution stings around Super Bowl time. The ostensible motive behind this is that large sporting events like the Super Bowl draw an influx of traffickers and their victims to the locales hosting these events.\n\nYet no one has managed to marshal evidence of these hordes of traffickers allegedly descending on Super Bowl cities. The best authorities can do is sometimes point to a spike in Super Bowl weekend arrests of sex workers and their customers\u2014a spike easily explained by the fact that cops are making a concerted effort to catch people offering to sell or pay for sex.\n\nThe Super Bowl sex trafficking myth is a sequel of sorts to an earlier idea\u2014that domestic violence increased around the Super Bowl\u2014for which there was also no evidence. Both myths have served a political agenda.\n\nIn this case, the myth gives law enforcement license to do more policing of sex workers and more surveillance generally; lends itself to splashy campaigns by nonprofits that use these theatrics to garner donations; and bolsters an idea (sex trafficking is everywhere!) used to push tough-on-sex-work policies.\n\nSex Workers Call To Stop the Stings\n\nThis year's Super Bowl takes place at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas. Today, Nevada sex workers and their allies will be gathering at the stadium to protest Super Bowl sex stings and the myths that encourage them.\n\n\"Every year, the Super Bowl is used as an excuse to violently arrest sex workers under the guise of anti-trafficking raids,\" notes a press release about the protest, which is being organized by the Las Vegas Red Umbrella Collective (LVRUC); the Sex Workers and Erotic Service Provider Legal, Educational and Research Project (ESPLERP); and the International Sex Worker Foundation for Art, Culture, and Education (ISWFACE). This \"Stop the Raids\" coalition also held two days of workshops and community-building activities for sex workers over the past weekend.\n\nPolice, media, and nonprofits \"are all touting that false and misleading narrative that large sporting events cause forced labor in the sex trade and therefore warrants arresting us,\" says Maxine Doogan of ESPLERP. \"It's clearly not good for us, or the sex trafficking victims or our clients to be burdened and punished with a prostitution arrests.\"\n\nTheir goal \"is to call attention to the public and the press that we're not forced to work in the sex trade,\" says Doogan. \"It's not OK to call us and our clients 'sex-trafficking victims and traffickers.' We're workers, and our clients are our clients.\"\n\nVegas Super Bowl Gives Juice to a Fading Myth\n\nA decade ago, almost all reporting on \"Super Bowl sex trafficking\" seemed to be wholly credulous of law enforcement's narrative. From 2010 to 2016, 76 percent of U.S. print media stories on the subject \"propagated the 'Super Bowl sex trafficking' narrative,\" according to a 2019 paper published in the Anti-Trafficking Review. Back in 2014\u2014when Maggie McNeill challenged this narrative in Reason\u2014questioning it was a pretty lonely perch.\n\nIn recent years, more outlets have been willing to push back against the official narrative, and pieces challenging it have appeared in such publications as Sports Illustrated, The Washington Post, Slate, Vice, and The Atlantic.\n\nBut there's still plenty of life yet in this old trope. Stories about Super Bowl sex trafficking have been peppering Las Vegas media in recent weeks.\n\nSome groups pushing it tend to be less certain in their rhetoric than we've seen previously. But they still suggest that sex trafficking could increase around the Super Bowl. \"It really comes down to basic numbers\u2014where there are people the possibility of crime and trafficking increases,\" posted Agape International Missions (AIM) in January. \"As the Super Bowl draws thousands of people to one location, this holds true.\"\n\nThank you to @its_apenalty for having AG @AaronDFordNV at today's event to discuss how the OAG and law enforcement are working to end human trafficking in Nevada. pic.twitter.com/uOHeE4hH9s \u2014 NV Attorney General (@NevadaAG) January 29, 2024\n\nThe fact that this year's Super Bowl is happening in Vegas gives groups another angle for spreading discredited propaganda. Prostitution is not legal in Las Vegas, but many think it is, due to the city's reputation and the fact that some counties in Nevada do allow legal brothels.\n\n\"While the general link between human trafficking and Super Bowl host cities has become more speculative, Las Vegas may provide an exception to this conclusion,\" AIM suggested, adding that praying and giving to groups like AIM could help combat this.\n\nThis is how a lot of \"anti-trafficking efforts\" go: a mission to raise \"awareness\" about the issue that in turn encourages donations to the nonprofit \"raising awareness.\" Which might all be well and good if these groups were making substantial strides toward helping people in abusive or exploitative situations. But often their \"outreach\" and \"support\" efforts amount to little more than additional \"awareness\" raising, and perhaps handing out bags of toiletries to people police pick up in prostitution stings.\n\nCampaigns like the \"It's a Penalty\" initiative working to spread \"awareness\" about Super Bowl sex trafficking aren't running shelters for victims or helping them find jobs or providing them with legal aid. No, the folks behind these initiatives spend their time and resources doing things like passing out branded stickers and pens, making ads featuring professional athletes, and encouraging people to report their hunches to authorities.\n\nCan You Spot a Sex Trafficker?\n\nA Las Vegas nonprofit called Signs of HOPE \"will be educating employees at Caesars Entertainment, MGM Resorts Wynn Resort properties\" about how to spot sex traffickers, reports the Las Vegas Sun.\n\nThis is another anti-trafficking trope\u2014that eagle-eyed hotel staff, airline employees, salon workers, etc., can spot the \"signs\" of sex trafficking if they're just \"aware\" enough. But the \"signs\" taught tend to be utter nonsense: a mix of sexist, racist, or classist stereotypes with things broad enough to apply to just about anyone.\n\nFor instance, Signs of HOPE chief Kimberly Small told the Sun that the potential signs of being a trafficking victim include lack of eye contact, excessive phone use, or being too quiet.\n\nSigns of HOPE, It's a Penalty, and other groups urge people to report anything suspicious. It's an ethos likely to lead to the harassment of any women dressed provocatively or acting flirtatiously.\n\nHosting spot-a-trafficker trainings may net cash or good P.R. for the groups that run them and the corporations that make employees sit through them. But no one seems to be offering evidence that it is helping anyone catch traffickers or rescue their victims.\n\nWe have, however, seen plenty of cases where it's led to people getting reported for being in interracial couples or multiracial families. There's also some evidence that it leads to increased surveillance of women generally.\n\n\"Small added that people should even be aware of odd-looking situations, such as when a young child is being picked up by an older person, especially if the child seems unfamiliar with them,\" reported the Sun. This manages to mix two trafficking myths into one: the idea that there are large swaths of actual children in the U.S. being trafficked, and the idea that trafficking\u2014of adults or minors\u2014is generally done by strangers.\n\n\"The truth about trafficking, particularly in the context of minors, is that it is often not perpetrated by strangers but by those within their own circles\u2014friends, acquaintances and, tragically, family members,\" writes ISWFACE's Victoria McMahan Parra in The Nevada Independent. \"This pattern of exploitation, deeply rooted in a complex web of socioeconomic factors, reflects a systemic issue that goes beyond the simplistic narratives often peddled by sensationalist media and misinformed anti-trafficking campaigns.\"\n\nWhy the Myths Persist\n\n\n\nMedia in general, and especially local media, tends to be deferential to official narratives, especially when they're coming from cops. Their business also thrives on lurid stories and warnings of danger. So it's not surprising that apocryphal tales of Super Bowl sex-crime spikes keep resurfacing in the press.\n\nMore interesting is why police are framing these efforts as sex trafficking or human trafficking stings in the first place. If it's just an old-fashioned vice squad doing an old-fashioned prostitution sting, why all the fanfare about traffickers? Why not just tell the public they're out to catch consenting adults who mix money with their sex?\n\nReason's J.D. Tuccille explained this pretty concisely back in 2016:\n\nOpponents of commercial sex find themselves on the wrong side of shifting public opinion, so they pull a little rhetorical sleight of hand\u2026.The implication of the \"trafficking\" terminology is that prostitutes are slaves\u2014and they're being hustled off to a major sporting event near you.\n\nSpending taxpayer money and police time to make sure people aren't privately trading sex for money (or vice versa) is the kind of thing many folks dislike. Stopping slavery sounds so much more noble\u2014a cause that everyone can get behind.\n\nIt also lets the federal government get involved. Selling and paying for sex aren't federal crimes. But sex trafficking\u2014defined under federal law as commercial sex involving minors, force, fraud, or coercion\u2014is. That gives the FBI and the Department of Homeland Security a good impetus to intervene (and if the stings just happen to serve as a good cover for all sorts of surveillance, so be it).\n\nFraming prostitution stings as anti-human-trafficking initiatives also lets local law enforcement access grant money the feds give out for stopping trafficking. These grants do not exist, theoretically, for simply stopping some guy from paying a consenting adult partner for sex.\n\nOf course, all of this goes on without anyone having to actually prove that their work is helping victims of violence or abuse.\n\nWhat results are \"taxpayer-funded sting operations\" against \"men and women who are engaged in work our government has deemed unacceptable,\" writes Parra in her Nevada Independent piece. She notes that even when police stings do uncover people who could use assistance or protection, they're often treated as criminals because they fail to fit some perfect victim image. \"These stings, rather than addressing the nuanced and pervasive nature of trafficking, only perpetuate a cycle of criminalization and marginalization of already vulnerable groups.\"\n\nToday's protest in Vegas will be the third for Stop the Raids, which previously organized a protest in Phoenix around Super Bowl time last year and also a protest in Los Angeles last December.\n\nThe Los Angeles rally was held in protest of City Attorney Hydee Feldstein Soto's policies \"that criminalize and harass sex workers and their clients, all under the guise of rescuing sex trafficking victims,\" according to the group's website. \"Feldstein-Soto has been weaponizing the archaic Red Light Abatement Act of 1913 to shut down motels where LA residents, particularly sex workers, had worked indoors safely.\"\n\nToday's Image\n\nLas Vegas, 2022 (ENB/Reason)\n\nThe post It's Time to Retire Super Bowl 'Sex Trafficking' Stings and Myths appeared first on Reason.com.",

        "summary": "Across the largest cities in the U.S., the uptake on flu vaccinations has been split. While an average of 50.7% of people aged 65 and over were inoculated, some cities ranged much higher or lower. The efficacy of the flu vaccine is often argued, as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) claims a 40% to 60% efficacy at reducing flu cases, but only when the strains in that year's vaccine match the spreading virus strains.\n\nWith an eye on flu vaccine preferences, SmartAsset analyzed data from Medicare to rank 100 cities based on the percentage of seniors who received the flu shot in 2023.\n\nKey Findings\n\nThese Midwestern cities top the list for the highest rates of flu vaccinations. In Madison, WI, 69% of Medicare enrollees were vaccinated for the flu season. In Lincoln and Omaha, NE, that figure was 66% and 63%, respectively. In Minnesota, Minneapolis (62%) and St. Paul (62%) also made the top ranks.\n\nMiami, FL has the lowest rate of flu shots. Only 34% of Miami seniors got the flu vaccine last year. El Paso, TX had the second-lowest rate at 36%, while 39% of seniors in Clark County, NV \u2014 including Las Vegas, Henderson, North Las Vegas and Enterprise \u2014 were inoculated.\n\nThe cities with the most seniors are split on flu shots. Seniors make up more than 22% of the population in Scottsdale, Port St. Lucie and Honolulu, and there's no distinct preference for or against the flu shot in these places. Respectively, 52%, 48% and 53% of seniors got the flu shot last year.\n\nTop 10 Cities With the Highest Rates of Flu Vaccinations\n\nMadison, Wisconsin\n\nMadison leads the ranking with a 69% flu vaccination rate among seniors, who represent approximately 13.5% of the city's population. This adds up to 36,707 residents aged 65 and older.\n\nLincoln, Nebraska\n\nIn Lincoln, 66% of seniors have received a flu shot in 2023. Seniors make up 15.3% of the population, which includes 44,656 residents aged 65+.\n\nOmaha, Nebraska\n\nOmaha has a senior flu vaccination rate of 63%, with the 65+ demographic comprising 14.4% of its citizens. This adds up to 70,078 seniors.\n\nDurham, North Carolina\n\nDurham reports a 62% vaccination rate among seniors. The city's population includes 13.8% of residents aged 65 and over, which totals 40,228 seniors.\n\nSt. Paul, Minnesota\n\nApproximately 62% of St. Paul's senior population have been vaccinated against the flu in 2023. Seniors constitute 13.0% of the city's population, with a total of 39,448 residents aged 65+.\n\nMinneapolis, Minnesota\n\nMinneapolis also shows a 62% flu vaccination rate in seniors. This age group represents 11.13% of the city's populace with 47,298 seniors.\n\nRaleigh, North Carolina\n\nRaleigh has a 61% flu vaccination rate among its senior citizens. The 65+ age bracket makes up 12.3% of the population, which adds up to 58,522 seniors.\n\nSt. Louis, Missouri\n\nSt. Louis has a 60% flu vaccination rate for seniors, who make up 15.8% of its population. There are 45,176 residents aged 65 and older.\n\nBaltimore, Maryland\n\nBaltimore's senior flu vaccination rate stands at 59%, with 89,326 seniors accounting for 15.7% of the population.\n\nPlano, Texas\n\nPlano has a 59% vaccination rate among its senior citizens. The 65+ age group makes up 14.30% of the city's population, with a total of 41,479 seniors.\n\nData and Methodology\n\nData is for 2023 and comes from County Health Rankings & Roadmaps. The percentage of seniors with the flu shot is represented by the percentage of fee-for-service (FFS) Medicare enrollees that had an annual flu vaccination. Medicare enrollees must be at least 65 years old. Data was examined for the largest 100 cities for which data was available. Cities are mapped to county-level data.\n\nQuestions about our study?

        "summary": "Where Retirees Are Moving \u2013 2023 Study\n\nFixed incomes can't go as far for retirees with the current pressures from high inflation and a volatile stock market. For some, relocating to a cheaper or more tax-friendly part of the country may no longer be a matter of preference, but a necessity. Recent data suggests that seniors are moving out of expensive northeastern cities and into other parts of the country.\n\nWith this in mind, SmartAsset examined U.S. Census Bureau migration data to uncover where retirees are moving. These cities may be attractive for a multitude of reasons, including community, taxes, recreation, climate and more.\n\nThis is SmartAsset's seventh annual study on where retirees are moving. Read the previous version here.\n\nKey Findings\n\nRetirees are choosing this AZ city more than any other place . Mesa, Arizona topped the list for the nation's highest net gain of seniors for the third consecutive time. In fact, the influx of retirees more than doubled that of the second place city. Florida sees a massive influx of seniors. Florida netted more than 78,000 senior residents from other states in 2021 \u2013 three times as many as the second-ranked state. Miami, Jacksonville, St. Petersburg and Tampa all placed among the top 20 cities gaining the most seniors. In a dramatic reversal, Charlotte drops more than 100 spots. The North Carolina city fell from No. 6 to No. 130. In our last study, Charlotte had a net gain of 1,290 residents 60 and older. But according to the most recent data, 3,150 retirees left Charlotte while only about 1,860 moved to the Queen City from other states. Taxes and climate appear to influence retirees. Nevada, Texas and Florida took six of the top 10 spots for where retirees are moving. Coincidentally \u2013 or not \u2013 these states represent the intersection of warm climates and no state income tax.\n\n\n\nStates Where Retirees Are Moving\n\nIt's no surprise that Florida had the nation's largest net migration of people 60 and older. The Sunshine State attracts tens of thousands of seniors from other states each year, thanks in part to its warm climate and no state income tax. Approximately 54% of seniors who moved into the state in 2021 were in their 60s compared to 46% who were 70 and older.\n\nFour Sun Belt states \u2013 Arizona, South Carolina, North Carolina and Tennessee \u2013 had the next largest net migrations of people 60 and older. Census data shows that there were net inflows of 25,090 to Arizona and 19,004 to South Carolina in 2021. Meanwhile, North Carolina and Tennessee recorded net migrations of 18,996 and 14,767, respectively.\n\nCities Where Retirees Are Moving\n\n1. Mesa, AZ\n\nMesa welcomed 4,967 new residents age 60 and older from other states in 2021. Meanwhile, only 1,338 people 60 and older left the city that year, resulting in a 3,629 net gain. Of the half million people that call Mesa home, nearly a quarter (24.33%) are 60 and older. The warm, low-humidity climate offers a particular comfort for seniors, and Mesa charges a slightly lower sales tax rate than neighboring Phoenix.\n\n2. Henderson, NV\n\nThe first of four Nevada cities in the top 10, Henderson had a net migration of 1,602 seniors in 2021, in part thanks to Nevada's lack of state income tax. The 60-plus age group comprises 25.67 of Henderson's total population (322,202). Retirees enjoy sunshine and warm weather most of the year, and many live in one of Henderson's large 55+ communities.\n\n3. San Antonio, TX\n\nOf the 10 largest cities in the U.S., San Antonio is the only one to crack this study's top 10. The home of the Alamo had the third-highest net migration of retirees across our study, gaining 1,164 senior residents. The weather, abundance of activities and lack of state income taxes in Texas all contribute to its popularity among retirees.\n\n4. North Las Vegas, NV\n\nRoughly 2,300 seniors moved to North Las Vegas from outside of Nevada in 2021, and only 1,190 moved to another state. Its location in the Mojave desert keeps it warm and dry for much of the year, while downtown Las Vegas offers plenty of entertainment, gambling and dining options.\n\n5. Boise, ID\n\nBoise welcomed 2,089 new senior residents in 2021, more than double the number of seniors (991) who left the city for a different state. Boise may attract retirees who prefer mild seasons to a warm climate, and is home to a number of retirement communities.\n\n6. Wilmington, NC\n\nWilmington, NC was the highest ranking coastal city. In fact, no city in our top 10 has a higher percentage of residents 60 and older than Wilmington, where seniors comprise nearly 27% of the total population. In 2021, subtropical and beachy Wilmington had a net migration of 992 seniors. Wilmington boasts an impressive retention rate of retirees, as only 453 people aged 60 and up left Raleigh for another state \u2013 the lowest emigration rate of our top 10.\n\n7. Frisco, TX\n\nFrisco recorded a net gain of 960 people 60 and older in 2021. More than 1,430 seniors moved to Frisco from another state while 476 left the state of Texas. People 60 and older comprise just 13.16% of Frisco's population, the lowest percentage of the 10 cities at the top of our rankings. Among other tax benefits for retired Texans, homeowners can reduce their property tax liability via a special homestead exemption.\n\n8. Miami, FL\n\nWhile Miami has a particularly high cost of living among the big cities where retirees are moving, it offers plenty of amenities from beaches to entertainment to a variety of retirement communities. The city had a net migration of 947 seniors in 2021. Seniors make up nearly a quarter (24.62%) of Miami's total population.\n\n9. Jacksonville, FL\n\nJacksonville \u2013 like Miami \u2013 offers retirees the benefit of no state income tax. That may have helped attract the net 843 new residents aged 60 or higher. Unlike Miami, Jacksonville has a relatively low cost of living compared to the average American city. Beachgoers also have a 30 minute drive between the beaches and downtown.\n\n10. Raleigh, NC\n\nRaleigh had an exceptionally low emigration rate, boosting it into the top 10. Only 454 seniors moved out throughout 2021 \u2013 one more than from Wilmington, NC. This inland city doesn't offer any beachfront amenities, but it does offer a relatively low cost of living when it comes to big cities.\n\nData & Methodology\n\nTo find both the states and cities where retirees are moving, SmartAsset analyzed data from the Census Bureau's 2021 1-year American Community Survey.\n\nThis study considers the populations aged 60 and older (for our purposes, retirees) in 146 of the largest cities in the U.S. for which data was available. We similarly found net migration for each city by subtracting the number of retirees who moved out of the city to a different state in 2021 from the number of people aged 60 and older who moved into the city from a different state. Cities with the highest net migration ranked the highest and vice versa.\n\nLimitations\n\nSome limitations of the data available for this study include:\n\nThe data does not reflect migration within the same state. It only reflects movement from a city in one state to a city in another state. For example, if a person moved to Phoenix from Scottsdale, they would not be factored into our data.\n\nSome retirees might live in multiple places throughout the year; this is not reflected in our metrics.\n\nNot all people 60 and older are retirees.\n\nRetirement Planning Tips\n\nConsider moving to a tax-friendly state. Taxes are an important component of retirement planning. Some retirees end up moving to lower-tax states to maximize their income. SmartAsset has a tool that assesses every state's retirement tax friendliness, which may help you identify where to spend your golden years.\n\nAvoid retiring in a down market. Retiring in a down market can expose you to what's called sequence risk. Withdrawing money from your portfolio during a bear market means you'll lock in investment losses and potentially limit the longevity of your savings. \"Retirees looking to avoid sequence risk may employ a range of strategies to delay or reduce drawdowns in a down market,\" Susannah Snider, certified financial planner and managing editor for financial education at SmartAsset.\"Those strategies can include continuing to work, delaying retirement, withdrawing from cash or other noninvestment accounts, and opting to reduce withdrawals or delay big expenses during early years when the markets are in the red.\" These charts illustrate the impact of sequence risk and show why you may want to avoid retiring in a bear market.\n\n\n\nWork with a financial expert. A financial advisor can be a valuable resource, especially as you approach retirement age. Advisors can help you decide when to collect Social Security, how much income you'll need in retirement and more. Finding a financial advisor doesn't have to be hard. SmartAsset's free tool matches you with up to three vetted financial advisors who serve your area, and you can interview your advisor matches at no cost to decide which one is right for you. If you're ready to find an advisor who can help you achieve your financial goals, get started now.\n\nQuestions about our study?

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS \u2014 Tony Romo has the perfect answer for anybody who asks how he handles the criticisms slung at the NFL on CBS broadcaster.\n\n\"I was the quarterback for the Cowboys for many years, so,\" Romo said Tuesday.\n\nWhich job, then, makes it easier to deal with the naysayers?\n\n\"These are small potatoes,\" Romo said of his current situation.\n\nWell, then somebody pass the gravy.\n\nAs Romo prepares to call his third Super Bowl since transitioning straight from the playing field to the broadcast booth in 2017, the detractors of the CBS broadcast \u2212 namely of Romo \u2212 feel like they have become the majority.\n\n\"I think you're always trying to do new things,\" Romo said.\n\nOne area he has experimented, Romo said, is in showing his non-serious side more often in broadcasts.\n\n\"I add humor in a lot of time,\" he explained. \"So the people who really know me kind of get it. So when I'm joking about Taylor Swift being the wife (of Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce), it's a joke, not everyone gets it.\"\n\nThe problem for Romo is that while his small circle may chuckle, the millions watching \u2212 make that hundreds of millions for the Super Bowl \u2212 aren't. Innocently, Romo says he is trying to add levity to a broadcast that lasts more than three hours.\n\n\"But it's really about the game,\" Romo said. \"And you're always trying to make it about the game. So I just try and keep that focus. I know these teams so well now and you see them consistently.\"\n\n(To that last comment, Romo has to do some explaining, then, about how Jaylen Warren was a revelation to him ahead of the AFC wild-card round despite the Pittsburgh Steelers running back having a considerable role all season.)\n\nIn early 2020, CBS reset the football announcers' market by signing Romo \u2212 who was being courted by ESPN's \"Monday Night Football\" property \u2212 to a 10-year contract worth $17 million per year.\n\nA few offseasons later, the network staged an intervention regarding his level of preparation, according to the New York Post, which CBS denied. Romo's catchphrase \u2212 'Ohhhhhhh I don't know, Jim,' \u2212 has become a meme on the Internet. The Ringer detailed how Romo fixates on the quarterback, the stars, and rarely names other players on the field.\n\nFeb 6, 2024; Las Vegas, NV, USA; CBS Sports analyst Tony Romo (center), poses with play-by-play announcer Jim Nantz (left) and sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson at a press conference at the Super Bowl 58 Media Center.\n\nTHE LAW OF (TRAVIS) KELCE: Will CBS show Taylor Swift during Super Bowl? Depends on Chiefs tight end.\n\nAt the outset of his broadcasting career, Romo could do no wrong. He had a plethora of experience playing against the NFL defenses of the time and could predict a play with uncanny ability. Nantz called him \"Romo-stradamus.\" It was entertaining and educational \u2212 the best of football broadcasting.\n\n\"He has a huge presence and I think he's grown tremendously over the years,\" sideline reporter Tracy Wolfson told USA TODAY Sports. \"I think our broadcast has as well.\n\n\"I learned a lot being alongside him. He just really shows you the nuances.\"\n\nRomo still has a swath of fans who appreciate the excitement and his analysis. For others, his style has become grating.\n\nToo often, airtime becomes filled with Nantz and Romo asking each other \u2212 or other members of the broadcast, like rules analyst Gene Steratore \u2212 to describe what everyone watching on television can already see. The insight is thin. And compared to other top booths with less experience working together \u2212 NBC's Mike Tirico and Cris Collinsworth and FOX's Kevin Burkhardt and Greg Olsen \u2212 their chemistry does not match up.\n\nNFL on CBS lead producer Jim Rikoff said the broadcast team enters each week focused on its craft, not any outside critiques. Romo and Nantz complement each other and are looking forward to putting a bow on one of their better years, Rikoff said.\n\n\"He's learning as he's going,\" Rikoff told USA TODAY Sports when asked about Romo's progression.\n\nGrowth is always good, but that's not necessarily the type of comment a person in the seventh year of any occupation would necessarily want to hear.\n\nRomo entered broadcasting when a back injury \u2212 two surgeries have left him needing an hour to prep his body for daily movement \u2212 and the emergence of Dak Prescott in Dallas ended his playing days. But he doesn't harbor any ill will for taking his last snap at 36 years old.\n\n\"It's almost humbling why anybody deserves everything I've gotten,\" said Romo, now 43. \"So I don't look at it in any negative capacity. I feel like I'm the luckiest guy on earth.\"\n\nA father of three boys ages 11, 9 and 6, Romo added: \"I'm a dad first. I announce second. And this is probably my favorite time in life right now.\"\n\nFootball fans would appreciate if he started announcing like it.\n\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Tony Romo enters CBS' Super Bowl 58 broadcast with plenty of critics",

        "excerpt": "As we approach Super Bowl Sunday, let's take a gander at how the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs got to this point.",
        "summary": "Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes (15) raises the Lamar Hunt Trophy with tight end Travis Kelce (87) after the AFC championship NFL game between the Cincinnati Bengals and the Kansas City Chiefs, Sunday, Jan. 29, 2023, at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City, Mo. The Kansas City Chiefs advanced to the Super Bowl with a 23-20 win over the Bengals. (Via OlyDrop)\n\nSuper Bowl 58 is this Sunday. For the second time in four years, the San Francisco 49ers and Kansas City Chiefs will duke it out for the Lombardi Trophy. However, the paths that each of these teams took to reach this point have been very different.\n\nThe 49ers were the NFC's top seed and didn't need to play in the wild card round. They also struggled against the conference's 7th-seed in the divisional round, needing a remarkable come-from-behind victory against the Green Bay Packers. The following week, the 49ers doubled down on that tactic, needing 27 second half points to take down the Detroit Lions in the conference championship game.\n\nThe Chiefs meanwhile limped into the playoffs, going just .500 over their last ten games of the regular season and falling to the AFC's third seed after a stellar 6-1 start. However, once the playoffs started, the Chiefs reminded us all why they are this decade's dynasty. They've already taken down three of the most potent offenses in the NFL, but now they face the NFL's most efficient offense. Will that make a difference?\n\nHere's how the NFL playoff bracket looks ahead of Super Bowl 58 in Las Vegas.\n\n2023-24 NFL Playoff Bracket\n\nAFC:\n\nStandings:\n\nBaltimore Ravens (13-4) *eliminated by KC in conference championship Buffalo Bills (11-6) *eliminated by KC in divisional round Kansas City Chiefs (11-6) Houston Texans (10-7) *eliminated by BAL in divisional round Cleveland Browns (11-6) *eliminated by HOU in wild card round Miami Dolphins (11-6) *eliminated by KC in wild card round Pittsburgh Steelers (10-7) *eliminated by BUF in wild card round\n\nIn the AFC championship game, the Kansas City Chiefs shocked the Baltimore Ravens in a 17-10 victory. The Chiefs did not score once in the second half, but held the Ravens and MVP favorite Lamar Jackson to just three points after the first quarter.\n\nNFC:\n\nStandings:\n\nSan Francisco 49ers (12-5) Dallas Cowboys (12-5) *eliminated by GB in wild card round Detroit Lions (12-5) *eliminated by SF in conference championship Tampa Bay Buccaneers (9-8) *eliminated by DET in divisional round Philadelphia Eagles (11-6) *eliminated by TB in wild card round Los Angeles Rams (10-7) *eliminated by DET in wild card round Green Bay Packers (9-8) *eliminated by SF in divisional round\n\nThe Detroit Lions were as close as any team can be to representing the NFC in the Super Bowl. However, after building up a 17-point lead in the first half, the 49ers stormed back and won the second half 27-7 to secure the victory 34-31. 49ers quarterback Brock Purdy became the first quarterback in 30 years to throw for 150 yards, complete 80 percent of his passes, rush for 45 yards, average ten yards a carry, and record zero turnovers in a single half.\n\nSuper Bowl 58:\n\nIn a rematch of Super Bowl 54, the Kansas City Chiefs and San Francisco 49ers will square off in Super Bowl 58. The Chiefs won the first matchup 31-20, with Patrick Mahomes and company scoring 21 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to brush off a ten-point second half deficit and secure the franchise's first Super Bowl since 1969.\n\n2023-24 NFL remaining playoffs schedule (all times ET)\n\nNow that the Pro Bowl is behind us, the Super Bowl is set for this Sunday, Feb. 11, 2024. Kickoff is set for 6:30 p.m. and will air on CBS.\n\n\n\nHow to watch Super Bowl 58, Chiefs vs. 49ers: TV, date, channel and time\n\nWhen: Sunday, Feb. 11, 2023\n\nWhere: Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas, NV\n\nTime: 6:30 pm ET/3:30 pm PT\n\nTV: CBS, Nickelodeon\n\nStream: FuboTV, Paramount+, YouTube TV\n\nWatch the game: Stream Super Bowl 58 with Fubo\n\nWe occasionally recommend interesting products and services.

        "summary": "TRUCKEE, Calif. (AP) \u2014 A powerful blizzard that closed highways and ski resorts had mostly moved through the Sierra Nevada by early Monday but forecasters warned that more snow was on the way for Northern California mountains.\nSections of Interstate 80 to the west and north of Lake Tahoe were still shut down late Sunday, with no estimate for reopening, the California Highway Patrol said.\nThe CHP office in South Lake Tahoe warned motorists that tire chains for improved traction are required on routes through the mountains, where more than 7 feet (2.1 meters) of snow fell over the weekend.\nBlizzard warnings had mostly expired but scattered thunderstorms were likely and another 2 feet (60 centimeters) of snow was possible at higher elevations, the National Weather Service office in Sacramento said.\n'Mountain travel is HIGHLY discouraged!' the office warned.\nThe multiday storm caused traffic backups and closures on I-80 and many other roadways, shut down ski resorts for two days, and left thousands of homes and businesses without power.\nBy Sunday night, Pacific Gas & Electric had restored electricity to all but about 4,400 Northern California customers, while NV Energy had reduced its outages to roughly 1,000 homes and businesses across the state line in Nevada.\nPalisades Tahoe, the largest resort on the north end of the lake, was among several ski mountains that closed most or all chairlifts for a second straight day Sunday because of snow, wind and low visibility. Palisades reported a three-day snow total of 6 feet (1.8 meters), with more falling.\n'We will be digging out for the foreseeable future,' officials said on the resort's blog.\nKevin Dupui, who lives in Truckee, just northwest of Lake Tahoe, said his snow blower broke, but it doesn't really matter because there's nowhere to put all the snow anyway. 'We just move it around,' he said Sunday.\nDupui said residents and tourists seem to be mostly heeding warnings to stay home. 'The roads haven't been that safe, so we don't really want people driving around,' he said.\nAnother Truckee resident, Jenelle Potvin, said at first some cynical locals thought 'there was a little too much hype' made about the approaching storm. But then the unrelenting snow began Friday night.\n'It was definitely a blizzard. And we woke up to a lot of snow yesterday and it never let up,' Potvin said Sunday. Her neighbors were snowmobiling and cross-country skiing in the streets.\nIn the eastern Sierra, the Mammoth Mountain Ski Area was closed Sunday as winds of up to 70 mph (113 kph) made it too difficult for ski patrol to complete avalanche mitigation, the resort said. More than 3 feet (nearly 1 meter) of snow fell over three days, and more was on the way.\nWeather service meteorologist William Churchill on Saturday called the storm an 'extreme blizzard' for the Sierra Nevada but said he didn't expect records to be broken.\nThe storm began barreling into the region Thursday. A widespread blizzard warning through Sunday morning covered a 300-mile (480-kilometer) stretch of the mountains. A second, weaker storm was forecast to bring additional rain and snow between Monday and Wednesday, forecasters said.\nCalifornia authorities on Friday shut down 100 miles (160 kilometers) of I-80, the main route between Reno and Sacramento, because of 'spin outs, high winds, and low visibility.' There was no estimate when the freeway would reopen from the California-Nevada border west of Reno to near Emigrant Gap, California.\nRudy Islas spent about 40 minutes shoveling his car out before heading to work at a coffee shop in Truckee on Sunday morning. Neither he nor his customers were fazed by the snow, he said.\n'To be honest, if you're a local, it's not a big deal,' he said.

Now: A Love Story at the Dolby Theater in Hollywood on Tuesday, where she spoke with ET about the emotional story that unfolds in the unique cinematic project.\n\n\"The album that I made was very honest, about kind of wanting to capture this moment in time of reconnecting with a love,\" said Lopez. \"It seems like a fairytale, but it really wasn't. And so I really wanted to tell that part of the story -- the real story, in a way, but not my autobiographical story.\"\n\nAccording to Lopez, she and director/co-writer Dave Meyers \"come up with the idea of telling the story of a hopeless romantic who kind of is going through her life's journey in her search for love, and what it means and what it's about.\"\n\nLopez shared that she showed This Is Me... Now: A Love Story to her 15-year-old twins -- daughter Emme and son Max, who she shares with ex-husband Marc Anthony -- and explained to them how the project explores a version of real events that blend truth and fictional narrative.\n\n\"I was talking to my kids about this, and then they're like, 'Which parts are real and which parts are not?' And I said, 'You will think some parts are real, that are not. And then some parts you don't think are real, are real,'\" Lopez recalled. \"But it is inspired by a lot of the things I went through and it's really about what it has been for me to be a hopeless romantic my whole life, and some of the pitfalls of that.\"\n\nFor Lopez, it was \"kind of exciting and terrifying to explore all of it\" in such a public and open space. \"But for the first time, I felt really compelled to do something that wasn't about anything except wanting to do something, like art for art's sake, and that's why I did it myself,\" she added.\n\nSee the dates for Lopez's This Is Me...Now tour below:\n\nWed Jun 26 \u2013 Orlando, FL \u2013 Kia Center\n\nFri Jun 28 \u2013 Miami, FL \u2013 Kaseya Center\n\nTue Jul 02 \u2013 Austin, TX \u2013 Moody Center\n\nWed Jul 03 \u2013 Edinburg, TX \u2013 Bert Ogden Arena\n\nFri Jul 05 \u2013 San Antonio, TX \u2013 Frost Bank Center\n\nSat Jul 06 \u2013 Dallas, TX \u2013 American Airlines Center\n\nTue Jul 09 \u2013 Phoenix, AZ \u2013 Footprint Center\n\nThu Jul 11 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 Kia Forum\n\nSat Jul 13 \u2013 Anaheim, CA \u2013 Honda Center\n\nTue Jul 16 \u2013 San Francisco, CA \u2013 Chase Center\n\nWed Jul 17 \u2013 Sacramento, CA \u2013 Golden 1 Center\n\nFri Jul 19 \u2013 Palm Springs, CA \u2013 Acrisure Arena\n\nSat Jul 20 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV \u2013 T-Mobile Arena\n\nMon Jul 22 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 Ball Arena\n\nWed Jul 24 \u2013 Tulsa, OK \u2013 BOK Center\n\nFri Jul 26 \u2013 Rosemont, IL \u2013 Allstate Arena\n\nSat Jul 27 \u2013 Indianapolis, IN \u2013 Gainbridge Fieldhouse\n\nTue Jul 30 \u2013 Pittsburgh, PA \u2013 PPG Paints Arena\n\nWed Jul 31 \u2013 Detroit, MI \u2013 Little Caesars Arena\n\nFri Aug 02 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 Scotiabank Arena\n\nMon Aug 05 \u2013 Montreal, QC \u2013 Bell Centre\n\nWed Aug 07 \u2013 Boston, MA TD Garden\n\nFri Aug 09 \u2013 Belmont Park, NY \u2013 UBS Arena\n\nSat Aug 10 \u2013 Newark, NJ \u2013 Prudential Center\n\nTue Aug 13 \u2013 Philadelphia, PA \u2013 Wells Fargo Center\n\nWed Aug 14 \u2013 Washington, DC \u2013 Capital One Arena\n\nFri Aug 16 \u2013 New York, NY \u2013 Madison Square Garden\n\nTue Aug 20 \u2013 Cleveland, OH \u2013 Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse\n\nThu Aug 22 \u2013 Nashville, TN \u2013 Bridgestone Arena\n\nSat Aug 24 \u2013 Raleigh, NC \u2013 PNC Arena\n\nSun Aug 25 \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 State Farm Arena\n\nTue Aug 27 \u2013 Tampa, FL \u2013 Amalie Arena\n\nFri Aug 30 \u2013 New Orleans, LA \u2013 Smoothie King Center\n\nSat Aug 31 \u2013 Houston, TX \u2013 Toyota Center\n\nThis Is Me...

        "summary": "Sierra Ferrell is bringing some goddess energy to the cover of her excellent new album, 'Trail of Flowers,' and that fits. Just two albums into her career, Ferrell is already on the fast track to queenliness, if not godhood, among roots enthusiasts. In a world where a neo-bluegrass guy like Billy Strings can suddenly become a star among the kids, Ferrell may be the closest thing we have to that among female stars. Given the chance, she'll be the one to unite the jam-band crowd, string-band people, singer-songwriter enthusiasts, Gram Parsons-loving country-rockers, hippies, hillbillies and anyone who just likes good, hooky songs.\nFerrell won't be tied down: 'I love to just play whatever brings me joy, and it's not necessarily one sort of genre.' The joy is contagious whenever Ferrell opens up her considerable pipes, which would be enough, even before she enlivens a set with her guitar picking and fiddle playing. Given her participation on Zach Bryan's bestselling album and spots on his tour, even more potential fans are finding out that Ferrell is the full package in the realm of acoustically based music. Variety spoke with her shortly before 'Trail of Flowers' came out and a new tour kicked off, starting with shows at L.A.'s Fonda Theatre April 3-4 (see the full itinerary below).\nYour style sense is always intriguing. You can definitely rock the Nudie's-type suit, like when we saw you recently saluting Gram Parsons at the Grammy Museum. But we never know exactly what your image is going to be the next time we see you.\nA fun part for me is the visual \u2014 the outfits, the different clothes. It makes me happy, and if I feel happy, I can put on a better show for people, and if I put on a better show for people, maybe they'll come back.\nIf there is a predictable element at all to your look, it's that flowers seem to be involved, a fair amount, in your costuming and hair.\nI love flowers, and that's why my record's called 'Trail of Flowers.' Because wherever I go to play, I end up leaving tons of trails of flowers everywhere. And that's how that title even came to be.\nSo you don't mind shedding, a little bit.\nI don't mind shedding a little bit and, in fact, honestly, it's good to shed, it turns out.\nIt looks like you have a gold tooth. Is that something new for you?\nOh yeah, I just got it on. If I was gonna have to put a fake tooth in there, I might as well make it gold, you know? And there's a little heart on there \u2014 for 'Eat your heart out.'\nIn terms of how you arrived at your sound, it's just always intriguing when someone like you comes along who has a kind of purity to her sound. You've said you grew up listening to normal stuff that was on the radio, and not any of the old-time influences we can hear in your music. It wasn't like you had a mom or a grandma who just played 78s all day long.\nYeah \u2014 I wish. I kind of grew up just listening to \u201890s music. I didn't really know much about anything, really. And I feel like I started to learn more about old-time music in my early twenties, when I started going to more festivals.\nThe Grateful Dead is like a gateway drug for a lot of young people now to get into bluegrass and that kind of thing. You were part of a band early on that played Dead covers. Was that part of how it worked for you, or did you had some other kind of entry into some of the older or more acoustic sounds that you incorporate?\nWell, honestly, when I joined that band, I didn't even know who the Grateful Dead was. The band would joke and say, 'Oh, these are songs that we've written,' and they would just snicker and laugh about it with each other. Of course, eventually I found out it was a cover band, and I was OK with it, because they're great songs and it was fun \u2014 and in more of a dance mode, a lot, and so it was fun to dance around and play tambourine on stage. But then that just wasn't enough for me. I wanted to start playing instruments, and I had more songs that I was writing, and they wanted to do the songs they wanted to do, which involved a lot of Grateful Dead covers. That band, 600lbs of Sin, served its purpose, and I'm glad that I got to experience it and be in it, but I knew that there was more for me.\nI knew that there was something else, and I didn't really find out as much about the bluegrass and the old-time community until maybe my early twenties. And I was touring around West Virginia and some neighboring states a bunch, and there was this band called Fox Hunt. They were a string band, and John R. Miller was one of the lead singers and the guitar player in that band. And I wrote that 'Fox Hunt' song [on the new album] in some sort of way to tip the hat to him and to thank him and his group for the inspiration to be where I am now, with my hands and feet dipped in old times.\nA lot of people in the roots community probably have a lot of hopes pinned on you, because you are the kind of representation of acoustic-based music that everyone just 'gets,' whether they've been exposed to it before or not. Do you get that sense that there's kind of a mixed audience for you, from people who are like, 'Yes, this exemplifies everything we love,' to maybe some people who are going, 'I have no idea what this kind of music is, but I like it'?\nYou know, it's funny, though, because some people will reach out and say, 'Oh, I love your music, but take your nose ring out.' It's like a lot of people with opinions, and opinions are like buttholes, and everyone's got one. There's that conservative group that sometimes I tend to pick up because of that old sound that I have. And I am more relatable probably with their children than them, in a sense, where my style is flamboyant and I have piercings, I have a gold tooth, I have tattoos. Honestly, those things are so old, and those are the sort of things that have been around longer than most things. So that's also what's baffling at times \u2014 people do think that they're right and they think that that's what's how things should be, and in reality it's not. And some people need to fucking get their head out of their ass and fucking just either like it or don't, and if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. \u2026 I definitely keep people talking, and I'm OK with that. I'm OK with someone liking me and I'm OK with somebody not liking me.\nWhat was the appeal of the festivals that hooked you into this particular melange of music?\nIt's not something that you go and you're like, 'Hey! I'm playing this festival!' It's more like you go to be able to hear all the musicians, because everyone plays fiddle or guitar or mandolin or banjo and\u2026 I don't know. I just love those instruments. I love instruments that you don't have to plug in. And then if, like, we don't have electricity, do you want to hang out with the electric guitar player and the electric bass player, or the upright bass or the acoustic guitar player? So it's like, so much respect for that style of music, for that reason. For me as a person, when cords and electricity get involved, it gets a little harder.\nYou recently played the Grand Ole Opry for the first time. Was that cool for you?\nYeah, I love the Grand Ole Opry, and I hope to be a member one day. I'm gonna keep going back and playing. I love the old Nashville, like the 'Hee-Haw' era and those shows\u2026 I just love it. That's what made me fall in love with country music.\nYou're on Zach Bryan's self-titled album, on the song 'Holy Roller,' and you will be opening some huge shows for him.\nI feel like that's his 'friends' record, because there's so many of his homies and friends that are just there being a part of the record, and I think that's beautiful.\nHow did Bryan become enamored of what you do?\nWell, we were playing the same festivals and he would come and watch my show side stage. And then, after Railbird (in Lexington, Kentucky), he messaged me and said, ' I have this song; I would love for you to be on it.' And then he sent it to me and I got goosebumps all over my body and I knew that I had to be a part of it. Those are my pull-the-trigger moments, whenever I get body goosebumps from a song or from an artist; it means that I should be working with them. I love that song. I love how gentle I get to be on that song. I like to show my fans too as well that I am very intense, but I can also be very gentle.\nAt your record release party in L.A., you announced what your favorite song was off your neew album, and also your least favorite song Your favorite was 'I Could Drive You Crazy.'\nYes. I love it because it's coming from a place of admitting your strengths and your weaknesses. It's like, 'I can't do this \u2014 but I can drive you crazy.' I think that's something that a lot of people need to lean in more and realize our strengths and our weaknesses, so then we can find people around us with the strengths that we need.\nAnd then you said your least favorite was 'Wish You Well.' Is that maybe because that's probably the saddest song on the album?\nYeah, that's exactly the reason for that: I'm sort of towards the end of my sad era. Everybody loves a sad song, but that's just the condition that we are put in. It's not even 100% our fault. That's just how it is. Once you realize what's really going on behind the grand scheme of everything, like how in the U.S. the rich keep getting richer, and the people in charge keep getting more money, and then they use the tax money for things that we don't need or want\u2026 I just think that it's important to think about something to look forward to and something brighter, something more beautiful.\nYou did say in an interview that it was a breakup that got you started writing songs.\nIt was definitely a breakup that got me started writing songs. And I guess once you find a good vein, you don't really wanna tap another one because you're there; you found it. But I'm in a positivity sort of flip side. Like, instead of people saying 'That's sick!,' I want people to say, 'That's healthy!'\nYou have a song on the new album called 'Dollar Bill Bar.' Did you have any real bar in mind with that one?\nWell, it makes me think of honestly of one of those generic beach bars, where they've got the dollar bills hanging up everywhere. The first bar that actually comes to mind is in South Florida, Key West \u2014 there's this bar downtown that Ernest Hemingway used to hang out at a lot. I don't know 100% what that bar is, but if anyone knows where it is and they want to message me about it, I'd love that.\nThe one song you have on the album that you didn't write is\u2026\n'Chittlin' Cookin' Time in Cheatham County.' Say that three times fast. It's actually very old. It's a slave song from back in the day. That's something that I love to talk about because I don't think people need to forget, and society wants you to forget. It happened, and we can't let this happen again. And we don't have to go 'viva revolution!' right now, but that's kind of where I tend to float a lot, because I just think that we have such a brighter future, and the way that things are, it doesn't look like a bright future, and it's sad and it's depressing.\nSo you're conscious of bringing joy into people's lives.\nI know that my music does that and I love that so much. I am a healer, and I know that I'm here to help heal in some sort of way. If not just myself, then there's a lot of people around me, and I want to be a part of the solution. I mean, people just look at the (present) day, and they don't look at years down the road. We're so self-serving and stuck in our heads, we're like egomaniacs, and I don't know \u2014 I just think that we need a better infrastructure; we need better leaders. I want to be a part of a brighter future for our children.\nYour music hasn't been overtly political, but you're obviously concerned about the state of the world. You have a song called 'American Dreaming.' Would your vision of the American dream cause you to get politically involved in an election year?\nI think that they're left and right wings of the same bird. I think regional voting's very important, because it affects you immediately, and I think that you can actually vote people in. It's not like you're like, 'Oh, I guess I'll pick the lesser of the evils,' which is how it is every fucking presidential election. It is not like you get to actually pick someone and be like, 'OK I want you to run.' No, they always keep it in their family, in some sort of fucking weird bloodline shit\u2026\nI don't even know if I'll ever have kids, and that's OK, because I'm too terrified to have children right now. They're literally feeding us poison, constantly, consistently, in our food and our products, and in reliable places, too. Like where they used to have butter ingredients, now they're cutting corners, and they know what they're doing and they're poisoning us. There's some seasonings now that they find all these heavy metals in there, when you go get dishes from Target and Walmart. It's like, what are you doing? We're not led by humans. Humans care about people; they care about the planet.\nSierra Ferrell Tour Dates\n4/3 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 The Fonda Theatre &\n4/4 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 The Fonda Theatre &\n4/6 \u2013 Olympic Valley, CA \u2013 WinterWonderGrass Tahoe\n4/9-4/13 \u2013 Puerto Aventuras, QR \u2013 The Avett Brothers At The Beach\n4/17 \u2013 Kansas City, MO \u2013 The Truman #\n4/18 \u2013 Oklahoma City, OK \u2013 Tower Theatre #\n4/19 \u2013 Fayetteville, AR \u2013 JJ's Live #\n4/20-4/21 \u2013 Georgetown, TX \u2013 Two Step Inn\n4/23 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Thalia Hall #\n4/24 \u2013 Chicago, IL \u2013 Thalia Hall #\n4/26 \u2013 Minneapolis, MN \u2013 First Avenue #\n4/27 \u2013 Milwaukee, WI \u2013 The Pabst Theater #\n4/28 \u2013 St. Louis, MO \u2013 The Pageant #\n5/9 \u2013 Atlanta, GA \u2013 The Eastern %\n5/10 \u2013 Charleston, SC \u2013 Charleston Music Hall %\n5/11 \u2013 Raleigh, NC \u2013 The Ritz %\n5/12 \u2013 Charlotte, NC \u2013 The Fillmore Charlotte %\n5/14 \u2013 Philadelphia, PA \u2013 Union Transfer %\n5/16 \u2013 New York, NY \u2013 Webster Hall %\n5/17 \u2013 Forest Hills, NY \u2013 Forest Hills Stadium^\n5/18 \u2013 Boston, MA \u2013 The Stage at Suffolk Downs^\n5/21 \u2013 New Haven, CT \u2013 Westville Music Bowl^\n5/22 \u2013 Washington, DC \u2013 9:30 Club %\n5/23 \u2013 Albany, NY \u2013 MVP Arena^\n5/24 \u2013 Canandaigua, NY \u2013 Constellation Brands-Marvin Sands Performing Arts^\n5/26 \u2013 Cumberland, MD \u2013 DelFest\n6/4 \u2013 Los Angeles, CA \u2013 Crypto.com Arena*\n6/6-6/8 \u2013 Torrey, UT \u2013 Forest Desolation Fest\n6/7 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV \u2013 T-Mobile Arena*\n6/8 \u2013 Las Vegas, NV \u2013 T-Mobile Arena*\n6/14 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 Empower Field at Mile High*\n6/15 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 Empower Field at Mile High*\n6/20-6/23 \u2013 Telluride, CO \u2013 Telluride Bluegrass Festival\n6/27-6/29 \u2013 Eau Claire, WI \u2013 Blue Ox Festival\n7/12-7/14 \u2013 Whitefish, MT \u2013 Under The Big Sky Festival\n7/26 \u2013 Floyd, VA \u2013 Floydfest\n7/28 \u2013 Newport, RI \u2013 Newport Folk Fest\n8/10 \u2013 Vancouver, BC \u2013 Orpheum Theatre!\n8/11 \u2013 Seattle, WA \u2013 Woodland Park Zoo Amphitheatre!\n8/12 \u2013 Portland, OR \u2013 Pioneer Courthouse Square!\n8/14 \u2013 Boise, ID \u2013 Idaho Botanical Garden: Outlaw Field!\n8/16 \u2013 Denver, CO \u2013 The Mission Ballroom!\n8/18 \u2013 Santa Fe, NM \u2013 The Bridge at Santa Fe Brewing Co.\n8/24 \u2013 Memphis, TN \u2013 Overton Park Shell\n9/1 \u2013 Columbia, MD \u2013 Merriweather Post Pavilion with Mitski\n9/10 \u2013 Toronto, ON \u2013 Massey Hall\n9/14 \u2013 Asbury Park, NJ \u2013 Sea.Hear.Now.

        "summary": "PEOPLE has an exclusive look at the 10 finalists competing for the inaugural title, which include musicians, an aerialist, hand balancers and one rollerblading sibling duo\n\nTrae Patton/NBC From left: Howie Mandel, Heidi Klum, host Terry Crews, Mel B and Simon Cowell on 'America's Got Talent: Fantasy League'\n\nAmerica's Got Talent's finalists are getting ready to compete for the inaugural Fantasy League crown!\n\nThe America's Got Talent spinoff closed out its last semifinals episode this week and is now gearing up for its two-part finale beginning on Monday night.\n\nAfter a season of twists and turns, dazzling performances and tight competition, America has named the top 10 finalists. As they get ready to deliver their final performance of the season, PEOPLE can exclusively debut new photos of all the finalists.\n\nLearn more about each act's AGT journey and which judge's team they're competing on below.\n\n\n\nSimon Cowell's fantasy team\n\nMUSA MOTHA\n\nOne of Simon Cowell's OG draft picks, dancer Musa Motha first competed on Britain's Got Talent season 16 in 2023. He had dreams of becoming a professional football player but was diagnosed with cancer around age 10. The illness caused the South Africa resident to lose his left leg, but that hasn't stopped him from dancing from his way into the hearts of viewers around the world.\n\n\"When the music starts and I'm on stage performing, nothing matters. It's just me and the music and the stage performing for people,\" Musa said in a recent episode.\n\nAfter a virtual qualifier's performance, Musa wowed the judges during the semifinals round and earned Simon's Golden Buzzer, sending him straight to the finale.\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Musa Motha\n\nPACK DRUMLINE\n\nHailing from Chicago, the energetic percussion group formed in 2014 but wasn't introduced to viewers until season 17 of America's Got Talent in 2022.\n\nAfter being drafted by Simon on Fantasy League, the drumline, which is founded and directed by Perry Dontae, delivered two show-stopping performances \u2014 the second of which earned them a spot in the finale after receiving the vote from America.\n\n\"We came from nothing, we create this from the hearts,\" Dontae said on stage after their latest performance.\n\n\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Pack Drumline\n\nSAINTED\n\nThe powerhouse choir \u2014 which was formed in 2020 \u2014 first competed on America's Got Talent during season 18 in 2023, but were eliminated in the semifinals.\n\nSimon then drafted them for his Fantasy League team, and they came back swinging. After getting permission to use Prince's \"Purple Rain\" \u2014 a song that is rarely cleared, according to producers \u2014 the 25+ person, gospel-meets-hiphop choir wowed the judges with their soulful rendition in the qualifier round. As a result, Simon ended up using his Golden Buzzer, sending Sainted straight to the finale.\n\n\"I remember being a kid rehearsing in the mirror, pretending that we were before crowds like this,\" Sainted director Dennis Reed Jr. said after the exciting moment. \"Never stop believing, always keep dreaming, you can do it! You can make it!\"\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Sainted\n\nHeidi Klum's fantasy team\n\nV. UNBEATABLE\n\nThe dance/acrobatic group from Mumbai made their mark during season 14 of AGT in 2019 but placed fourth in the competition. They later returned for AGT: The Champions season 2, where they ultimately won the entire thing.\n\nThis time, the group returned to the AGT stage as one of Howie Mandel's draft picks. However, after their mesmerizing routine in the semifinals, Heidi Klum used her Golden Buzzer, which allowed her to the steal the group and send them through to the finale on her team.\n\n\"How do you become greater than great? Only V. Unbeatable can do that,\" Howie told the group before they were stolen by Heidi, who later said, \"I literally sit here and say, \u2018Did I just see that?' I mean, it's so insane!'\n\n\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO V. Unbeatable\n\nSOFIE DOSSI\n\nThe contortionist and hand-balancer first appeared on AGT screens during season 11 in 2016. Though she made it to the top 10, Sofie was later eliminated. She returned in 2019 for season 1 of AGT: The Champions.\n\nOn Fantasy League, Sofie was drafted by Heidi. After delivering an impressive qualifier performance, Sofie received Heidi's Golden Buzzer, cementing her place on the judge's team and sending her straight to the finale.\n\n\"You did not really actually need my Golden Buzzer but I pushed it because I love you and I believe in you and I think you're amazing,\" Heidi told her following her show-stopping act.\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Sofie Dossi\n\nMel B's fantasy team\n\nBILLY AND EMILY ENGLAND\n\nThe rollerblading sibling duo first competed on Britain's Got Talent season 9 in 2015 before crossing over to the AGT stage for season 12 in 2017, and later, AGT: The Champions season 1.\n\nThough the daring duo never won a Got Talent franchise, they won big when they were drafted by Simon for Fantasy League. After performing a thrilling qualifiers performance \u2014 complete with flaming knives at the tip of Emily's skates \u2014 the siblings were stolen by Mel B with her Golden Buzzer.\n\n\n\nWith their spot cemented in the finale, Billy and Emily were beyond thrilled to be one step closer to an AGT crown. \"We are so excited to show you what's possible on skates,\" the sibling duo wrote on Instagram, adding in another post, \"If someone would [have] told us as kids this would happen in 2024, we would not have believed it.\"\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Billy and Emily England\n\n\n\nAIDAN BRYANT\n\nThe self-taught aerialist has been a fan-favorite act ever since he was introduced on AGT in season 16 in 2021. Though he finished in second place to magician Dustin Tavella, Aidan later returned to compete in AGT: All-Stars, where he won the whole thing in February 2023.\n\nDrafted by Heidi for Fantasy League, Aidan consistently wowed the judges \u2014 so much so that Mel B ended up using her Golden Buzzer to steal him and bring him onto her team.\n\nNow set to compete in yet another AGT finale, Aidan says the moment feels \"surreal.\"\n\n\"I've never gotten a Golden Buzzer before so this is my night! I'm so blessed,\" he added on the night he was stolen by Mel B.\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Aidan Bryant\n\nHowie Mandel's fantasy team\n\nRAMADHANI BROTHERS\n\nThe hand and head-balancing brothers from Tanzania came to AGT during season 18 in 2023, but finished in fifth place despite their unbelievably thrilling acts.\n\nHeidi then drafted them to her Fantasy League team, but after their qualifiers performance, Howie couldn't help but use his Golden Buzzer to steal the brothers \u2014 even if it meant having Heidi tackle him to the ground.\n\n\"You can do so much better with the right coach,\" Howie joked after pushing his buzzer and sending the brothers straight to the finale, as Heidi later tweeted, \"I love the Ramadhani Brothers sooooo much ... Howie, thank you very much for sticking your big head into the middle of MY winning act.\"\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Ramadhani Brothers\n\nKODI LEE\n\nKodi is undoubtedly one of the most memorable acts to walk the AGT stage. He was first introduced to audiences in 2019 during season 14 of AGT, in which he earned then-judge Gabrielle Union's Golden Buzzer and went on to win the entire competition.\n\nAlong with his unforgettable vocal talents, Kodi's life story has made him a fan favorite. The Lake Elsinore, California, native was born with optic nerve hypoplasia and diagnosed with autism at age 4. His mother Tina accompanied him on stage for the entire competition \u2014 and has continued to do so as he performs in Las Vegas and during his return for AGT: All-Stars in 2023.\n\nSimon drafted Kodi for Fantasy League, but after the 27-year-old's moving semifinals performance, Howie used his Golden Buzzer to steal him and send him to the finale.\n\n\n\n\"Kodi is the biggest gift I have ever experienced on this stage. Welcome to Team Howie,\" Howie tweeted after the steal.\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Kodi Lee\n\nSHADOW ACE\n\nShadow Ace previously competed on Pilipinas Got Talent during season 5 in 2016 and Asia's Got Talent season 3 in 2019. The Philippines native then made his AGT debut during season 18 in 2023, wowing audiences with his shadow puppet artistry, but was eliminated in the semifinals.\n\nShadow Ace, whose real name is Philip Jos\u00e9 Galit, returned to Fantasy League when he was drafted by Howie. His creative, upbeat and original routines \u2014 complete with an assist from Simon's head shadow \u2014 continued to impress and ultimately earned him America's vote during the semifinals round, earning him a spot in the finale.\n\n\"You stepped it up. I think that was your funniest, best routine yet,\" Howie said after his performance.\n\nJOE SCHMELZER, TREASURBITE STUDIO Shadow Ace\n\n\n\nThe 10 finalists are set to give their final performances this Monday. The following week, Feb. 19, America's Got Talent: Fantasy League will announce a winner voted by the studio audience.\n\nThe finale episode will feature guest performers Calum Scott, Robin S., Sheila E. and Steven Sanchez. Fellow AGT: Fantasy League competitors Drake Milligan, Chapel Hart, Loren Allred, and Brian Justin Crum are also set to return to the stage, as well as Olympic Gold Medalist David Taylor for unforgettable performances.\n\nIn addition to nabbing the inaugural Fantasy League trophy, the winner will also receive a $250,000 grand prize.\n\nNever miss a story \u2014 sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.\n\nAmerica's Got Talent: Fantasy League's two-part finale airs Monday, Feb. 12 and Monday, Feb. 19 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on NBC.\n\n\n\nFor more People news, make sure to sign up for our newsletter!\n\nRead the original article on People.",

Together, they are helping to create a new era of sustainability in sports\u2014one where sustainability and business practices are not mutually exclusive.\n\n\n\"Football's biggest game is one of the most anticipated and exciting\u00a0events of the year, but we must consider the lasting impacts these celebrated moments have on the environment and communities\u2014and all decarbonization journeys must start with continuous measurement, benchmarking and better data,\" said\u00a0Adam Kramer, CEO of NZero. \"The sustainability ambitions of the Raiders and Allegiant Stadium leadership teams are commendable. We're helping these organizations monitor their decarbonization plans on game days and off days, by the hour, and across Scopes, all to help them reach their goal of net zero. Hosting an event on our country's largest stage powered by 100% CFE is a culmination of years' worth of efforts, and we are proud to be their partner in this achievement.\"\nCFE doesn't happen on its own, and at the center of this achievement is the 25-year energy supply agreement between the Raiders and NV Energy. Starting in \nOctober 2023\n, the agreement ensures a commitment to power Allegiant Stadium, the Raiders' administrative facilities and the \nHenderson\n practice facility with 100% CFE, including energy from new, in-state solar power plants. Through this agreement, the Raiders are actively engaging in initiatives that advance the integration of clean and renewable energy into \nNevada's\n electric grid.\nNZero tracks energy and emissions in real-time, allowing insights into emissions reduction efforts before and after the NV Energy agreement. Across all three Scopes\n1\n\u00a0for 2022, the Raiders organization saw a 15% reduction in carbon emissions for the year. Following the implementation of the NV Energy agreement in 2023, reductions increased to 30% for the full year. Looking ahead at 2024, assuming no change in Scope 1 and Scope 3 emissions, the Raiders' emissions are projected to reach a 68% reduction, a remarkable achievement in only two years \u2013 attributable to Allegiant Stadium being powered by renewable energy.\n\"This achievement marks a new era for sustainability in sports, but it would not be possible without a firm handle on our emissions and energy data alongside a decarbonization roadmap. Better, real-time data is helping us create a greener future for football on our home turf, while setting a new standard for other stadiums, venues and events on the world stage,\" said \nSandra Douglass Morgan\n, president of The Las Vegas Raiders. \"Allegiant and our team are making a remarkable step forward, but sustainability is a team sport and has required the commitment and support of our partners, fans and the local community. We appreciate NZero's crucial role as a trusted advisor as we seek to drive change that helps the planet and inspires other organizations.\"\nThis year's Big Game will also benefit from the Raiders and Allegiant Stadium's waste diversion program (Scope 3 emissions), recognized by the Green  Alliance with their Play to Zero Award. NZero calculated that since 2022, waste diversion has avoided emissions equivalent to taking 75,777 cars off the road during game time on the big day.\nIn July of 2023, Allegiant Stadium was awarded LEED Gold Certification by the U.S. Green Building Council, representing a significant achievement in green building design and environmental sustainability. The \nLas Vegas\n-based stadium isn't just the greenest, but it's the highest grossing in the country, showcasing the power of building sustainability into a larger business plan.\nTo learn more about NZero, please visit \nhttps://nzero.com/\n.\n NZero\u00a0\nNZero\n\u00a0is a real-time data and decarbonization platform for sustainability leaders in government and business that seek to measure, analyze, report and act on sustainability initiatives across all three scopes.

        "summary": "LAS VEGAS, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Pacific Processin g, a leading provider of ATM equipment, services, and portfolio management, today announces a $10M capital raise to fund ATM portfolio \"Partial Acquisitions\" or full acquisitions and within seven key markets throughout Southern California and Las Vegas, in addition to a nationwide \"Micro Partnership\" offering. Qualifying ATM portfolios should have between 25-250 machines.\nThese unique and blended acquisition/partnership strategies will allow independent ATM deployers (IADs) to grow their business by selling a piece of their company and rolling that cash back into their cash-loading inventory. Partnering with Pacific Processing leverages access to capital, industry knowledge, unique proprietary forecasting algorithms, and software enhancement tools that maximize operational efficiency, uptime and profitability.\n\"When I first started my ATM business in 2008 - with just a $5,000 loan - I continuously plateaued through different partner investors. I often outgrew their capital capacities faster than anticipated,\" said Gianni Del Vecchio, CEO and Founder of Pacific Processing, \"What I needed was a funding source that allowed my company to unlock it's full growth potential without inhibiting the needs of our very cash-intensive business.\"\n\"It doesn't have to be this way,\" says Del Vecchio. \"Having built my fleet from scratch, I respect the hustle and grind of ATM operators, physically installing hundreds of ATMs with my own bare hands and performing over 10,000 cash loads over 15 years. I built this fund to alleviate the cash-intensive hamster wheel pressure felt by IADs that often prevents them from having a higher quality of life and the ability to grow to their maximum potential. The goal with this acquisition/partnership program is to help IADs accomplish their dream of being a business owner, instead of having the business 'own them.'\"\n\"Now that I've found the right capital partner, our organic growth has more than doubled and we are well positioned to help would-be partner IADs that show ambitious growth trajectories from 'getting stuck' scaling their own companies through this unique growth model,\" Del Vecchio continues.\n\"Pacific Processing's \"Partial Acquisition\" and \"Micro Partnership\" offerings are designed to allow ATM operators to scale more quickly, take more than a three-day vacation, not suffer to keep machines afloat through every single federal holiday weekend, and have more control over their growth.\"\nPacific Processing is making full or Partial Acquisitions strategically in the following markets:\nLos Angeles County, CA\nRiverside County, CA\nSan Bernardino, CA\nVentura County, CA\nOrange County, CA\nSan Diego County, CA\nClark County, NV (Greater Las Vegas Area)\nThe company's goal is to purchase 50-100% of the portfolio. If a full acquisition is completed, Pacific Processing will take over vaulting the ATMs within three months. \"This is an ideal option for those who are ready to exit the business or need a strategic partner to allow them to make alternative investments or grow their portfolio,\" says Del Vecchio.\nPacific Processing is also making nationwide Micro Partnerships where it buys 50-75% of the ATM portfolio, allowing the seller to continue profiting by vaulting the ATMs for a minimum of 36 months. \"This option is designed for IADs that want to supplement their vault cash with their recently redeemed cash and continue vaulting their terminals with lower frequency intervals, reinvest the capital back into growth strategies, or make alternative investments.\"\nIn continued growth situations, Pacific Processing will support and fund the operator in a pro-rata fashion to keep ownership percentages equal to the time of investment, ensuring success and quality care of the capital investment. A quarterly rolling valuation on the ATM Portfolio will be conducted to measure and track growth over time.\nAlthough all business inquiries will be considered, ATM portfolios meeting the following criteria, will take priority:\n25-250 ATMs\n$5,000-75,000/month gross profit\n70% or more contract coverage\nProcessing-only businesses and IADs with at least ten fully trained affiliates with a minimum of 70% contract coverage and/or merchant-owned portfolios, with strong contract coverage, will also be considered.\nInterested IADs are invited to SUBMIT DEALS HERE or send an email directly to [email protected].\nABOUT PACFIC PROCESSING \u2014 Founded in 2008 by Gianni Del Vecchio, Pacific Processing has quickly become a leader in the US ATM industry.

        "summary": "Expensive, coastal and Western markets are already heating up as spring season approaches\n\nWell-priced homes are selling in 29 days, and that will shorten quickly as the shopping season opens.\n\nMispriced inventory is lingering, however; an elevated 1 in 5 sellers are cutting prices to find buyers.\n\nNew listings and total inventory are up slightly over last year, an encouraging sign for buyers.\n\nSEATTLE, Feb. 14, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Both buyers and sellers should prepare for a competitive home shopping season this spring. The latest market report1 from Zillow\u00ae shows that well-priced homes are being snapped up quickly, while those that linger on the market are seeing their asking prices cut.\n\nZillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\"Some of the homes loitering on the market may just need the right buyer and digital curb appeal to cast a wider net, but many may be overpriced. There are slightly more homes for sale than this time last year, and there is still plenty of competition for well-priced houses,\" said Zillow Chief Economist Skylar Olsen. \"Buyers should prep their credit scores and sellers should prep their properties now \u2014 attractive listings are going pending in less than a month, and time on market will shrink in the weeks ahead.\"\n\nWhat buyers are seeing\n\nJust over 1 in 5 houses on Zillow saw a price cut in January \u2014 that's about equal to last year, but more common than in any of the five preceding years. Those cuts are bringing seller expectations more in line with the market conditions \u2014 the typical sold home was on the market for 29 days before going pending, while other homes lingered on the market for months, driving up the typical age of listings on Zillow to 72 days.\n\nShoppers already touring virtually and in person might be able to negotiate a deal on a house that's been waiting just for them. But that's likely not the case in places where median time on market for sold homes has dropped the most since last year: Las Vegas (down 32 days), Phoenix (30) and Seattle (28).\n\nSo where are the \"deals\" drying up and where are they plentiful? Price cuts are much less common than a year ago in expensive Western metros: Seattle, Las Vegas, Austin and San Jose.\n\nPrice cuts are most prevalent in Florida and Texas markets and in Phoenix. These are areas where total inventory is higher than before the pandemic \u2014 as in Austin and San Antonio \u2014 or where inventory declines are comparatively low.\n\nThere are a few more options available now than last year. Total inventory is up more than 3% from a year ago, while the flow of new listings to the market is up nearly 6%. January typically sees a significant jump in new inventory over December, and this year that monthly boost was 43%. Unfortunately \u2014 and in keeping with unimpressive Januaries over the past few years \u2014 that was a relatively small bump up.\n\nWhat sellers are seeing\n\nSellers are still sitting pretty with record home equity. The typical U.S. home value is up nearly $100,000 since 2020, now standing at $344,159. Annual appreciation of 3.6% nationwide is fairly healthy, and only three of the 50 largest U.S. metros saw their home values fall over the year.\n\nMore than a quarter of homes sold for more than asking price in December, the most recent data available. That's fewer than in the rate-fueled real estate rush of the early pandemic, but slightly more than in December 2022 and far more than before the pandemic, when less than 20% of homes sold over list price.\n\nMetros where sellers are showing up much stronger than last year are San Diego, where new listings are up 28% annually, Miami (22%) and Riverside (20%).\n\nWhat to expect in coming months\n\nAll this points to a relatively competitive home shopping season in which attractive listings are moving quickly. Demographic factors and a relatively strong economy mean vast numbers of millennials and baby boomers looking for houses, even while affordability is still extremely challenging.\n\nBuyers should get their credit in order, talk to a loan officer to understand their budget, and search by monthly payment to make sure their search results stay within their budgets, regardless of mortgage rate swings. Relevant down payment assistance programs are on every Zillow listing.\n\nFor sellers, it's important to work with an agent who understands local market conditions and will price their home correctly.

        "summary": "New Listings Soar Higher as Spring Ramp-Up Approaches\n\n\nDENVER\n, \nFeb. 15, 2024\n /PRNewswire/ -- In what could be a good sign for buyers, the number of newly listed homes in January was a whopping 66.3% higher than in December and 21.5% higher than \nJanuary 2023\n across the 50 metro areas surveyed.\n\n\nThe 21.5% year-over-year increase in new listings reversed a multi-year January trend, as new listings dropped 5.1% from \nJanuary 2022\n to \nJanuary 2023\n and 8.1% from \nJanuary 2021\n to \nJanuary 2022\n. The dramatic 66.3% month-to-month increase in new listings was also significantly higher than the past two December-to-January jumps \u2013 39.8% to start 2023 and 24.7% to begin 2022.\n\n\nThe surge in new listings was combined with year-over-year increases in closed sales and inventory, illustrating that January's housing stats could bode well for the typical spring uptick in home sales this year.\n\n\nJanuary home sales were 2.5% higher than \nJanuary 2023\n, although they were down 19.1% from December,\u00a0a slightly smaller post-holiday drop than the past two years. January inventory increased 1.7% over \nJanuary 2023\n, ending a seven-month streak of year-over-year declines. The median sales price of \n$405,000\n was 5.2% (or \n$20,000\n) higher than \nJanuary 2023\n and unchanged from December.\n\n\n\"It was encouraging to see the surge in new listings, as January stats can be a sign of things to come,\" said \nNick Bailey\n, President and CEO of RE/MAX, LLC. \"Potential buyers and sellers considering a move this year should prepare by securing a qualified agent who can help them understand the local market and help them through the process. If new listings continue to emerge and interest rates drop a bit over time, 2024 could be a year of great opportunity for buyers and sellers.\"\n\n\nLori Galarza\n, Broker/Owner of RE/MAX Central in \nLas Vegas, Nevada\n, said buyers and sellers in her market had to come ready in January. \"\nLas Vegas\n is very desirable right now, thanks to a relocation boom from Californians who are looking for a lower cost of living. That desirability drove January sales and pushed days on market down. I expect the trend to continue as we are starting to see more activity with buyers who are feeling more confident about purchasing this year.\"\n\n\nOther metrics of note:\n\n\n\n\nHomes took an average of 45 days to sell \u2013 one day less than December and three days less than \nJanuary 2023\n.\n\n\nJanuary 2024\n sales averaged 98% of the listing price, the same as in December and up from 97% one year ago.\n\n\nJanuary's Months' supply of inventory was 2.1, compared to 2.4 in December and 2.0 one year ago.\n\n\n\n\nHighlights and local market results for January include:\n\n\nNew Listings\nOf the 50 metro areas surveyed in \nJanuary 2024\n, the number of newly listed homes was up 66.3% compared to \nDecember 2023\n and up 21.5% compared to \nJanuary 2023\n. The markets with the biggest year-over-year increase in new listings percentage were \nHonolulu, HI\n at +73.4%, \nCharlotte, NC\n at +72.8%, followed by a tie between \nBozeman, MT\n and \nMilwaukee, WI\n at +66.4%.

RE/MAX was founded in 1973 by \nDave and Gail Liniger\n, with an innovative, entrepreneurial culture affording its agents and franchisees the flexibility to operate their businesses with great independence. RE/MAX agents have lived, worked and served in their local communities for decades, raising millions of dollars every year for Children's Miracle Network Hospitals\n\u00ae\n and other charities.

For the latest news about RE/MAX, please visit news.remax.com.\n\n\nReport Details\nThe RE/MAX National Housing Report is distributed monthly on or about the 15th. The Report is based on MLS data for the stated month in 50 metropolitan areas, includes single-family residential property types, and is not annualized. For maximum representation, most of the largest metro areas in the country are represented, and an attempt is made to include at least one metro area in almost every state. Metro areas are defined by the Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\nDefinitions\nClosed Transactions are the total number of closed residential transactions during the given month. Months Supply of Inventory is the total number of residential properties listed for sale at the end of the month (current inventory) divided by the number of sales contracts signed (pending listings) during the month. Where \"pending\" data is unavailable, an inferred pending status is calculated using closed transactions. Days on Market is the average number of days that pass from the time a property is listed until the property goes under contract. Median Sales Price for a metro area is the median sales price for closed transactions in that metro area. The nationwide Median Sales Price is calculated at the nationwide aggregate level using all sale prices from the included metro areas. The Close-to-List Price Ratio is the average value of the sales price divided by the list price for each closed transaction.\n\n\nMLS data is provided by Seventy3, LLC, a RE/MAX Holdings company. While MLS data is believed to be reliable, it cannot be guaranteed. MLS data is constantly being updated, making any analysis a snapshot at a particular time. Every month, the previous period's data is updated to ensure accuracy over time. Raw data remains the intellectual property of each local MLS organization.\n\n\nSOURCE RE/MAX, LLC",

        "summary": "Five overall trends have emerged from the 2024 Winter Fancy Food Show.\n\n\n\n\nPost this\n\n\n\n\n\n\"The Winter Fancy Food Show gave participants an advance look at the year ahead in specialty foods. Thanks to our Trendspotters, as well as many other experts and influencers who joined us in \nLas Vegas\n, our Show provides crucial insights and forecasting at the start of the food industry's annual cycle. Trends at last month's Show included comfort foods from around the globe prepared using plants rather than animal-based ingredients; fruits as part of a snacking occasion and a prevalence of the Japanese citrus fruit yuzu, in particular; and elevated takes on classic favorites,\" said SFA President \nBill Lynch\n.\n\n\nThe Winter Fancy Food Show Trendspotters included\n\u00a0 \nPatsy Ramirez-Arroyo\n, food and sustainability consultant, PG Consulting Group, LLC; \nJenn de la Vega\n, chef, stylist, cookbook author, trends expert, Randwiches; \nJonathan Deutsch\n, professor and director, Drexel Food Lab; \nJeanette Donnarumma\n, producer, cook, recipe developer/tester, food lover, content creator, party-planner; \nSarah Lohman\n, culinary historian, author, and public speaker; \nChef \nClara Park\n, claraparkcooks.com, chef, teacher, consultant and writer; \nWendy Robinson\n, program manager and senior buyer, Market Hall Foods; \nKantha Shelke\n, Ph.D., CFS, IFT Fellow, Corvus Blue LLC; \nCathy Strange\n, Ambassador of Food Culture, Whole Foods, \nV. \nSheree Williams\n, publisher, Cuisine Noir, and founder, Global Food and Drink Initiative.\n\n\nTop 5 Trends, 2024 Winter Fancy Food Show:\nPlant-Based Passport \nFlavor innovations abound as global comfort foods appeal to vegan and vegetarian audiences with plant-based ingredients. Said Trendspotter Clara Park of a plant-based spicy bulgogi spotted on the Show floor, \"The plant-based innovation on a very popular Korean beef dish allows more accessibility for diners. Vegetarians and vegans can now enjoy the flavor of Korean barbecue, hurray!\" Examples:\n\n\nAki Foods plant-based pork tonkotsu\n\n\nIbiden Bussan Co Ltd animal-free shrimp\n\n\nMasaru Foods plant-based tonkotsu broth\n\n\nJayone Foods plant-based spicy bulgogi\n\n\nPrime Roots x Three Little Pigs Black Truffle Koji-Pate\n\n\nSobo Foods Plant-Based \"Pork\" and Chive Dumpling\n\n\nSunday Supper Mozza Fritto\n\n\nXinca Foods Four Loroco and Cheese Pupusas\n\n\nYuzu \nJapanese citrus fruit yuzu was \"everywhere\" at the Winter Fancy Food Show, flavoring foods from a variety of categories, including drinks, ranch dressing, soy sauce, and candied dried fruit peels, said Trendspotter Jenn de la Vega. Added Park, \"Everyone loves lemon and citrus. But how you make it new again is with the Japanese citrus, yuzu.\" Examples:\n\n\nDomoto Food Yuzu Kosho\n\n\nKankitsu Labo Yuzu Sherbet\n\n\nMaeda-en Yuzu Sherbet\n\n\nMoshi Yuzu Sparkling Beverage\n\n\nUpcycled and Upscaled \nUgly fruits and byproducts that would otherwise end up in landfills are getting a glow-up in upcycled specialty products that have been further elevated by high-end packaging that looks good and is often sustainable. \"For upcycled brands, the packaging will ideally match the sustainability-focus of the product,\" said Trendspotter Jonathan Deutsch. \"As sustainable packaging gets more sophisticated and affordable, brands can align their better-for-the planet mission beyond the product to include the packaging.\" Examples:\n\n\nPressed Juicery Cold Pressed Juices\n\n\nRancho Meladuco California Grown Dates\n\n\nWheyward Spirit Whisky\n\n\nFruits as Snacks \nWhether enjoyed on their own, elevated with an indulgent ingredient, or used in an inventive way, nature's candies are breathing new life into snacking occasions. \"We're seeing a push away from highly processed foods and a return to fruit as snacks,\" said Trendspotter Deutsch. Examples:\n\n\nKankitsu Labu Dry Candied Citrus Peels\n\n\nLiko Lehua Guava Butter\n\n\nLolly's Frozen Grapes\n\n\nShizuoka Crown Melon\n\n\nSun World AUTUMNCRISP\n\u00ae\n Grapes\n\n\nNew Takes on Classics \nMany of the new products on the Fancy Food Show floor \"combine innovation with a classic twist,\" said Trendspotter Patsy Ramirez-Arroyo who cited Acme Smoked Fish Lox in a Box as an example. \"Taste the elegance of fancy Lunchables featuring smoked salmon, cream cheese, or avocado paired with crackers.\" Examples:\n\n\nCookies con Amore Glutenetto gluten-free cookies\n\n\nAcme Smoked Fish Lox in a Box\n\n\nTempesta Artisan Salumi Wagyu Pastrami\n\n\nUnha's Asian Snack Box Spicy Carbonara Tteokbokki\n\n\nWild Bill's Craft Beverage Co. Rocket Pop\n\n\nContinuing to Trend\nNon-Alcoholic Comes of Age \nSpirit-free cocktails and mixers with sophisticated flavor profiles in upscale vessels are elevating dry drinking occasions. \"Dry January used to be a thing, but more and more people are embracing the lifestyle behind the month and therefore restaurants and bars need to go beyond soft drinks,\" said Trendspotter V. \nSheree Williams\n. \"Tilden and a few other brands are trying to tap into this growing market with innovative flavors and textures that make the drinks go beyond juice.\" Examples:\n\n\nRSRV Collective Amari Kensho Cocktail\n\n\nMixly Cocktail Co. premium mixers\n\n\nTilden Tandem non-alcoholic cocktail\n\n\nNuanced Heat \n\"Consumers are getting a lot more nuanced when it comes to how they're using heat,\" said Deutsch. \"Do they want fruit-forward or roasted or spiced kind of heat? Now it's more about the nuance and the right chili pepper for the right product. I'm so happy manufacturers aren't dumbing down heat for mainstream Americans. I tasted some really spicy things and I think people are up to the task of trying them.\" Examples:\n\n\nChili Royale Hot Sichuan Sizzle Chili Crisp\n\n\nGrumpy Ginger Malaysian Red Curry Paste\n\n\nHot Mama Salsa Chili de Arbol Chili Oil\n\n\nKRS Garlic Chili Crisp\n\n\nTari Peruvian Everything Sauce\n\n\nMushrooms \n\"Mushrooms! Mushrooms! Mushrooms! An ancient clean label flavor booster for the specialty food aisle,\" said Trendspotter Kantha Shelke.\n\n\nHigh Country Fungus Magic Mocha, Magic Chai, and Magic Coco\n\n\nTerreland Shiitake Chips Wasabi\n\n\nKuze Fuku & Sons Matsutake Shoyu\n\n\nMeat the Mushroom SHROOMACON\n\n\nThese trends and more will be on full display at the 2024 Summer Fancy Food Show, which features thousands of specialty food and beverage products from around the world, educational and event programming, and networking opportunities.

        "summary": "New Zillow research suggests the spring home-shopping season may see a second wave if mortgage rates fall\n\nA Zillow analysis of 2023 home sales finds that homes listed in the first two weeks of June sold for 2.3% more.\n\nThe best time to list a home for sale is a month later than it was in 2019, a change likely driven by mortgage rates.\n\nThe best time to list can be as early as the second half of February in San Francisco , and as late as the first half of July in New York and Philadelphia.\n\nSEATTLE, March 7, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Spring home sellers looking to maximize their sale price may want to wait it out and list their home for sale in the first half of June. A new Zillow\u00ae analysis of 2023 sales found that homes listed in the first two weeks of June sold for 2.3% more, a $7,700 boost on a typical U.S. home.\n\nThe best time to list consistently had been early May in the years leading up to the pandemic . The shift to June suggests mortgage rates are strongly influencing demand on top of the usual seasonality that brings buyers to the market in the spring. This home-shopping season is poised to follow a similar pattern as that in 2023, with the potential for a second wave if the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates midyear or later.\n\nThe sale price premium registered last June followed the first spring in more than 15 years with mortgage rates over 6% on a 30-year fixed-rate loan. The high rates put home buyers on the back foot, and as rates continued upward through May, those prospective buyers were reassessing and less likely to bid boldly. In June, however, rates pulled back a little from 6.79% to 6.67% , which likely presented an opportunity for determined buyers heading into summer. More buyers understood their market position and could afford to transact, boosting competition and sale prices.\n\n\"The old logic was that sellers could earn a premium by listing in late spring when their home would be on the top of the pile of listings when search activity was at its peak. Now, with persistently low inventory, mortgage rate fluctuations make their own seasonality,\" said Zillow Chief Economist Skylar Olsen. \"First-time home buyers who are on the edge of qualifying for a home loan may dip in and out of the market, depending on what's happening with rates. It is almost certain the Federal Reserve will push back any interest-rate cuts to mid-2024 at the earliest. If mortgage rates follow, that could bring another surge of buyers later this year.\"\n\nMortgage rates have been impacting affordability and sale prices since they began rising rapidly two years ago. In 2022, sellers nationwide saw the highest sale premium when they listed their home in late March, right before rates barreled past 5% and continued climbing.\n\nZillow's research finds the best time to list can vary widely by metropolitan area. In 2023, it was as early as the second half of February in San Francisco, and as late as the first half of July in New York. Thirty of the top 35 largest metro areas saw for-sale listings command the highest sale prices between May and early July last year.\n\nZillow also found a wide range in the sale price premiums associated with homes listed during those peak periods. At the hottest time of the year in San Jose, homes sold for 5.5% more, a $88,000 boost on a typical home. Meanwhile, homes in San Antonio sold for 1.9% more during that same time period.\n\n\"Most sellers don't have the luxury of timing the market. The best time to list is when it makes the most sense for their lives,\" said Olsen. \"Regardless of the month, sellers who list their home for sale this spring can expect plenty of interest if their home is marketed and priced right. That's why it's more important than ever to hire a real estate agent with the experience to localize your strategy when comparable sales might be further afield. Harvesting near record home equity to support your next purchase or retirement is still possible.\"\n\nZillow data finds there are other unexpected ways to sell a home faster and for more money in today's market. These three tips can help:\n\nScreen appeal is the new curb appeal : A vast majority of buyers start their home search online. Sellers can make their listing stand out on Zillow by hiring an agent with a Listing Showcase subscription. It allows sellers to highlight their home's best features with larger, high-resolution photos, an AI-powered 3D home tour and interactive floor plan. Zillow data finds Listing Showcase listings receive 68% more page views, 66% more saves, 63% more shares and are 15% more likely to go pending in 14 days, compared to similar nearby non-Showcase listings.\n\n\n\n\n\n: A vast majority of buyers start their home search online.

Highlight the right features : Certain home features , when mentioned in a listing description, can signal to a buyer that a home is desirable and up-to-date. As a result, those features can help a home sell faster and for more money. Mentioning a steam oven or a pizza oven in a listing description can help a home sell for as much as 5.3% more, while a mention of a doorbell camera can help a home sell five days faster.\n\n\n\n\n\n: Certain , when mentioned in a listing description, can signal to a buyer that a home is desirable and up-to-date.

Make strategic improvements : Zillow research finds that most sellers make at least two improvements before listing their home for sale. Interior painting is one of the most common projects sellers take on. However, it pays to be strategic when picking paint colors. Zillow's latest paint color analysis finds homes with a charcoal gray kitchen can sell for about $2,500 more.\n\nMetropolitan Area Best Time to List Price Premium Dollar Boost United States First half of June 2.3 % $7,700 New York, NY First half of July 2.4 % $15,500 Los Angeles, CA First half of May 4.1 % $39,300 Chicago, IL First half of June 2.8 % $8,800 Dallas, TX First half of June 2.5 % $9,200 Houston, TX Second half of April 2.0 % $6,200 Washington, DC Second half of June 2.2 % $12,700 Philadelphia, PA First half of July 2.4 % $8,200 Miami, FL First half of June 2.3 % $12,900 Atlanta, GA Second half of June 2.3 % $8,700 Boston, MA Second half of May 3.5 % $23,600 Phoenix, AZ First half of June 3.2 % $14,700 San Francisco, CA Second half of February 4.2 % $50,300 Riverside, CA First half of May 2.7 % $15,600 Detroit, MI First half of July 3.3 % $7,900 Seattle, WA First half of June 4.3 % $31,500 Minneapolis, MN Second half of May 3.7 % $13,400 San Diego, CA Second half of April 3.1 % $29,600 Tampa, FL Second half of June 2.1 % $8,000 Denver, CO Second half of May 2.9 % $16,900 Baltimore, MD First half of July 2.2 % $8,200 St. Louis, MO First half of June 2.9 % $7,000 Orlando, FL First half of June 2.2 % $8,700 Charlotte, NC Second half of May 3.0 % $11,000 San Antonio, TX First half of June 1.9 % $5,400 Portland, OR Second half of April 2.6 % $14,300 Sacramento, CA First half of June 3.2 % $17,900 Pittsburgh, PA Second half of June 2.3 % $4,700 Cincinnati, OH Second half of April 2.7 % $7,500 Austin, TX Second half of May 2.8 % $12,600 Las Vegas, NV First half of June 3.4 % $14,600 Kansas City, MO Second half of May 2.5 % $7,300 Columbus, OH Second half of June 3.3 % $10,400 Indianapolis, IN First half of July 3.0 % $8,100 Cleveland, OH First half of July 3.4 % $7,400 San Jose, CA First half of June 5.5 % $88,400\n\n\n\n Zillow Group\n\nZillow Group, Inc.

(TSXV: NKG) (OTCQX: NKGFF) (\"Nevada King\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to provide an update on its Phase II resource expansion and definition drilling program at its 5,166 hectare (51.6km2), 100%-owned Atlanta Gold Mine Project, located in the prolific Battle Mountain Trend 264km northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada.\n\nHighlights:\n\nSince inception of the Phase II Atlanta drill program in June 2022 Nevada King has completed 391 holes totaling 76,249m , which includes 371 reverse-circulation (\"RC\") holes totaling 72,743m and 20 core holes totaling 3,506m . Prior to initiating the Phase II program the Company completed 68 holes totaling 5,544m in it's maiden Phase I program.\n\nTo date, as part of its Phase II program, Nevada King has reported assays from 254 holes covering 46,201m with results from 137 drill holes totaling 30,048m currently pending.\n\nThree RC rigs continue to operate at Atlanta . The core rig that began operating in October 2023 successfully completed six holes ( 1,258m ) needed for ongoing metallurgical testwork plus confirmation of RC drill results.\n\nA major objective of current drilling involves following up on elevated high-grade (>20 g/t Au) intercepts scattered throughout the deposit in order to further define the spatial distribution of this exceptionally high-grade mineralization for potential inclusion as discreet domains within a future resource model.\n\nDrilling is also ongoing in the North Extension Target to follow up on the high-grade oxide results released January 17, 2024 from an area 600m north of the Atlanta pit and well outside of the footprint of the existing resource, as well as at the southern end of the Atlanta resource zone following the blind discovery of thick, high-grade gold mineralization including 1.89 g/t Au over 114.3m and 2.15 g/t Au over 96.0m released on October 17, 2023 .\n\nCal Herron, Exploration Manager of Nevada King, commented, \"It has been a very busy winter so far with very few weather-related work stoppages, in part due to infrastructure improvements made in 2023. The core drill just completed its last metallurgical hole and has moved off-site, while three RC drills are still turning, two of them on a 24-hour schedule. Normally at this point in an exploration program's life, extensive drilling has resulted in a fairly complete and accurate understanding of a system's geology and potential. Atlanta is quite different \u2013 almost every new drill hole brings more twists and turns that keep our geologists (and drill crews) contantly changing gears and direction. We started out in 2021 hoping to get some shallow, low-grade hits south of the pit, while we've now graduated to hunting bonanza-grade pods along high-grade feeder structures scattered throughout the entire mineralized footprint. Looking forward in 2024, our drills will keep turning, and we eagerly await what comes next for the project.\"\n\nQA/QC Protocols\n\nAll RC samples from the Atlanta Project are split at the drill site and placed in cloth and plastic bags utilizing a nominal 2kg sample weight. CRF standards, blanks, and duplicates are inserted into the sample stream on-site on a one-in-twenty sample basis, meaning all three inserts are included in each 20-sample group. Samples are shipped by a local contractor in large sample shipping crates directly to American Assay Lab in Reno, Nevada, with full custody being maintained at all times. At American Assay Lab, samples were weighted then crushed to 75% passing 2mm and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns in order to produce a 300g pulverized split. Prepared samples are initially run using a four acid + boric acid digestion process and conventional mutli-element ICP-OES analysis. Gold assays are initially run using 30-gram samples by lead fire assay with an OES finish to a 0.003 ppm detection limit, with samples greater than 10 ppm finished gravimetrically. Every sample is also run through a cyanide leach for gold with an ICP-OES finish. The QA/QC procedure involves regular submission of Certified Analytical Standards and property-specific duplicates.\n\nQualified Person\n\nThe scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Calvin R.

Starting in 2016 the Company has staked large project areas hosting significant historical exploration work along the Battle Mountain trend located close to current or former producing gold mines. These project areas were initially targeted based on their potential for hosting multi-million-ounce gold deposits and were subsequently staked following a detailed geological evaluation. District-scale projects in Nevada King's portfolio include (1) the 100% owned Atlanta Mine, located 100km southeast of Ely, (2) the Lewis and Horse Mountain-Mill Creek projects, both located between Nevada Gold Mines' large Phoenix and Pipeline mines, and (3) the Iron Point project, located 35km east of Winnemucca, Nevada.\n\nThe Atlanta Mine is a historical gold-silver producer with a NI 43-101 compliant pit-constrained resource of 460,000 oz Au in the measured and indicated category (11.0M tonnes at 1.3 g/t) plus an inferred resource of 142,000 oz Au (5.3M tonnes at 0.83 g/t).

To help consumers make more informed home buying and selling decisions, Realtor.com\n\u00ae\n announces the launch of three new \nclimate risk factor scores\n on its website including Heat Factor\u2122, Wind Factor\u2122, and Air Factor\u2122, with data from \nFirst Street\n, a leading climate technology company with expertise in climate change and the connection of climate risk to financial risk.\n\n\n\"Realtor.com\n\u00ae\n currently offers users an in-depth look at fire and flood risks. When you consider the percentage of American homes, and the value at risk, against factors like extreme heat, air quality and wind, it was imperative for us to deliver more robust and comprehensive climate risk information to our users,\" said \nMausam Bhatt\n, Chief Product and Technology Officer, Realtor.com\n\u00ae\n. \"It's important for people to fully understand the climate risks that a home faces not only in the present, but in the future, so they can make the most informed decision for one of the biggest purchases and investments they will make in their life.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClimate Risk\n \n\n\nValue at Risk\n \n\n\nShare of Homes Affected\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtreme Heat \n \n\n\n$13.6 trillion\n \n\n\n32.5\u00a0%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtreme Wind\n \n\n\n$7.7 trillion\n \n\n\n18.1\u00a0%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAir Quality \n \n\n\n$6.6 trillion\n \n\n\n9.0\u00a0%\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u00a0\n\n\nRealtor.com\n\u00ae\n uses First Street's models that calculate property-level climate risk to present digestible, easy to understand information for its users. Home buyers and sellers can now more fully understand the climate risk associated with a property through maps illustrating exposure to risk factors. They can toggle between factors to see how a particular risk may affect the home's area in the present and over time, showing current exposure to risks and the expected change for each risk in 15 years, and in 30 years, the length of a typical mortgage.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n\nAcross the U.S., certain areas have more value at risk relative to specific climate factors. For example, \nMiami\n holds the highest total value of homes at risk for severe or extreme heat (valued at \n$1,258 billion\n) and wind (valued at \n$1,276 billion\n), while \nSan Francisco\n has the highest total value at risk of homes at severe or extreme air quality (valued at \n$1,455 billion\n). See more market level details \nhere\n.\u00a0\n\n\nMore Ways to Evaluate How Climate Risks May Affect Homes\u00a0 \n\n\n\n\nThrough Heat Factor\u2122\n, users can access property-level information that displays a heat risk score between 1-10 (minimal to extreme). They can see how many days the property area experiences a heat index (measured as temperature and humidity) at or above the local definition of a \"hot day\" and they can see the average high \"feels like\" temperature in the typical hottest month, today and 30 years into the future. In 2024, approximately 32.5% of homes in the U.S., valued at nearly \n$13.6 trillion\n, will face severe or extreme risk of heat exposure.\n\n\nWind Factor\u2122\n\u00a0assesses property-level risk measured as the chance a property will be exposed to wind gusts exceeding 50 mph at least once, and scores it from 1-10 (minimal to extreme), today and 30 years into the future. This year, approximately 18.1% of homes in the U.S., valued at nearly \n$7.7 trillion\n, will face severe or extreme risk of hurricane wind damage.\n\n\nAir Factor\u2122\n assigns a property-level air risk score from 1-10 (minimal to extreme) and shows consumers the expected change in poor air quality days (Air Quality Index over 100), today and 30 years into the future.\u00a0 Approximately 9.0% of homes in the U.S., valued at nearly \n$6.6 trillion\n, will face severe or extreme air quality risk in 2024.\n\n\n\n\nAccess to climate risk information including extreme heat, wind, and air quality are now available on for-sale homes listed on Realtor.com\n\u00ae\n and will be coming soon to rental properties.

        "summary": "Home Sales Rise, With Sellers Getting Almost Full Listing Price\n\n\nDENVER\n, \nMarch 19, 2024\n /PRNewswire/ -- With the annual spring\u00a0homebuying season coming quickly, home sales ramped up in February and spiked 17.0% from January, with a 2.3% increase from \nFebruary 2023\n. Of those sales, buyers paid more. The median home price of \n$412,000\n rose 2.1% from January \u2013 and 7.0% year over year. The \n$27,000\n increase from \nFebruary 2023\n reflected that buyers on average were willing to pay 99% of the listing price.\n\n\nIn a third of the markets of the 50 metros areas surveyed, buyers on average paid 98% or less, while in a quarter of the markets the average buyer paid 100% or more. At the current median sales price, 1% is equivalent to approximately \n$4,000\n.\n\n\nMeanwhile, inventory held relatively steady and dropped just 0.6% from January. Months supply of inventory (1.9) declined slightly from January's 2.1, but was up from last February's 1.6, and the number of homes for sale was 10.8% higher than a year ago.\n\n\nIn another indicator of increased demand, homes took an average of 44 days to sell in February \u2013 two days faster than January and one day faster than \nFebruary 2023\n.\n\n\n\"The February jump in sales activity illustrates the strength of demand in many markets. Buyers are out there looking for homes,\" said RE/MAX President \nAmy Lessinger\n. \"Investing in real estate is still one of the best ways to build wealth. As the market has continued to rebalance, both buyers and sellers seem to be adjusting their plans and making moves they may have had on hold for a while.\"\n\n\nTim Yee\n, a broker associate with RE/MAX Gold in the \nSan Francisco Bay Area\n also saw strong buyer demand and said prices remained remarkably stable. \"In San Francisco County, the list price to sales price ratio hovered around 100-106%, meaning buyers paid over asking price.

The Report is based on MLS data for the stated month in 50 metropolitan areas, includes single-family residential property types, and is not annualized. For maximum representation, most of the largest metro areas in the country are represented, and an attempt is made to include at least one metro area in almost every state. Metro areas are defined by the Core Based Statistical Areas (CBSAs) established by the U.S. Office of Management and Budget.\n\n\nDefinitions\nClosed Transactions are the total number of closed residential transactions during the given month. Months Supply of Inventory is the total number of residential properties listed for sale at the end of the month (current inventory) divided by the number of sales contracts signed (pending listings) during the month. Where \"pending\" data is unavailable, an inferred pending status is calculated using closed transactions. Days on Market is the average number of days that pass from the time a property is listed until the property goes under contract. Median Sales Price for a metro area is the median sales price for closed transactions in that metro area.\u00a0 The nationwide Median Sales Price is calculated at the nationwide aggregate level using all sale prices from the included metro areas.\u00a0 The Close-to-List Price Ratio is the average value of the sales price divided by the list price for each closed transaction.\n\n\nMLS data is provided by Seventy3, LLC, a RE/MAX Holdings company.

        "summary": "Flipping Activity by Investors Declines at Fastest Pace in 15 Years; Investment Returns on Flips Sink to Lowest Level Since 2007; Two-Thirds of Flipped Homes Still Purchased with Cash\nIRVINE, Calif., March 21, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- ATTOM, a leading curator of land, property, and real estate data, today released its year-end 2023 U.S. Home Flipping Report, which shows that 308,922 single-family homes and condos in the United States were flipped in 2023. That was down 29.3 percent from 436,807 in 2022 \u2013 the largest annual drop since 2008.\nThe report further reveals that as the number of homes flipped by investors declined, so did flips as a portion of all home sales, from 8.6 percent in 2022 to 8.1 percent last year.\nIn yet another sign of down times for the home-flipping industry, profits and profit margins also sank on quick buy-renovate-and-resell projects.\nGross profits on typical home flips in 2023 dropped to $66,000 nationwide (the difference between the median sales price and the median amount originally paid by investors). That was down from $70,100 in 2022 and translated into just a 27.5 percent return on investment compared to the original acquisition price. The latest nationwide ROI (before accounting for mortgage interest, property taxes, renovation expenses and other holding costs) was down from 28.1 percent in 2022 and 35.7 percent in 2021, hitting the worst level since 2007.\nInvestors saw their profit margins decrease for the sixth time in the past seven years as the median price of the homes they flipped dipped slightly faster than the median price they had paid to purchase properties \u2013 4.4 percent versus 4 percent.\n\"In 2023, the landscape for home flipping across the U.S. became increasingly challenging,\" remarked Rob Barber, CEO at ATTOM. \"Whether the overall market has soared or seen just modest gains in recent years, investors have missed out on the action.\"\nHe added that \"the sharp decline in the number of home flips likely reflected a combination of a tight supply of homes for sale as well as dwindling returns. Either way, it will take some significant reworking of the financials for home flipping fortunes to turn back around.\"\nThe latest drop-off in home-flipping profits came during a year when the nation's decade-long home-price runup began to stall, leading to the weakest annual price gains since 2012 and a slight dip in profits for sellers of all kinds. But margins for home flippers had already been declining during earlier years when the broader housing market was booming. As that happened, the profit gap between investors and all sellers gradually widened.\nTypical returns in 2023 remained at levels that could easily be wiped out by the carrying costs during the renovation and repair process, which usually consume 20 to 33 percent of the resale price.\nHome flipping rates fall in most housing markets, with biggest decreases in the South and West\nHome flips as a portion of all home sales decreased from 2022 to 2023 in 112 of the 212 metropolitan statistical areas analyzed in the report (53 percent). The top 25 largest decreases in annual flipping rates all were in the South and West. They were led by Gainesville, GA (rate down from 15.1 percent in 2022 to 9.9 percent in 2023); Phoenix, AZ (down from 16.3 percent to 11.9 percent); Prescott, AZ (down from 9.8 percent to 6 percent); Charlotte, NC (down from 14.2 percent to 10.6 percent) and Provo, UT (down from 10.9 percent to 7.5 percent).\nAside from Phoenix and Charlotte, the biggest decreases in flipping rates from 2022 to 2023 in metro areas with a population of 1 million or more were in Las Vegas, NV (rate down from 12.2 percent to 8.9 percent); Sacramento, CA (down from 9.9 percent to 6.9 percent) and Tucson, AZ (down from 14.6 percent to 11.8 percent).\nMetro areas where home flipping rates increased from 2022 to 2023 were led by Macon, GA (rate up from 12.1 percent to 17 percent); Gulfport, MS (up from 3.9 percent to 7.7 percent); Jackson, MS (up from 5.8 percent to 8.4 percent); Columbus, GA (up from 10.9 percent to 13.5 percent) and Dayton, OH (up from 10 percent to 12.4 percent).\nHome flips purchased with financing tick upward\nNationally, the percentage of flipped homes originally purchased by investors with financing increased in 2023 to 36.5 percent, up from 35.7 percent in 2022 and from 36.2 percent in 2021.\nMeanwhile, 63.5 percent of homes flipped in 2023 were originally bought with cash only, down from 64.3 percent in 2022 and from 63.8 percent two years earlier.\nAmong metropolitan areas with a population of 1 million or more and sufficient data to analyze, those with the highest percentage of flipped homes purchased by investors with financing in 2023 included San Diego, CA (56.4 percent); Seattle, WA (56.1 percent); Fresno, CA (52.2 percent); Providence, RI (49.2 percent) and Boston, MA (48.6 percent).\nIn that same group, the metro areas with the highest percentage of flips purchased with all cash included Detroit, MI (81.6 percent); Cleveland, OH (76.3 percent); Buffalo, NY (75.5 percent); Pittsburgh, PA (71.1 percent) and Birmingham, AL (70.2 percent).\nTypical gross profits on home flips decline in nearly two-thirds of nation\nHomes flipped in 2023 were sold for a median price nationwide of $306,000, generating a gross flipping profit of $66,000 above the median original purchase price paid by investors of $240,000. That national gross-profit figure was down from $70,100 in 2022 and from $75,000 in 2021, which was the highest level this century.\nAmong the 56 metro areas in the U.S. with a population of 1 million or more, those with the largest gross flipping profits on median-priced transactions in 2023 were San Jose, CA ($275,250); San Francisco, CA ($170,000); Boston, MA ($158,000); New York, NY ($154,750) and San Diego, CA ($153,000).\nThe weakest gross flipping profits among metro areas with a population of at least 1 million in 2023 were in Austin, TX ($18,640 loss); San Antonio, TX ($12,289 profit); Dallas, TX ($14,817 profit); Houston, TX ($16,932 profit) and Phoenix, AZ ($25,000 profit).\nHome flipping returns fall in two-thirds of metro-area markets\nThe profit margin on the typical home flips in the U.S. last year fell to 27.5 percent - the smallest investment return since 2007. The ROI on median-priced home flips nationwide has dropped 18 percentage points since 2020 and is off by 27 points since 2016.\nMargins fell again last year as the median nationwide resale price on flipped homes went down 4.4 percent, from $320,000 in 2022 to $306,000 in 2023. That represented a slightly larger decrease than the 4 percent dip in the price investors had originally paid for properties they flipped ($249,900 in 2022 versus $240,000 in 2023).\nAmong metro areas with a population of 1 million or more, the biggest percentage-point decreases in profit margins during 2023 were in Pittsburgh, PA (ROI down from 149.8 percent in 2022 to 105.3 percent in 2023); Buffalo, NY (down from 125.2 percent to 87.4 percent); Oklahoma City, OK (down from 57.6 percent to 43.7 percent); Richmond, VA (down from 88.3 percent to 75.1 percent) and Austin, TX (down from a 9 percent profit to a 4.1 percent loss).\nIn that same group of markets with populations of at least 1 million, the largest increases in returns on investment for typical home flips came in Cincinnati, OH (ROI up from 40.5 percent in 2022 to 59.6 percent in 2023); Cleveland, OH (up from 39.5 percent to 54.7 percent in 2023); Honolulu, HI (up from 15.3 percent to 27 percent); Sacramento, CA (up from 9.5 percent to 19.6 percent) and Hartford, CT (up from 48.5 percent to 56.4 percent).\nAmong metro areas with a population of at least 1 million, the biggest gross profit margins in 2023 were in Pittsburgh, PA (105.3 percent); Buffalo, NY (87.4 percent); Baltimore, MD (75.5 percent); Richmond, VA (75.1 percent) and Philadelphia, PA (74.3 percent). The worst came in Austin TX (4.1 percent loss); Dallas, TX (4.4 percent profit); San Antonio, TX (5 percent profit); Salt Lake City, UT (6.2 percent profit) and Houston, TX (6.2 percent profit).\nAverage time to flip nationwide increases\nHome flippers who sold homes in 2023 took an average of 169 days, or about 5 \u00bd months, to complete the flips. That was up from 165 days for homes flipped in 2022 and 158 days in 2021.\nU.S. Average Days to Flip\nFHA buyers purchase larger portion of flipped homes\nOf the 308,922 U.S. homes flipped in 2023, 10.8 percent, or one of every nine, were sold to buyers using a loan backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). That was up from 8.3 percent in 2022, or one in 12, and from 8.1 percent in 2021.\nAmong the 212 metro areas with a population of at least 200,000 and at least 100 home flips in 2023, those with the highest percentage of flipped homes sold in 2023 to FHA buyers \u2014 typically first-time homebuyers \u2014 were Merced, CA (29.3 percent); Modesto, CA (25 percent); Visalia, CA (24.7 percent); Bakersfield, CA (24.6 percent) and Kennewick, WA (23.7 percent).\nNearly 200 counties had a home flipping rate of at least 10 percent in 2023\nAmong 866 counties with at least 50 home flips in 2023, there were 198 where flips accounted for at least 10 percent of all home sales last year. The top five were all in Georgia: Cobb County (Marietta) (22.4 percent); Bibb County (Macon) (18.6 percent); Douglas County (outside Atlanta) (18.4 percent); Houston County (Warner Robins) (18 percent) and Clayton County (outside Atlanta) (17.2 percent).\nHigh-level takeaways from fourth-quarter 2023 data:\nThe 65,656 home flips in the fourth quarter of 2023 were completed by 52,701 investors, a ratio of 1.25 flips per investor.\nThe share of homes flipped in the fourth quarter of 2023 that were purchased by investors with financing represented 36.1 percent of all homes flipped in the quarter, down from 37.2 percent in the previous quarter but up from 34.4 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. The share purchased with cash rose to 63.9 percent, up from 62.8 percent in the third quarter of 2023 but down from 65.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nThe gross-flipping profit on median-priced home flips in the fourth quarter of 2023 was $65,000, down from $68,154 in the third quarter but up from $59,900 in the fourth quarter of 2022. The latest figure represented a typical 27.7 percent return on investment (percentage of original purchase price). That was down from 28.8 percent in the previous quarter but up from 24.4 percent in the same period of 2022.\nThe quarterly decrease in the ROI \u2013 common during that time period each year - followed gains in the second and third quarters of 2023.\nHome flips completed in the fourth quarter of 2023 took an average of 156 days, down from 165 days in the fourth quarter of 2022.\nReport methodology\nATTOM analyzed sales deed data for this report. A single-family home or condo flip was any arms-length transaction that occurred in the quarter where a previous arms-length transaction on the same property had occurred within the last 12 months. The average gross flipping profit is the difference between the purchase price and the flipped price (not including rehab costs and other expenses incurred, which flipping veterans estimate typically run between 20 percent and 33 percent of a property's after-repair value). Gross flipping return on investment was calculated by dividing the gross flipping profit by the first sale (purchase) price.\nAbout ATTOM\nATTOM provides premium property data to power products that improve transparency, innovation, efficiency, and disruption in a data-driven economy.

(TSXV: NKG) (OTCQX: NKGFF) (\"Nevada King\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce results from seven vertical, reverse circulation (\"RC\") holes completed in the northern portion of the West Atlanta Graben Zone (\"WAGZ\") at its 5,166 hectare (51.6km2), 100% owned Atlanta Gold Mine Project, located in the prolific Battle Mountain Trend 264km northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. Today's holes are plotted on plan and section on Figures 1 and 2 below.\n\nHighlights:\n\nFigure 1.

AT23WS-62 did fully penetrate the mineralized zone and returned an average grade three times greater than DHRI-12-MRC1. Referring to Figure 2, AT23WS-62 drilled across a high-angle structure into an adjacent mineralized block, which accounts for the shorter intercept length when compared to DHRI-12-MRC1.\n\n\n\n\n\nintercepted and was drilled approximately of the Atlanta Pit approximately west of historical RC hole DHRI-12-MRC1 (1.95g/t Au over ), which did not completely penetrate the mineralized zone. AT23WS-62 did fully penetrate the mineralized zone and returned an average grade three times greater than DHRI-12-MRC1. Referring to Figure 2, AT23WS-62 drilled across a high-angle structure into an adjacent mineralized block, which accounts for the shorter intercept length when compared to DHRI-12-MRC1. The very high-grade interval in AT23WS-62 (19.44 g/t Au over 7.6m ) may correlate to another sub-vertical high-grade feeder structure and its cross-cutting of a near horizontal receptive stratigraphic unit similar to the interpreted zone recently reported along Section 22-8N(3) in which hole AT23NS-174 intercepted 19.2 g/t Au over 10.7m (released February 6, 2024 ).\n\n\n\n\n\n) may correlate to another sub-vertical high-grade feeder structure and its cross-cutting of a near horizontal receptive stratigraphic unit similar to the interpreted zone recently reported along Section 22-8N(3) in which hole AT23NS-174 intercepted 19.2 g/t Au over (released ). Eastward from AT23WS-62, holes AT23WS-45 ( 61.0m @ 3.52 g/t Au), AT22WS-2 ( 71.7m @ 2.31 g/t Au), and AT23WS-60 ( 97.5m @ 1.04 g/t Au) display a gradual eastward decrease in grade within this 100m -wide portion of the WAGZ between the West Atlanta #2 and West Atlanta #1 Faults (see Figure 2), with mineralized thicknesses remaining relatively uniform. This lateral continuity in mineralization is also observed along previously reported lines to the south and appears to be characteristic of grade distribution within the WAGZ.\n\n\n\n\n\n@ 3.52 g/t Au), AT22WS-2 ( @ 2.31 g/t Au), and AT23WS-60 ( @ 1.04 g/t Au) display a gradual eastward decrease in grade within this -wide portion of the WAGZ between the #2 and #1 Faults (see Figure 2), with mineralized thicknesses remaining relatively uniform. This lateral continuity in mineralization is also observed along previously reported lines to the south and appears to be characteristic of grade distribution within the WAGZ. Gold mineralization along Section 22-16N(2) now extends approximately 340m east-west, and remains open to the west and to the north from this area toward the North Extension Target (\"NET\"). Hole AT23WS-63 at the west end of the section returned 1.18 g/t Au over 27.4m but was lost in an open void before drilling deep enough to intersect the projected higher-grade zone and consequently must be re-drilled. The Company is currently drilling north of Section 22-16N(2) in order to connect the WAGZ with the NET.\n\nCal Herron, Exploration Manager of Nevada King, stated, \"The north end of the WAGZ is becoming strikingly similar to the southern end, where we see good lateral continuity of mineralization across a 100m to 150m-wide, fairly flat-lying horizon measuring from 50m to over 100m thick. As we continue testing for similar mineralization along lines north and south of Section 22-16N(2), good potential exists for building tonnage. The presence of the high-grade intercept in AT23WS-62 (19.44 g/t Au over 7.6m) raises the possibility of encountering additional zones of elevated high-grade mineralization within the immediate vicinity that could also impact the overall grade of the WAGZ.\n\n\"Drilling is now underway north of today's holes and is oriented to potentially connect the northern end of the WAGZ with the southern end of the NET. If successful, connecting these zones would significantly enlarge a growing mineralized area at Atlanta that is located well north of the existing Gustavson 2020 resource boundary. Concurrently, on-going exploratory drilling continues to concentrate on further expansion of the resource zone together with upgrading of Au/Ag mineralization along major structures and at structural intersections along the AMFZ and within the WAGZ.\"\n\nHole No. From (m)  Interval (m) Au (g/t) Ag (g/t) AT23WS-42 312.5 341.5 29.0 2.03 13.9 AT23WS-45 263.7 324.7 61.0 3.52 15.7 Includes 280.5 291.2 10.7 7.55 36.3 AT23WS-57* 306.3 340.0 33.7 0.14 12.37 AT23WS-60 240.2 301.8 97.5 1.04 4.9 AT23WS-62 291.1 332.2 41.1 6.05 25.0 Includes 294.1 301.8 7.6 19.44 21.6 AT23WS-63* 309.4 336.8 27.4 1.18 18.3 AT23NS-149 175.3 192.1 16.8 0.46 10.14 Table 2.

Samples are shipped by a local contractor in large sample shipping crates directly to American Assay Lab in Reno, Nevada, with full custody being maintained at all times. At American Assay Lab, samples were weighted then crushed to 75% passing 2mm and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns in order to produce a 300g pulverized split. Prepared samples are initially run using a four acid + boric acid digestion process and conventional mutli-element ICP-OES analysis. Gold assays are initially run using 30-gram samples by lead fire assay with an OES finish to a 0.003 ppm detection limit, with samples greater than 10 ppm finished gravimetrically. Every sample is also run through a cyanide leach for gold with an ICP-OES finish. The QA/QC procedure involves regular submission of Certified Analytical Standards and property-specific duplicates.\n\nQualified Person\n\nThe scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Calvin R.

        "summary": "Residential Loans Drop Another 14 Percent; \nPurchase, Refinance and Home-Equity Lending All Decline\n\n\nIRVINE, Calif.\n, \nFeb. 29, 2024\n /PRNewswire/ -- \nATTOM\n, a leading curator of land, property, and\u00a0\nreal estate data\n, today released its fourth-quarter 2023 U.S. Residential Property Mortgage Origination Report, which shows that 1.35 million mortgages secured by residential property (1 to 4 units) were issued in \nthe United States\n during the fourth quarter, representing a 13.8 percent decline from the prior quarter. The drop-off marked the tenth in the last 11 quarters.\n\n\nThe fourth-quarter fallback left total residential lending activity down 16.5 percent from a year earlier and 67.7 percent from a high point hit in the first quarter of 2021. It came amid another period of elevated home prices and mortgage rates along with low supplies of homes for sale.\n\n\nOngoing declines in lending activity during the fourth quarter resulted from losses in all major categories of residential lending. Purchase-loan activity went down another 18.4 percent quarterly, to about 618,000, while refinance deals slumped 7.9 percent, to 488,000. Home-equity credit lines sank 12.7 percent, to 241,000.\n\n\nMeasured monetarily, lenders issued \n$417.4 billion\n worth of residential mortgages in the fourth quarter of 2023. That was down 14.9 percent from the third quarter of 2023 and 18.6 percent from the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\nThe different pace of change among various loan types helped raise\u00a0the portion of all residential mortgages represented by refinance packages back above one-third, although that level remained far less than where it was three years ago before interest rates started to climb above historically low levels. Purchase loans continued to slip back below half of all mortgages but were still the most common form of mortgage. Home-equity loans dipped further below 20 percent of all activity.\n\n\n\"Multiple powerful forces continued to conspire against the mortgage industry during the fourth quarter, slicing back huge portions of their business,\" said \nRob Barber\n, CEO at ATTOM. \"There were signs during the peak buying season of 2022 that things were starting to turn around, with increases in purchase, refinance and HELOC deals. That could happen again this year as we head into this year's peak period, especially with interest rates coming down recently. But the fourth-quarter numbers revealed continued gloomy times for lenders, no matter how you sliced the pie.\"\n\n\nHome-mortgage lending took another fall at the end of 2023 as average interest rates for 30-year fixed loans rose to between 7 percent and 8 percent. That further drove up home ownership costs at a time when record home prices in most of the country already were unaffordable, or a significant financial stretch, for average wage earners. Purchase lending took an additional hit from low supplies of homes for sale that helped reduce the number of properties available for potential mortgages.\n\n\nTotal lending activity down in more than 90 percent of nation\u00a0\nBanks and other lenders issued a total of 1,346,479 residential mortgages in the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 1,562,600 in the third quarter of 2023. The fallback resumed a nearly three-year run of declines that was broken only by a spike in the second quarter of last year.\n\n\nThe latest total also was down annually from 1,612,777 in the fourth quarter of 2022, and from a recent high point of 4,164,755 hit three years ago.\n\n\nA total of \n$417.4 billion\n was lent to homeowners and buyers in the fourth quarter, which was down from \n$490.3 billion\n in the prior quarter and down from \n$512.7 billion\n in the fourth quarter of 2022. The latest figure stood at barely more than one-third of the recent quarterly peak of \n$1.29 trillion\n hit in the second quarter of 2021.\n\n\nOverall lending activity dipped lower from the third to the fourth quarter of last year in 184, or 96 percent, of the 191 metropolitan statistical areas around the U.S. that had a population of 200,000 or more and at least 1,000 total residential mortgages issued from October through December of 2023.\n\n\nTotal lending also remained down from the fourth quarter of 2022 in 183, or 96 percent, of the metro areas analyzed. It was off by at least 15 percent annually in slightly more than half of those markets.\n\n\nThe largest quarterly decreases were in \nAnchorage, AK\n (total lending down 45.3 percent from the third quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2023); \nSt. Louis, MO\n (down 42 percent); \nCharleston, SC\n (down 33.5 percent); \nRochester, NY\n (down 31.5 percent) and \nSouth Bend, IN\n (down 25.7 percent).\n\n\nAside from \nSt. Louis\n and \nRochester\n, metro areas with a population of least 1 million that had the biggest decreases in total loans from the third quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2023 were \nRaleigh, NC\n (down 22.6 percent); \nPortland, OR\n (down 22.1 percent) and \nDenver, CO\n (down 21.8 percent).\n\n\nThe biggest quarterly increase, or the smallest decreases, among metro areas with a population of at least 1 million came in \nBuffalo, NY\n (total lending up 19 percent from the third to the fourth quarter of 2023); \nAtlanta, GA\n (down 3 percent); \nWashington, DC\n (down 3.6 percent); \nOrlando, FL\n (down 5.2 percent) and \nFresno, CA\n (down 5.7 percent).\n\n\nRefinance mortgage originations down after two straight gains\nLenders issued 487,671 residential refinance mortgages in the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 529,683 in the third quarter. The fallback followed increases in the prior two quarters.\n\n\nThe latest figure was down 5.3 percent from 514,915 in the fourth quarter of 2022 and was 82.2 percent less than a peak of 2,742,931 reached in early 2021.\n\n\nThe \n$146.2 billion dollar\n volume of refinance packages in the fourth quarter of 2023 was down 7 percent from \n$157.2 billion\n in the third quarter and 13.6 percent from \n$169.3 billion\n in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\nRefinancing activity shrank quarterly in 157, or 82 percent, of the 191 metro areas around the U.S. with enough data to analyze. It was down annually in 123, or 64 percent, of those metros.\n\n\nThe largest quarterly decreases were in \nAnchorage, AK\n (refinance loans down 46.9 percent from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2023); \nSt. Louis, MO\n (down 39.2 percent); \nSouth Bend, IN\n (down 35 percent); \nRochester, NY\n (down 31.5 percent) and \nSpringfield, IL\n (down 25.4 percent).\n\n\nAside from \nSt. Louis\n and \nRochester\n, metro areas with a population of least 1 million where refinance activity decreased most from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2023 were \nMemphis, TN\n (down 23 percent); \nRaleigh, NC\n (down 21.7 percent) and \nTulsa, OK\n (down 17.1 percent).\n\n\nMetro areas with a population of least 1 million and the largest increases in the number of refinance loans from the third quarter to the fourth quarter of 2023 were \nBuffalo, NY\n (up 25.9 percent); \nWashington, DC\n (up 16.3 percent); \nLas Vegas, NV\n (up 11.8 percent); \nBaltimore, MD\n (up 6.7 percent) and \nSan Diego, CA\n (up 6.2 percent).\n\n\nRefinance packages comprised 36.2 percent of all loan originations in the fourth quarter of 2023. That was up from 33.9 percent in the prior quarter and from 31.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022, although still far less than the 65.9 percent portion in the first quarter of 2021.\n\n\nPurchase mortgages dip again throughout U.S. after a brief surge\nLoans issued to home buyers fell back in the last few months of 2023 for the second straight quarter after a surge of nearly 30 percent in the Spring of last year.\n\n\nThe latest total of 618,244 was down from 757,366 in the third quarter of 2023. It was also down 20.2 percent from 774,493 a year earlier and almost 60 percent from a high point hit in the Spring of 2021.\n\n\nThe \n$227.6 billion dollar\n volume of purchase loans in the fourth quarter of 2023 was down 20.1 percent from \n$284.7 billion\n in the third quarter and 18.9 percent from \n$280.6 billion\n in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\nResidential purchase-mortgage originations decreased quarterly in 183 of the 191 metro areas in the report (96 percent) and annually in 93 percent of those markets.\n\n\nThe largest quarterly decreases were in \nSioux Falls, SD\n (purchase loans down 66.8 percent from the third to the fourth quarter of 2023); \nSt. Louis, MO\n (down 46.2 percent); \nAnchorage, AK\n (down 44.1 percent); \nBirmingham, AL\n (down 40 percent) and \nCharleston, SC\n (down 39.3 percent).\n\n\nHome-purchase borrowing comprised 45.9 percent of all loan originations in the fourth quarter of 2023, down from 48.5 percent in the prior quarter and 48 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022. But the latest level was still way up from 29.6 percent in early 2021 when refinance deals were dominating the lending business.\n\n\nHELOC lending also falls in most markets\nHome-equity lines of credit (HELOCs) also decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023, declining to 240,564 from 275,551 in the third quarter. The latest figure was down 25.6\u00a0percent from 323,369 a year earlier. The latest decrease marked the second in a row after a brief uptick last Spring.\n\n\nThe \n$43.6 billion\n volume of HELOC loans in the fourth quarter of 2023 was down from \n$48.4 billion\n in the third quarter, a 9.8 percent decline. The latest level also was down annually, by 30.6 percent.\n\n\nHELOCs comprised 17.9 percent of all loans in the most recent quarter. That was down from 20.1 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022 but still four times the level recorded in the early part of 2021.\n\n\nHELOC mortgage originations decreased from the third quarter of 2023 to the fourth quarter of 2023 in 87 percent of the metro areas analyzed. The largest quarterly decreases in metro areas with a population of at least 1 million were in \nHonolulu, HI\n (down 36.3 percent from the third to the fourth quarter of 2023); \nSt. Louis, MO\n (down 34.3 percent); \nRochester, NY\n (down 31.6 percent); \nNew Orleans, LA\n (down 23.9 percent) and \nMilwaukee, WI\n (down 22.7 percent).\n\n\nThe largest quarterly increases in HELOC activity in metro areas with a population of at least 1 million and sufficient data to analyze came in \nKansas City, MO\n (up 15.4 percent); \nDallas, TX\n (up 6.7 percent); \nSan Diego, CA\n (up 6.4 percent); \nHouston, TX\n (up 5.2 percent) and \nWashington, DC\n (up 4.9 percent).\n\n\nFHA loan portions go up again while VA lending decreases\nMortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) rose as a percentage of all lending for the ninth straight quarter. They accounted for 211,184, or 15.7 percent, of all residential property loans originated in the fourth quarter of 2023. That was up from 15.1 percent in the third quarter of 2023 and 11.9 percent in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\nResidential loans backed by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) totaled 58,931, or 4.4 percent, of all residential property loans originated in the fourth quarter of 2023. That was the down from 4.8 percent in the previous quarter and from 5.3 percent a year earlier.\n\n\nPurchase loan amounts and down payment percentages both decline\nAs the national median home price decreased in the fourth quarter of 2023, typical single-family home loan amounts and median down-payment percentages also ticked lower.\n\n\nAmong homes purchased with financing in the fourth quarter of 2023, the median loan amount was \n$305,900\n. That was down 4.1 percent from \n$319,113\n in the prior quarter, although still up annually by 1.7 percent, from \n$300,700\n.\n\n\nThe median down payment of \n$32,500\n on single-family homes purchased with financing in the fourth quarter of 2023 also was down, by 7.1 percent, from \n$35,000\n in the third quarter of 2023. The latest figure represented 9 percent of the median home price, down slightly from 9.2 percent in the third quarter but unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\n\nReport methodology\nATTOM analyzed recorded mortgage and deed of trust data for single-family homes, condos, town homes and multi-family properties of two to four units for this report. Each recorded mortgage or deed of trust was counted as a separate loan origination. Dollar volume was calculated by multiplying the total number of loan originations by the average loan amount for those loan originations.\n\n\n ATTOM\nATTOM\n\u00a0provides premium\u00a0\nproperty data\n\u00a0to power products that improve transparency, innovation, efficiency, and disruption in a data-driven economy.

        "summary": "New listings are up 21% annually, evidence of rate lock easing\n\n\nNew listings rose annually in every major metro.\n\n\nTotal inventory rose 12% year over year; the largest gains came in the South.\n\n\nCompetition is stiff for attractive listings; homes went pending in just 17 days nationwide.\n\n\nSEATTLE\n, \nMarch 14, 2024\n /PRNewswire/ -- An infusion of new inventory into the market is welcome news for buyers on the hunt for their next home this spring. It's also more evidence that the effects of \"rate lock\" on homeowners are starting to weaken, according to the \nlatest monthly report\n1\n\u00a0from Zillow\u00ae.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"For more than a year, \nZillow homeowner surveys\n have shown an elevated share of homeowners expecting to sell in the next three years. We're finally beginning to see owners who have been putting off moves return to the market,\" said \nSkylar Olsen\n, chief economist at Zillow. \"For many households with record-high equity, waiting out potentially lower rates later in the year may not be worth it.\"\n \nMore choices for buyers\nBuyers are seeing more choices on the market, which should help spur sales this spring.\n\n\nNew listings of existing homes on Zillow are up 21% in February compared to last year, and rose 20% from January. The rising tide of new listings was universal; counts are up annually in each of the 50 largest U.S. metros. They're coming on strongest in the South, especially \nTexas\n and \nFlorida\n. Substantial new construction in these areas is likely helping to give existing homeowners somewhere to move to, freeing up existing inventory.\nTotal inventory is increasing significantly as well, up 12% nationally compared to last year. At just over 900,000, there were more homes for sale in February than in any February since 2020. Annual increases are highest in \nDallas\n (up 39%), \nTampa\n (31%), \nOrlando\n (30%) and \nMiami\n (29%).\nStiff competition for attractive listings\nDespite February's supply increase, competition remains strong for attractive, well-priced listings. Homes that went under contract in February typically did so after 17 days \u2014 that's slower than during the rate-fueled frenzy of 2021 and 2022, but far faster than before the pandemic.\nAspirationally priced listings, or those lacking real or virtual curb appeal, are lingering on the market. The average time on Zillow for all homes was 53 days, which is longer than normal for this time of year.\nPrice cuts are more common than normal \u2014 1 in 5 listings on Zillow are seeing cuts \u2014 as sellers bring their expectations closer to where buyers can meet them. Most sellers will have plenty of cushion to absorb a price cut and come out ahead from when they bought their home. Typical home values are up from last year in all but three major metros, and values have risen 41% nationwide since before the pandemic.\nHousing costs continue to climb\nThe typical home in the \nU.S\n. is worth \n$349,216\n, according to the \nZillow\n Home Value Index \u2014 up 40.8% compared to before the pandemic. Monthly gains were largest in expensive coastal metros: \nSan Jose\n (1.6%), \nSan Diego\n (1.3%), \nSeattle\n (1.2%), \nSan Francisco\n (0.8%) and \nWashington\n, \nD.C\n. (0.8%).\nMortgage rates rose\n\u00a0in February, helping bump the cost of a mortgage on a typical home 9.4% higher than last year. That has changed the math for home buyers, who now \nneed to earn about 80% more\n than in 2020, and are more often \npartnering with friends and family\n or \n\"house hacking\"\n their way to homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetropolitan Area*\n \n\n\nFebruary Zillow Home Value Index (ZHVI) \n(Raw)\n \n\n\nZHVI Change, Year overYear \n(YoY)\n \n\n\n \n\n\nChange in Days to Pending

        "summary": "VANCOUVER, BC, March 26, 2024 /PRNewswire/ - Nevada King Gold Corp. (TSXV: NKG) (OTCQX: NKGFF) (\" Nevada King\" or the \" Company\") is pleased to report results from an extensive Phase I metallurgical testing program at the Atlanta Gold Mine Project, located in the prolific Battle Mountain Trend, 264km northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada. The objective of the Phase I program was to test the various mineralized host rocks at Atlanta for gold and silver extraction, using conventional flowsheet unit operations to guide in selecting a process flowsheet suitable for the commercial extraction of gold and silver from the project. Results of the Phase I test work support strong recoveries utilizing conventional Nevada oxide processing methods for the representative mineralization types present at Atlanta.\nHighlights:\nPhase I testing used three surface bulk samples and 19 composites from drill core comprising the full range of rock types and gold and silver grades encountered across Atlanta. Mineralization at Atlanta can be broadly characterized by two major host domains: 1) Silicified breccias found within and below the main Atlanta unconformity, and 2) Volcanics found above the main Atlanta unconformity (refer to cross sections A-A and B-B in Figures 3-4 below).\nResults of Phase I support conventional Nevada oxide processing methods for Atlanta whereby:\nSilicified breccias are amenable to conventional milling for high-grade material and High-Pressure Grinding Roll (\" HPGR\") crushing and heap leaching for the lower-grade material.\nVolcanics are amenable to conventional milling for high-grade material and Conventional Crush or Run-of-Mine (\" ROM\") heap leaching for the lower-grade material.\nApplicable to process plant scenarios, gold extraction from fine milling at a 200-mesh grind (P80=75\u00b5m) show a weighted average extraction of 91.7% for gold hosted in volcanics and 85.9% for the high-grade silica breccias.\nSilver extraction from fine milling at a 200-mesh grind (P80=75\u00b5m) show a weighted average 65.3% in the volcanics and 41.3% in the silica breccias. At coarser crush size silver extractions are similar between the two metallurgical domains.\nApplicable to heap leach scenarios, gold extraction from conventional crushing (P80=12.5 mm) shows a weighted average extraction of 87.1% for gold hosted in volcanics. Gold extraction from HPGR crushed composites (using medium press force) shows a weighted average 71.4% extraction from low-grade silica breccias.\nA Phase 2 metallurgical PQ core drilling program has now been completed to fill some gaps in the target resource envelope and further laboratory testing utilizing material from this drilling is scheduled to start later in 2024. The location of these holes can be found in the drill hole plan map below in Figure 2.\nBulk Sample and Phase 1 metallurgical test work at Atlanta has been supervised by Gary Simmons (MMSA QP Number: 01013QP), formerly the Director of Metallurgy and Technology for Newmont Mining Corp. Mr. Simmons has supervised and managed numerous Carlin-style metallurgical testing programs in the Great Basin with characteristics similar to those found at Atlanta.\nMr. Simmons commented, \"Historic production at Atlanta focused on near-surface high-grade silica breccia ores that were processed and recovered using conventional oxide milling practices. Historical records (1979-85) indicate recoveries from the silica breccias necessitated a fine-grind milling and Merrill-Crowe recovery process that averaged 81% for gold and 42% for silver at ball mill grind P 80 = 120\u00b5m (microns). This historical milling operation was challenged by the hard and abrasive nature of the silica breccias, resulting in elevated-maintenance and operating costs in primary, secondary, and tertiary crushing circuits.\n\" Today's results confirm that conventional oxide milling, and HPGR crush heap-leach or ROM heap-leach, depending on mineralization type, are well suited for processing gold and silver mineralization at Atlanta. Referring to a conceptual Atlanta generalized flowsheet in Figure 1 below, a straightforward process breaks out the host mineralization into their respective silica breccia and volcanic units, running high-grade mineralization through a mill and processing lower grade material via a combination HPGR crush and ROM heap leaching. The adoption of HPGR crushing technology (used at other mines in Nevada and around the world) will eliminate SAG milling of silica breccias and high-grade volcanics that in turn should result in reduced overall operating cost against a conventional SABC (Semi-Autogenous-Ball Mill-Crusher) circuit design. It is anticipated that this process will be more cost-effective than historical methods, resulting in lower process cutoff grades and potential for economic extraction of gold and silver from a larger volume of material.\"\nCollin Kettell, Founder & CEO of Nevada King, stated, \"Positive results from the Phase 1 metallurgical test work released today indicate a clear path forward for processing Atlanta's gold and silver mineralization via a combination of crushed and run-of-mine heap leaching together with conventional milling of high-grade mineralization. In a major departure from historical processing and test-work at Atlanta, the potential for using HPGR crushing, as indicated by Phase 1 enhanced test recoveries, could result in very significant benefits and opportunities for flow sheet development in a future potential mining operation. Test results also indicate significantly higher Au/Ag recoveries in the volcanic section, which is fast becoming a major component of the overall mineralized footprint at Atlanta. Looking forward, ongoing resource modeling and metallurgical studies will focus on optimizing the potential economics of mining and processing scenarios utilizing the alternative process options for which this Phase 1 testing program has indicated positive extraction results.\"\nTest Results Summary:\nAtlanta mineralized resources have been characterized into two major resource categories for gold and silver processing: 1. Silicified breccias (mineralized material in and below the main Atlanta unconformity) and Volcanics (mineralized material above the main Atlanta unconformity).\nA breakout of the materials tested above and below the Atlanta unconformity and the laboratory metallurgy gold extraction test results are summarized in Table 1. A full range of rock types at Atlanta have been tested and test results clearly show the significant metallurgical difference between the silicified breccias and the volcanics. A similar table summarizing silver extractions for Atlanta can be found in Table 2.\nSilicified breccias, below the unconformity, are hard and abrasive rocks and have a high degree of sensitivity to process feed particle size.\nVictory Metals, Inc. (Nevada King Gold Corp.) NI 43-101 Technical Report on the Atlanta Project dated December 22, 2020, reported historic Atlanta mill recoveries, for the years 1979-85 at 81% for Au and 42% for Ag, at operating ball mill grind P80 = 120\u00b5m (microns).\nSilicified breccias are amenable to High Pressure Grinding Roll (HPGR) comminution, where high-grade would report to a mill and lower-grade to heap leaching. The determination between higher-grade and lower-grade material will be dependent upon future economic analysis.\nOf significant note is that as the silica breccia gold grade decreases (<1.7 ppm Au), gold extraction increases at coarser P80 particle size, as shown in Table 1. Thus, reinforcing the benefit of milling higher grade and HPGR crush-heap leaching of the lower grade resources.\nVolcanics, above the unconformity, are relatively insensitive to process feed particle size and can be characterized as equal or similar to central Nevada commercial heap leach operations.\nVolcanics are amenable to conventional milling, conventional crush heap leaching and/or ROM heap leaching.\nGold extraction from fine milling at a 200 mesh grind (P80=75\u00b5m) show a weighted average:\n91.7% extraction in the volcanics\n87.5 % extraction in the low-grade silica breccias\n85.9% extraction in the high-grade silica breccias\nGold extraction from conventional crushing (P80=12.5 mm) show a weighted average:\n87.1% extraction from volcanics\n62.1% extraction from low-grade silica breccias\n37.0% extraction from high grade silica breccias\nGold extraction from HPGR crushed composites show a weighted average:\n81.9% extraction from volcanics (only four of the nine volcanic composites were tested using HPGR as the remaining five composites contained elevated levels fines and are not suitable for HPGR processing)\n71.4% extraction from low-grade silica breccias (<1.7 ppm Au)\n50.4% extraction from high-grade silica breccias\nGold Met Balances\nKCA\nSample\nNo.\nComp ID\nUnconf *1\nAbv/Below\nAtlanta Geology\n37\u00b5m BR\n75\u00b5m BR\n1,700\u00b5m BR\n12.5mm Column\n25.0mm Column\nHPGR Column\nFormation\nSubunit\nAu Ext\n%\nCalc Hd\nAu (ppm)\nAu Ext\n%\nCalc Hd\nAu (ppm)\nAu Ext\n%\nCalc Hd\nAu (ppm)\nAu Et\n%\nCalc Hd\nAu (ppm)\nAu Ext\n%\nCalc Hd\nAu (ppm)\nAu Ext\n%\nCalc Hd\nAu (ppm)\n96607 A\nATV-3\nAbove\nVolInt\nQtz latite porph, Int.\n83.4\n1.820\n86.5\n1.823\n64.6\n1.941\n70.3\n1.874\n75.5\n1.979\n96609 A\nATV-5\nAbove\nTww\nVolc.

Samples were cut under the Company's supervision in its Winnemucca, Nevada, warehouse and all samples were placed in heavy canvas bags. CRF standards and coarse blanks were inserted into the sample stream on a one-in-twenty sample basis, meaning both inserts are included in each 20-sample group. Samples were shipped by a local contractor in large sample shipping crates directly to American Assay Lab in Reno, Nevada, with full custody being maintained at all times. At American Assay Lab, samples were weighted then crushed to 75% passing 2mm and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns in order to produce a 300g pulverized split. Prepared samples are initially run using a four acid + boric acid digestion process and conventional mutli-element ICP-OES analysis. Gold assays are initially run using 30-gram samples by lead fire assay with an OES finish to a 0.003 ppm detection limit, with samples greater than 10 ppm finished gravimetrically. Every sample is also run through a cyanide leach for gold with an ICP-OES finish.

Mr. Herron is not independent for purposes of NI 43-101 as he is Exploration Manager of Nevada King.\nAbout Nevada King Gold Corp.\nNevada King is the third largest mineral claim holder in the State of Nevada, behind Nevada Gold Mines (Barrick/Newmont) and Kinross Gold. Starting in 2016 the Company has staked large project areas hosting significant historical exploration work along the Battle Mountain trend located close to current or former producing gold mines. These project areas were initially targeted based on their potential for hosting multi-million ounce gold deposits and were subsequently staked following a detailed geological evaluation. District-scale projects in Nevada King's portfolio include (1) the 100% owned Atlanta Mine, located 100km southeast of Ely, (2) the Lewis and Horse Mountain-Mill Creek projects, both located between Nevada Gold Mines' large Phoenix and Pipeline mines, and (3) the Iron Point project, located 35km east of Winnemucca, Nevada.\nThe Atlanta Mine is a historical gold-silver producer with a NI 43-101 compliant pit-constrained resource of 460,000 oz Au in the measured and indicated category (11.0M tonnes at 1.3 g/t) plus an inferred resource of 142,000 oz Au (5.3M tonnes at 0.83 g/t).

Despite this progress, a notable homeownership gap and\n\u00a0disproportionate rate of mortgage denials \npersists, suggesting that other barriers not related to income are also impeding Black families' access to homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2022, approximately 38.6% of 138 million U.S. families\n1\n were not homeowners, according to the American Community Survey. Among those, more than 6.3 million families were considered \"income mortgage-ready,\"\n2\n meaning their income would allow for paying a typical mortgage payment in their area without being \ncost burdened\n.\u00a0\n \n 7.8% of Black non-home owning families were income-ready for a mortgage, compared to 12.5% of white families \u2014 a gap of 4.7 percentage points. While significant, the gap shrunk by more than one-third since 2012, when it stood at 7.9 percentage points.\n\n\n\"Despite the significant decline in mortgage affordability in the past two years, millions of families who do not own their home have the means to afford the largest share of a homeowner's cost \u2014 the mortgage,\" said Zillow Senior Economist Orphe Divounguy. \"While some families may choose to rent, many are simply constrained. It's crucial to recognize the existence of additional barriers beyond monthly cost, including access to funds for a down payment and closing costs \u2014 as well as other barriers that significantly contribute to mortgage denials, like insufficient credit scores and lack of access to credit. These barriers especially impact people of color.\"\nStill, among all races, the number of renting families able to afford a mortgage dropped to 6.3 million in 2022 from 12.9 million in 2021, as mortgage rates doubled. While higher mortgage rates and higher prices affected everyone, the median family income of renters rose more for Blacks than for whites since 2012. Regions where Black family incomes rose most generally experienced a greater decline in the racial mortgage readiness gap during the 2012 to 2022 period.\nDetroit\n has the highest share (13.3%) of Black renting families earning enough income to comfortably afford a mortgage, followed by \nMemphis\n (12.8%), \nSt. Louis\n (12.0%), \nHouston\n (11.6%) and \nCleveland\n (11.2%). While home values are relatively lower in those communities and more Black families could afford the typical mortgage payment, access to homeownership remains a challenge.\nRacial disparities in home values, homeownership rates and credit security\nEven though the incomes of Black renting families rose faster during the pandemic, significant disparities persist in \nhomeownership\n rates and home values between Black and white Americans. Nationally, white households owned homes at a much higher rate (73%) than Black households (44%), and the gap exceeded 30 percentage points in more than half of the country's 50 largest metros in 2022.\nCompounding the issue, the typical home owned by a white family is still worth far more than the typical home owned by a Black family. Although there has been incremental\n\u00a0progress\n in narrowing the home value gap, it still exceeds 10 percentage points in 42 of the top 50 metro areas.\nDiscriminatory lending practices and higher denial rates for Black mortgage applicants, compounded by credit history issues, also pose challenges to housing equity. In 2022, Black applicants saw a \n146% higher mortgage loan denial rate compared to white applicants\n, potentially hindering future generational wealth transfer. Credit history is the most common reason cited for these denials.\nInitiatives aimed at things like enhancing access to \ndown payment assistance\n and\n\u00a0\ncredit-building opportunities \nas well as \nimplementing reforms in zoning\n, together with efforts to construct and preserve affordable housing in thriving communities, are vital.\nHousing Inequalities by Race\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTop

(TSXV: NKG) (OTCQX: NKGFF) (\"Nevada King\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce assay results from five reverse circulation (\"RC\") holes located along an updated Section 22-8N(3), initially released February 1, 2023 and updated October 30, 2023, that were recently completed at its Atlanta Gold Mine Project located 264km northeast of Las Vegas, Nevada, in the prolific Battle Mountain Trend.\n\nHighlights:\n\nFigure 1. Location map for holes reported in this news release along drill section22-8N(2) relative to the perimeter of the historical Atlanta Pit and footprint of the Gustavson 2020 NI 43-101 resource. Shallow drillholes on the mine dumps have been removed from the plot for clarity. (CNW Group/Nevada King Gold Corp.) Figure 2. Cross section 22-8N(3) looking north across northerly-trending West Atlanta and West Atlanta #1 Faults, both important basement structures that channeled shallow intrusives and Au/Ag bearing fluids up into the receptive host horizon that developed at the uniformity separating Paleozoic basement dolomite and quartzite from overlying Tertiary-age volcanics. High grade mineralization occurred along the steeply-dipping contact separating the silica breccia and rhyolitic intrusive units. (CNW Group/Nevada King Gold Corp.) Figure 3.

True mineralized thicknesses have yet to be determined for AT23NS-174, AT23NS-174A, and AT23NS-161, whereas true mineralized thickness in AT23NS-162 and 163 are estimated to be 90% to 100% of the reported intercept length. +Denotes angle hole.\n\nTwo of today's holes were angle holes that were sited to follow up on the very high-grade intercept of 6.55 g/t Au and 100.8 g/t Ag over 82.3m , including 26.71 g/t Au over 12.2m encountered in angle hole AT23NS-133F, which represents the third most gold rich intercept so far recorded at Atlanta (released November 14, 2023 ). Today's two follow up holes successfully crossed the same high-grade structure, intercepting 6.9 g/t Au and 93.7 g/t Ag over 68.6m including 19.2 g/t Au over 10.7m in AT23NS-174 and 4.9 g/t Au and 75.0 g/t Ag over 77.7m including 19.35 g/t Au over 3.0m in AT23NS-174A .\n\n\n\n\n\n, including encountered in angle hole AT23NS-133F, which represents the third most gold rich intercept so far recorded at (released ). Today's two follow up holes successfully crossed the same high-grade structure, intercepting including in AT23NS-174 and including in AT23NS-174A Collectively, these three steeply dipping angle holes define a high-angle west-dipping high-grade vein-like structure hosted within the hanging wall of the West Atlanta Fault (Figure 2). High grade (>5 g/t Au) mineralization occurs within a hydrothermal breccia zone 5m to 8m thick that cuts up through a 50m -wide rhyolite to quartz latite composition dike sandwiched between the West Atlanta and West Atlanta #1 Faults. Very high-grade mineralization (>20 g/t Au) is concentrated along the contact between the breccia and intrusive within a boiling zone that coincides with a sharp upward inflection in the contact's dip.\n\n\n\n\n\nto thick that cuts up through a -wide rhyolite to quartz latite composition dike sandwiched between the and #1 Faults. Very high-grade mineralization (>20 g/t Au) is concentrated along the contact between the breccia and intrusive within a boiling zone that coincides with a sharp upward inflection in the contact's dip. There appears to be about 30m of vertical extent to this very high-grade zone that is characterized by a very vuggy, strongly silicified heterolithic breccia infilled by iron oxides, clay, and barite. Lower grade mineralization spreads out laterally from the high-grade feeder zone into adjacent dike and felsic tuff hosts, as indicated by intercepts plotted around this high-grade zone (see Figure 3). We also see the high-grade zone flattening westward in Figure 2 where it was encountered in previously released holes AT23NS-53 (11.12 g/t Au over 12.2m , released February 1, 2023 ) and AT22HG-20 (10.09 g/t Au over 6.1m , released February 1, 2023 ). This high-grade \"tail\" that flattens at depth away from the very high-grade zone is seen in numerous holes throughout the Atlanta deposit and may be the best guide for vectoring into additional concentrations of high-grade mineralization.\n\n\n\n\n\nof vertical extent to this very high-grade zone that is characterized by a very vuggy, strongly silicified heterolithic breccia infilled by iron oxides, clay, and barite.

For the first time, Nevada King now has direct confirmation of a high-angle feeder structure, which in itself strongly supports the Company's new geological model for the mineralization at Atlanta . In terms of size, shape, and depth, the Company will now use this new understanding of high-angle, high-grade feeders to more confidently pursue potential high-grade zones hosted elsewhere throughout the deposit, looking for combinations of high-grade intercepts most likely to vector into discreet areas where close-spaced drilling may encounter and define additional high-grade bodies possessing potential for significantly upgrading these various portions of the resource zone.\n\n\n\n\n\nnow has direct confirmation of a high-angle feeder structure, which in itself strongly supports the Company's new geological model for the mineralization at .

As shown on Figure 3, two other prospective feeder zones are outlined in blue to the southeast and east of AT23NS-174. Angle hole AT23NS-131C (4.91 g/t Au over 39.6m , released January 9, 2024 ) and vertical hole AT22NS-68 (4.03 g/t Au over 29m including 10.03 g/t Au over 3m , released January 6, 2023 ) are considerably higher grade than the surrounding holes, so we now suspect there is another feeder structure in close proximity to these holes. In similar manner, vertical hole AT21-63 (3.95 g/t Au over 41.2m includes 9.23 g/t Au over 9.1m , released January 20, 2022 ) and angle hole AT22NS-61A (2.23 g/t Au over 51.8m includes 5.95 g/t Au over 4.6m near top of intercept, released October 18, 2022 ) also exhibit evidence of proximity to a high-grade feeder along the East Atlanta Fault.\n\n\n\n\n\n, released ) and vertical hole AT22NS-68 (4.03 g/t Au over including 10.03 g/t Au over , released ) are considerably higher grade than the surrounding holes, so we now suspect there is another feeder structure in close proximity to these holes. In similar manner, vertical hole AT21-63 (3.95 g/t Au over includes 9.23 g/t Au over , released ) and angle hole AT22NS-61A (2.23 g/t Au over includes 5.95 g/t Au over near top of intercept, released ) also exhibit evidence of proximity to a high-grade feeder along the East Atlanta Fault. The three vertical holes released today tested and successfully filled in gaps in the current drill pattern along the footwall side of the WAF (Figure 1) and intercepted 1.93 g/t Au over 50.3m , 3.44 g/t Au over 36.6m , and 1.25 g/t Au over 27.4.\n\nCal Herron, Exploration Manager of Nevada King, stated, \"We chose to further pursue the high-grade intercept in AT23NS-133F largely because we could fan-drill the probable strike line with a series of shallow, steep angle holes from a single drill platform. So far, we've proven that the high-grade mineralization can be tracked along strike, which will enable a resource modeler to tie the high-grade intercepts together into a cohesive body. Just as important, we also now see what a high-grade feeder zone at Atlanta looks like and how it relates geologically to the surrounding rocks and structures. The whole point of drill-defining these high-grade structures is to further up-grade the resource, both in scale and confidence. The AT23NS-133F high-grade zone may be too narrow to appreciably upgrade the surrounding area, unless additional definition drilling can connect the higher grade mineralization (>5 g/t Au) eastward to the West Atlanta Fault, as seen in Figure 3 above. However, the larger areas northwest and southwest of the pit along lines 22-3N through 22-7N and 22-14N through 22-18N host considerably more potential for increasing overall grade. In both areas there is good evidence for multiple feeder zones, such as hole AT23WS-44 (11.64 g/t Au over 108.2m including 37.16 g/t Au over 29m). Going forward, Nevada King is now re-evaluating its drill intercepts within both areas and choosing discreet targets to selectively test.\"\n\nHole No. From (m)  Interval (m) Au (g/t) Ag (g/t) Notes AT23NS-133F+ 117.4 199.7 82.3 6.55 100.8\n\nincludes 184.5 196.6 12.2 26.71 89.3\n\nAT23NS-133G+ 97.6 126.5 29.0 1.46 23.9\n\nAT22NS-53 157.0 224.1 67.1 2.88 52.0\n\nIncludes 205.8 218.0 12.2 11.12 122.1\n\nAT22NS-54 170.7 216.5 45.7 4.21 79.6\n\nIncludes 173.8 199.7 25.9 5.40 113.8\n\nAT22NS-61A+ 6.1 57.9 51.8 2.23 59.0 Bottomed in mineralization Includes 22.9 27.4 4.6 5.95 20.1\n\nAT22NS-68 134.1 163.1 29.0 4.03 21.2\n\nIncludes 157.0 160.1 3.0 10.03 18.5\n\nAT21-63 7.6 48.8 41.2 3.94 27.3\n\nincludes 38.1 47.3 9.1 9.23 24.3 Bottomed in mineralization AT23NS-131C+ 132.6 172.3 39.6 4.91 41.4\n\nincludes 157.0 160.1 3.0 10.03 18.5\n\nAT22HG-20 207.3 240.9 33.5 3.43 125.7\n\nIncludes 233.2 239.3 6.1 10.09 284\n\nAT23HG-31 176.8 294.2 74.7 0.73 22.7\n\nAT22NS-51 89.9 109.8 19.8 2.92 61.5\n\nIncludes 93.0 102.1 9.1 4.85 96\n\nAT23NS-70 80.8 108.2 27.4 4.96 49.3\n\nAT22NS-71 36.6 88.4 51.8 2.95 79.5\n\nincludes 54.9 68.6 13.7 5.90 164\n\n\n\nTable 2.

CRF standards, blanks, and duplicates are inserted into the sample stream on-site on a one-in-twenty sample basis, meaning all three inserts are included in each 20-sample group. Samples are shipped by a local contractor in large sample shipping crates directly to American Assay Lab in Reno, Nevada, with full custody being maintained at all times. At American Assay Lab, samples were weighted then crushed to 75% passing 2mm and pulverized to 85% passing 75 microns in order to produce a 300g pulverized split. Prepared samples are initially run using a four acid + boric acid digestion process and conventional mutli-element ICP-OES analysis. Gold assays are initially run using 30-gram samples by lead fire assay with an OES finish to a 0.003 ppm detection limit, with samples greater than 10 ppm finished gravimetrically. Every sample is also run through a cyanide leach for gold with an ICP-OES finish. The QA/QC procedure involves regular submission of Certified Analytical Standards and property-specific duplicates.\n\nQualified Person\n\nThe scientific and technical information in this news release has been reviewed and approved by Calvin R. Herron, P.Geo., who is a Qualified Person as defined by National Instrument 43-101 (\"NI 43-101\").\n\n Nevada King Gold Corp.\n\nNevada King is the third largest mineral claim holder in the State of Nevada, behind Nevada Gold Mines (Barrick/Newmont) and Kinross Gold. Starting in 2016 the Company has staked large project areas hosting significant historical exploration work along the Battle Mountain trend located close to current or former producing gold mines. These project areas were initially targeted based on their potential for hosting multi-million-ounce gold deposits and were subsequently staked following a detailed geological evaluation. District-scale projects in Nevada King's portfolio include (1) the 100% owned Atlanta Mine, located 100km southeast of Ely, (2) the Lewis and Horse Mountain-Mill Creek projects, both located between Nevada Gold Mines' large Phoenix and Pipeline mines, and (3) the Iron Point project, located 35km east of Winnemucca, Nevada.\n\nThe Atlanta Mine is a historical gold-silver producer with a NI 43-101 compliant pit-constrained resource of 460,000 oz Au in the measured and indicated category (11.0M tonnes at 1.3 g/t) plus an inferred resource of 142,000 oz Au (5.3M tonnes at 0.83 g/t).

As far as our over-all business performance, 2023 marked the second year of Ryerson's longest and most significant investment cycle in more than a generation. We are taking big steps to create our next-generation operating model and the industry's best customer experience. Over the past year, we invested in the modernization, integration and expansion of our network of interconnected intelligent service centers, highlighted by an Enterprise Resource Planning (\"ERP\") conversion across our largest business unit, new and expanding facilities at Centralia, WA, University Park, IL, Las Vegas, NV, and Shelbyville, KY, as well as welcoming four excellent additions to the Family of Companies in BLP Holdings, LLC, Norlen Incorporated, TSA Processing, and Hudson Tool Steel Corporation. We finished the year with approximately two-thirds of our operating cash flow allocated to growth-oriented projects while increasing our dividend over four consecutive quarters and buying back approximately $114 million of Ryerson shares for the full-year.\n\nOver the fourth quarter and the entire year, as we carried out our investments in modernization, integration, and expansion, our business operated against a backdrop of slowing manufacturing activity. You could say the sun wasn't shining on our addressable markets as full-year industry stainless volumes corrected down 14% and nickel traded down by more than 40%, while other industrial metal-consuming verticals to which we have less exposure performed better, such as automotive, aerospace, defense and non-residential construction. Fourth quarter volumes decreased across most of our end-markets due to holiday seasonality and ongoing destocking across non-ferrous product lines. For the full-year 2023, our end-market volumes mainly increased in our commercial ground transportation and oil & gas end-markets, while decreasing across most other industrial and consumer end-markets. Despite moving through a counter-cyclical bottom across the majority of our commercial book of business, we continue to believe that our aforementioned investments in our next-gen operating model will position us to deliver higher thru-the-cycle earnings to our shareholders with less volatility as we inflect to an anticipated industry upturn as well as expected longer-term secular growth drivers in North American manufacturing.\"\n\nFourth Quarter Results\n\nRyerson generated revenue of $1.1 billion in the fourth quarter of 2023, a decrease of 10.8% compared to the third quarter of 2023. Revenue during the period was influenced by seasonally lower volumes and easing average selling prices, which decreased 5.9% to 450,000 tons and 5.2% to $2,472 per ton, respectively, compared to the third quarter of 2023.\n\nGross margin expanded sequentially by 220 basis points to 22.2% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 20.0% in the third quarter. Gross margins reflected LIFO income of $59.3 million, as average inventory costs were impacted by decreases in commodity price for our metals products sales mix. Excluding the impact of LIFO, gross margin contracted 40 basis points to 16.9% in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to 17.3% in the third quarter. The compression in gross margins, excluding LIFO, was primarily driven by a decrease in prices of our aluminum and stainless-steel product mix due to above normal inventories in the channel that put downward pressure on average selling prices.\n\nWarehousing, delivery, selling, general and administrative expenses increased 5.5% to $203.7 million in the fourth quarter, compared to $193.0 million in the third quarter, primarily driven by higher depreciation expense, increased operating expenses from recent acquisitions, as well as reorganization expenses related to our ERP system conversion and start-up costs associated with the University Park, Illinois service center, partially offset by lower personnel-related expenses, lower delivery expenses, and lower fixed and variable operating expenses.\n\nNet income attributable to Ryerson Holding Corporation for the fourth quarter of 2023 was $25.8 million, or $0.74 per diluted share, compared to net income of $35.0 million, or $1.00 per diluted share in the previous quarter. Ryerson generated Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO of $25.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2023, compared to the third quarter Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO of $45.0 million. For the full-year 2023, Ryerson generated $5.1 billion in revenue and earned $145.7 million in net income and $231.1 million in Adjusted EBITDA, excluding LIFO.\n\nLiquidity & Debt Management\n\nRyerson generated $90.1 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter of 2023, supported by net income attributable to Ryerson Holding of $25.8 million and working capital release of $15.1 million. The Company ended the fourth quarter of 2023 with $436.5 million of debt and $382.2 million of net debt, an increase of $69.5 million and $54.4 million, respectively, compared to the fourth quarter of 2022. Ryerson's leverage ratio as of the fourth quarter was 1.7x, which remains within the Company's target leverage range. Ryerson's global liquidity, composed of cash and cash equivalents and availability on its revolving credit facilities, was $656 million as of December 31, 2023.\n\nShareholder Return Activity\n\nDividends. On February 21, 2024, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.1875 per share of common stock, payable on March 21, 2024, to stockholders of record as of March 7, 2024. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Ryerson paid a quarterly dividend in the amount of $0.1850 per share, amounting to a cash return of approximately $6.3 million. For the full-year 2023, Ryerson paid dividends of approximately $0.72 per share, which resulted in a return of $24.8 million to shareholders.\n\nShare Repurchase. Ryerson repurchased 219,614 shares for $6.3 million in the open market during the fourth quarter of 2023. Ryerson made these repurchases in accordance with its share repurchase authorization, which allows the Company to acquire up to an aggregate amount of $100.0 million of the Company's common stock through April of 2025. For the full-year 2023, the Company repurchased 3.3 million shares, resulting in a return of $113.9 million to shareholders.

That is 80% more than in \nJanuary 2020\n, showing how the math has changed for hopeful buyers, who are more often \npartnering with friends and family\n or \n\"house hacking\"\n their way to homeownership.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nContinue Reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZillow logo (PRNewsfoto/Zillow Group)\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, a household earning \n$59,000\n annually could comfortably afford the monthly mortgage on a typical U.S. home, spending no more than 30% of its income with a 10% down payment. That was below the U.S. median income of about \n$66,000\n, meaning more than half of American households had the financial means to afford homeownership.\n \nNow, the roughly \n$106,500\n needed to comfortably afford a typical home is well above what a typical U.S. household earns each year, estimated at about \n$81,000\n.\n1\n\n\n\"Housing costs have soared over the past four years as drastic hikes in home prices, mortgage rates and rent growth far outpaced wage gains,\" said Orphe Divounguy, a senior economist at Zillow. \"Buyers are getting creative to make a purchase pencil out, and \nlong-distance movers\n are targeting less expensive and less competitive metros. Mortgage rates easing down has helped some, but the key to improving affordability long term is to build more homes.\"\nA monthly mortgage payment on a typical U.S. home has nearly doubled since \nJanuary 2020\n, up 96.4% to \n$2,188\n (assuming a 10% down payment). Home values have risen 42.4% in that time, with the typical U.S. home now \nworth about \n$343\n,\n000\n. Mortgage rates ended \nJanuary 2020\n near 3.5%\n, keeping the cost of a home affordable for most households that could manage the down payment. At the time of this analysis, mortgage rates were about 6.6%.\nFor a household making the median income, it would take almost \n8.5 years before they would have enough saved to put 10% down\n on a typical U.S. home, about a year longer than it would have in 2020.\n2\n\u00a0It's no wonder, then, that \nhalf of first-time buyers\n say at least part of their down payment came from a gift or loan from family or friends.\nWith the cost of a mortgage rising, most millennial and Gen Z buyers say \"house hacking\" \u2014 \nthe ability to rent out all or part of a home\n for extra cash \u2014 is very or extremely important. Co-buying with a friend or relative is another way to help with affordability, something \n21% of last year's buyers reported doing\n.\nMetro areas where a buyer could comfortably afford a typical home with the lowest income are \nPittsburgh\n (\n$58,232\n income needed to afford a home), \nMemphis\n \n($69,976)\n, \nCleveland\n \n($70,810)\n, \nNew Orleans\n \n($74,048)\n and \nBirmingham\n \n($74,338)\n. The only major metros where a typical home is affordable to a household making the median income are \nPittsburgh\n, \nSt. Louis\n and \nDetroit\n.\nThere are seven markets among the major metros where a household's income must be \n$200,000\n or more to comfortably afford a typical home. The top four are in \nCalifornia\n: \nSan Jose\n \n($454,296)\n, \nSan Francisco\n \n($339,864)\n, \nLos Angeles\n \n($279,250)\n and \nSan Diego\n \n($273,613)\n. \nSeattle\n \n($213,984)\n, the \nNew York City\n metro area \n($213,615)\n and \nBoston\n \n($205,253)\n complete the list.\nTo help find a home within budget, home shoppers on Zillow can \nfilter search results by monthly cost\n instead of by list price. The tool simplifies the complex calculation of translating a home's list price into the monthly cost, factoring in the latest mortgage rates.\nThose needing a down payment boost may qualify for down payment assistance. Home listings on Zillow include a \ndown payment assistance module\n to help shoppers see what local resources could be available to them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMetropolitan\nArea*\n

The Lynx won 88-73. Sam Wasson / Getty Images\nMoore officially announced her retirement last year, but she last played in 2018. She spent her entire career in Minnesota and is first in franchise history in points per game, total steals and three-pointers made. She won four championships with the Lynx, was named MVP in 2014 and made the WNBA's 2021 list of the top 25 players of all time.\nMoore stepped away from the game to help free Jonathan Irons, a wrongfully convicted Missouri man whom she later married.\nIn December, Moore was announced as a member of the 2024 Women's Basketball Hall of Fame class.\nYears after she left the game, Moore is still inspiring the next generation. She paid Iowa Hawkeyes superstar Caitlin Clark a visit before Clark's record-breaking performance earlier this month. Clark said she was \"fangirling\" over Moore's surprise visit.\nMoore is the fifth Lynx player to have her jersey retired, after Lindsay Whalen (13), Rebekkah Brunson (32), Seimone Augustus (33) and Sylvia Fowles (34).\nNote: The video above originally aired in June 2023.",

This year, the Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas will host a Super Bowl powered entirely by renewable energy \u2014 a first in the history of the event.\n\nThe seemingly desolate area of the Nevada desert is the source of the green energy used to power the game.\n\nA vast solar farm with over 621,000 panels shimmers like a mirage but with the capability to power close to 60,000 residential customers \u2014 or one very big stadium.\n\nThe Las Vegas Raiders, which call Allegiant Stadium home, have entered into a 25-year agreement to buy power from this new solar installation owned by NV Energy.\n\nCEO Doug Cannon said that the solar installation would supply more than 10 megawatts of power for the Super Bowl. This amount of energy is roughly equivalent to the consumption of 46,000 homes.\n\nSustainability was front of mind as the stadium was being constructed, according to Raiders President Sandra Douglass Morgan.\n\nThe stadium's roof is made of a sustainable plastic material that allows in about 10% of daylight but blocks all solar heat, so it takes less energy to cool the building. The grass field is moved outdoors on a rail system to get natural sunlight rather than using energy-intensive growing lights. And everything from grass clippings to food scraps and cigarette butts are composted or converted into other forms of energy.\n\n\"When you come to a game you may be thinking about just focusing on the game but when they hear that and know that we're being conscious of our environmental footprint hopefully that guest will leave and have that same mindset when they go back home,\" said Douglass Morgan.\n\nThe Super Bowl's green energy push was highlighted during a visit from U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer Granholm, who inspected the stadium's main electrical entry room.\n\n\"People sometimes get nervous about renewable power because they're not sure if it's going to be reliable. The fact that renewable power can power a facility like this reliably should speak volumes about what could happen in other communities,\" Granholm said.\n\nThe solar farm not only powers the current needs but also houses massive batteries to store renewable energy, ensuring a five-hour power supply even when the sun isn't shining. This technology is seen as a key component in transitioning the U.S. power grid toward 100% clean electricity by 2035, a goal set by President Biden.\n\nDespite the focus on environmental sustainability, the Super Bowl's entertainment, including a halftime show featuring performer Usher, will not be compromised.\n\n\"We have enough power for Usher and all of his lights and all the fanfare that'll be there,\" said Cannon.\n\nWatch the Super Bowl on your local CBS station, on Nickelodeon and streaming on Paramount+ on Sunday, Feb. 11.",
