Bills 27 24 in the AFC West Divisional game this weekend While fans were n't able to see the Chiefs play at GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium many Chiefs fans still braved cold and snow to cheer on their team alongside Taylor Swift and a shirtless Jason Kelce at Highmark Stadium Last week we asked our readers about their plans to see the AFC West divisional game in Orchard Park NY Here 's what you shared While we did n't hear from any fans traveling from the Midwest to see the Chiefs play we did hear from a few Chiefs fans living in or near New York Andy Cowherd had plans to travel from his home in New Jersey to attend the Wild Card game in Kansas City but his plans changed when he saw the weather forecast Called my sister a season ticket holder and told her I was canceling my flight home and staying in New Jersey Cowherd wrote to The Star Watched on Peacock which I already had Cocktail fireplace family Chiefs win Nice evening Thanks to their match up against the Bills Cowherd was able to see the Chiefs play without having to travel too far I regularly attend Chiefs playoff games in KC Seeing one in Buffalo with Josh Allen vs. Patrick will be a treat Cowherd wrote The Star prior to the game My daughter an NJ born Chiefs fan and I will travel from Morristown NJ Will rendezvous with a former work colleague from NYC who is a die hard Bills fan Pre gaming with him and his family at Danny 's South near the stadium He added Looking forward to a Chiefs win 23 20 With the Chiefs winning by three points 27 24 Cowherd was n't far off Between the cost of flights hotels and game tickets Kansas Citians would have had to pay a pretty penny to make it to Buffalo to see the Chiefs victory over the Bills Nicki Miller attended the Wild Card game in Kansas City last weekend Of this weekend 's game in New York Miller said I would go if I could afford it For Chiefs fans living in the Northeast however the road game gave many fans the opportunity to see their team play closer to home The Northeastern Chiefs fans we heard from all had personal connections to the home of the Chiefs Dakota Reed said I live in NY Dad 's from Kansas so we could n't miss a chance to see the Chiefs here in NY I 'll be going with my parents and decked out in full Chiefs gear Kathie Smith attended the game with her husband Gary The couple now lives in New York but was married in Prairie Village in 1971 We are avid Chiefs fans as we originally are from Kansas City Kathie said We now live in Lake Placid New York so KIND OF used to cold weather We are surrounded by Bills fans and do like the Bills as well just not like THE CHIEFS We are driving 6 hours to hopefully be able to sit on the snow covered seats to watch hopefully and amazing game GO CHIEFS After the game Smith said karma caught up to the Bills for the way their fans acted at the game The fans were so obnoxious and hateful Not to the Chiefs fans necessarily not scary but awful The Bills deserved to lose with the behavior Throwing ice snow language Smith said Despite the Bills fans behavior Smith said she loved being sooo close to OUR BOYS Jerry Mitchell is from Dalton New York an hour outside Buffalo and is a life long Bills fan The Chiefs Bills match up is giving him the chance to enjoy the game with the Chiefs fan in his life My wife is a big Chiefs fan especially when they play the Bills Mitchell wrote to The Star I am going to take her to a couple of my favorite Buffalo restaurants My wife is coming to root for the Chiefs and to taunt me It 's safe to say Mitchell 's wife had plenty to taunt him

lifetime ban from the pharmaceutical industry Tuesday the New York attorney general 's office said the case proved another prominent individual should be banned from their business former President Trump New York Attorney General Letitia James 's D office wrote in a letter to the judge overseeing Trump 's civil fraud trial Tuesday that the affirmation of Shkreli 's lifetime ban should embolden the judge to seek the same penalty for the former president A former drug company CEO Shkreli was sued by James and the Federal Trade Commission in 2020 after hiking the price of life saving medication while simultaneously taking action to prevent competitive medicines from being approved for sale in the United States The attorney general 's office noted that in its closing arguments of Trump 's fraud trial the state cited a different judge 's decision to bar Shkreli from participating in the pharmaceutical industry for life and to order him to pay $ 64.6 million Trump 's legal team forcefully pushed back against the characterization reiterating arguments made at trial that there are no victims of the fraud alleged by the attorney general Trump lawyer Chris Kise said in a statement that in stark contrast Shkreli 's case involved several witnesses complaints and victims The monetary award in that case compensated actual victims and the lifetime ban blocked Shkreli from menacing a fragile populace again he said Comparing this case to that of Martin Shkreli demonstrates the Attorney General 's willingness to wield the power of her office recklessly and her desperation and obvious frustration with President Trump 's front running ascent towards the White House Kise said Judge Arthur Engoron found Trump the Trump Organization and several top executives liable for fraud last year and a trial to determine other claims and any penalties concluded earlier this month James has asked the judge to force Trump to pay nearly $ 370 million as a penalty and to issue a lifetime ban on the former president and two top executives from doing real estate business in New York Her office also asked for a five year ban on Trump 's adult sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump Engoron said he hopes to issue a decision in the case by Jan. 31 though it could come at any time\", 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/ny-ag-cites-martin-shkreli-214829775.html', 'author': 'Ella Lee',

emerging between Nassau County officials and Hofstra University The private college in Hempstead has come out firmly against a plan backed by Las Vegas Sands to build a casino at the site of the nearby Nassau Coliseum A lawsuit by Hofstra stopped a lease transfer that left the bid in limbo But the dispute took a dramatic and unexpected turn this week when Nassau County accused Hofstra of colluding with a rival bid for a casino in Queens backed by New York Mets owner Steve Cohen and Hard Rock Officials subpoenaed university president Susan Poser to testify in front of the Nassau legislature and turn over all communications between people associated with Hofstra and Cohen Hard Rock and several other corporations The impropriety of the subpoenas is egregious Hofstra said in court documents looking to throw out the subpoenas The subpoenas constitute a blatant effort to harass with no basis in law In court filings Hofstra accused local lawmakers of stepping beyond their authority and trying to circumvent the judicial process They slammed the move as a transparent attempt by local lawmakers to retaliate against the university in the ongoing casino dispute The legal skirmish revolves around an agreement bidders for one of New York 's casino licenses must sign that says No attempt has been made or will be made by the applicant to induce any other person or entity to submit or not to submit an application or supplement to an application for the purpose of restricting competition Hofstra is not an applicant for a license But the college has been sharply at odds with the county over the high stakes Sands casino bid Last spring Hofstra filed a lawsuit seeking to block it saying the county had denied them sufficient opportunity to provide feedback on a lease transfer for the site A lower court state judge sided with Hofstra in the fall and annulled the 99 year lease agreement leading Nassau to appeal In the latest escalation county officials charged Wednesday that Hofstra had coordinated with Cohen 's office and Hard Rock to block the rival bid from Las Vegas Sands on Long Island Hard Rock has rejected the claim It is ironic and disingenuous that Hofstra has been calling for transparency and is now trying to duck out of a hearing to explain their relationship with Hard Rock its affiliates subsidiaries and related groups Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman said Thursday in a statement What does a Hofstra have to hide The state is expected to award three downstate licenses but competition is fierce as two of the downstate licenses are expected to go to existing racinos in Yonkers and South Ozone Queens In New York City there are five contenders in Midtown Manhattan one in the Bronx at Ferry Point the Queens proposal by Cohen and one in Brooklyn by Coney Island Hofstra managed to delay the county 's subpoena until next month but a judge ruled late Friday the university has to provide the answers county officials are looking for Blakeman cited a recent day column that described a lobbyist in an email exchange with Cohen 's asset management firm and Hard Rock planning to check with Hofstra if it will oppose a recent development The university president denied contact with casino bidders outside of Nassau according to the column No evidence was offered at the press conference of such communication or of any improper conduct by Hofstra University a lawyer for Hofstra said in court documents yet great effort was taken to malign Hofstra University and announce the issuance of subpoenas to it With Tim Balk and Téa Kvetenadze\", 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/ny-casino-license-wars-spark-161700492.html', 'author': 'Cayla Bamberger', 'published_date': '2024-01-20', 'image_link':

potential in the shop and location deciding to take the plunge He opened on Jan. 12 I opened up with zero clientele because you know my shop is in New York City So I just you know shot for the stars he said Surprisingly enough it was great The second week was busier than the first and it 's only going to go up from there he adds With six chairs Stepping Razor offers a range of services from

that walking into a barber shop can be intimidating for some I know that people especially women and younger customers can feel intimidated or unsure when walking into a barber shop he said But that 's not the case at Stepping Razor I make sure to create a welcoming and respectful atmosphere for everyone who walks through the door I want people to feel comfortable and at ease and not judged

Kathy Hochul has proposed to seek construction of up to 15000 homes on unused state properties but has revealed only a few of its target sites', 'summary': \"A former prison in Dutchess County A psychiatric center in Queens A pair of SUNY campuses on Long Island Thwarted by state lawmakers last year in her quest to speed housing growth with local mandates Gov. Kathy Hochul has cast about for state owned properties where homes could be built as a new tactic to boost the supply and combat New York 's chief affordability problem In speeches this month Hochul said her administration had identified spots that could yield as many as 15000 housing units a small share of what she said the state needs over the next decade to meet demand and tame soaring rents and house prices She 's backing it with state funds In her budget last week she proposed spending up to $ 250 million each of the next two years for the redevelopment of underutilized sites Those funds would be issued as grants and loans to buy the properties and for all aspects of the planning and construction But details about where those 15000 homes would be built are scarce Hochul mentioned in general terms former prisons and transit adjacent sites as possibilities in her budget But when asked by the USA Today Network for a list of targeted properties and its housing goals for each site her office declined Still a smattering of locations her administration is considering have trickled out in several ways Hochul announced two initial target sites for housing last year She mentioned another in her budget presentation this month And buried in one of her budget bills were three other spots she wants hawk to developers A spokesman for the governor said she 'll gradually reveal which properties are being considered for housing as the state solicits bids for them from developers over the coming months Here 's what we know about locations targeted for new housing in New York One of the first housing prospects announced by Hochul last July was a triangle of land next to Interstate 84 in the Dutchess County town of Fishkill Stretched across its 80 acres are 34 empty buildings that used to form a maximum security prison Downstate Correctional Facility closed since March 2022 The state solicited bids for the shuttered prison from developers and led a delegation of prospective buyers on a site tour two weeks later Hochul 's office told the USA Today Network that it closed the bidding on Sept. 27 but refused to say how many offers were made or how much housing the bidders proposed The property is zoned for single family homes on one acre lots limiting development to no more than 80 houses under those zoning rules Fishkill Supervisor Ozzy Albra said He said he was told two or three bids had been made but had heard nothing about the proposals In theory a zoning change or variance could enable many more homes to be built there But Albra ticked off his concerns about allowing a large housing project including limited water and sewer service and the potential need to build more schools Plus there is currently no firefighting service for that area he noted Downstate Correctional Facility was one of a dozen closed prisons across New York that a state commission studied for redevelopment prospects in a 2022 report They are among 20 the state has closed as the inmate population has plunged in the last two decades One of Hochul 's budget bills revealed three prospective housing sites on Long Island Two are at state colleges Hochul wants to allow SUNY trustees to lease for development 8.7 acres of unused land on the Farmingdale campus and 10 acres at the Stony Brook campus The third Long Island site is state owned land next to a Long Island Rail Road station in the town of Babylon The location beside the Pinelawn station is ideal for the sort of commuter enclave Hochul started promoting with her initial housing push last year The Hochul administration revealed plans last month to welcome more than 2800 homes to a 58 acre section of the Creedmoor Psychiatric Center campus in Queens much to the chagrin of its neighbors as the The City news site reported That project alone makes up nearly one fifth of the 15000 homes being sought on state properties In addition the city solicited bids last year from developers for at least three prospective housing sites in Manhattan a vacant state owned parcel next to the Javits Convention Center and two former prisons Bayview Correctional Facility and Lincoln Correctional Facility Plans for Lincoln are likely on hold because it 's currently being used to house asylum seekers Last year Hochul laid out bold plans to spur construction of 800000 homes over 10 years twice the pace of the previous decade They included mandating housing growth rates for every municipality in New York and requiring zoning for dense housing near commuter train stations outside New York City Those plans fizzled after suburbs rebelled against the mandates and state lawmakers tried to replace them with grant incentives for municipalities This year Hochul outlined a revised vision that included the use of state properties and a requirement that municipalities meet growth targets to qualify for certain state grants She also revived elements of last year 's plan pertaining strictly to New York City such as the replacement of an expired tax program meant to foster new affordable housing Chris McKenna covers government and politics for The Journal and USA Today Network Reach him at

Peaks', 'summary': \"The Mohawk Valley lies in the path of totality for the Great American Eclipse on April 8 Local municipalities will experience 99 visibility of the celestial event New Yorkers will have to wait another two decades to view the next total eclipse in 2044 Whether you take a trip up north or stay put the sky will completely darken said Associate Professor of Physics at Hamilton College Adam Lark The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation DEC advertised the Adirondack Park and the Finger Lakes region as optimal sites for viewing the eclipse According to DEC officials their primary concerns for the event are public safety and the protection of natural resources DEC Commissioner Basil Seggos noted the rarity of the eclipse This unique event will provide New Yorkers a front row seat to one of the most captivating natural wonders on our planet she said in a statement The DEC encourages those viewing the eclipse to do so safely and to be respectful of others and our shared environment at all times Regional conservation groups such as the Adirondack Mountain Club Adirondack Council and the Finger Lakes Trail Conference FLTC fear the environmental impact to occur if hikers are n't advised what trails to take Each organization has offered tips on how to best enjoy the eclipse while treading lightly Locals gathered on Oct. 14 at Hamilton College 's Peters Observatory to observe the last annual solar eclipse known as the ring of fire The name comes from the phenomenon at play where the moon partially blocks the sun and emits a circular glow Adam Lark Director of the Observatory recalled visitors eager to catch a glimpse of the halo effect yet not quite lucky enough There was only a 20 chance of viewing the last eclipse said Lark This one will offer full visibility The total solar eclipse on April 8 will be very clear as the path of totality runs through Upstate New York A total solar eclipse happens when the moon passes between the sun and Earth completely blocking the face of the sun according to NASA officials The sky will darken as if it were dawn or dusk In Utica the eclipse will start at 2:10 p.m. move into a peak coverage of 99.4 at 3:24 p.m. then the region will observe darkness until 4:35 p.m. Lark said The state has prompted New Yorkers to flock north and observe the eclipse from the Adirondack Park or the Finger Lakes region Adirondack Mountain Club Director of Communications Benjamin Brosseau fears that without proper education large hiking groups in April could yield ecological repercussions The Adirondack Mountain Club has a team of summit stewards that research the park 's alpine zone the region between the tree line and the snowline Two years ago they conducted a study looking at the effects of climate change on high altitude vegetation The alpine zone depends on winter weather said Brousseau The vegetation includes tundra plants remnants from the Ice Age that rely on snow packs As we experience warmer winters with less snow our stewards fear what may happen to the alpine ecosystem As a result of thinning snow packs New York 's alpine zone has become increasingly susceptible to damage caused by winter hikers said Brosseau Without the cushion of snow he warned that microspikes on the bottom of snowshoes could agitate the vegetation We typically see a lot of trail side erosion during the spring when people veer off the paths to avoid the ice he explained Conditions this April will likely resemble a combination of mud and ice as opposed to snow 2024 's biggest astronomical events Every eclipse meteor shower and full moon all year DEC Assistant Public Information Officer Todd J. Pignataro also noted the anticipated trail conditions for the eclipse April marks the end of winter and the beginning of mud season making backcountry conditions extremely variable he said Trails will likely be slick which poses a risk to the surrounding environment one which is already prone to degradation Adirondack Council Communications Associate Justin Levine noted there are plenty of alternative trails to experience Any loss of soil at this point during this season would present as catastrophic to the rare plants that call the alpine zone their home he said For this reason hikers should avoid all hikes above 2500 feet in elevation With alpine trails out of the question Brosseau suggested scenic overlooks instead The roads that run through the Adirondacks were designed with public viewsheds in mind he said If you drive to Indian Lake or Lake Abanakee you 'll find plenty of south facing overlooks with great views of the eclipse Brosseau encouraged hikers to trek front country trails like the Adirondack Rail Trail Adirondack Rail Trail Association ARTA Treasurer Lee Keet assured paths would be open for the eclipse We can accommodate hundreds if not thousands of visitors Keet said The Rail Trail can be accessed from dozens of points between Lake Placid and Tupper Lake all of which will feature great views of the eclipse While the Finger Lakes Trail Conference FLTC has trails within the path of totality they are n't promoting an on trail experience for the eclipse The tree canopy overhead would block the view explained FLTC Associate of Communications Tim Holohan FLTC Office Manager Willa Powel confirmed their service center in Mount Morris will still be open to accommodate eclipse goers As will be the Mount Morris Dam Recreation Center and Letchworth State Park she said Since the Mohawk Valley is promised 99 visibility Professor Lark encouraged locals to stay put and enjoy the eclipse from their own backyard He 's teamed up with local libraries to ensure they 'll have eclipse glasses and demos set up for the big day The DEC encourages all outdoor enthusiasts to follow the Hiker Responsibility Code practice Leave No Trace principles and avoid high elevation trails said officer Pignataro Those headed to State Forests or Forest Preserve lands for the eclipse must observe the following rules Groups of more than 20 people and those that wish to use state land for weddings filmmaking research etc must get a Temporary Revocable Permit TRP from a NYSDEC land manager In the High Peaks Wilderness area of the Adirondacks maximum group sizes are 15 people for day trips and eight people for overnight stays Permits to exceed these limits are not available Camping is prohibited within 150 feet of any road trail or body of water except at camping areas designated by NYSDEC The DEC is studying the after effects of the August 2017 eclipse to create a multi agency task force with government partners to address anticipated issues Pignataro explained On April 8 state employees will be stationed at popular trailheads to provide people with up to date trail information and help direct people toward activities that leave a light environmental impact ADK Council member Levine also urged guests to obey the proper hiking etiquette If there is little to no snow coverage hikers are advised to stay off any dirt or plants and trek only on bare rock If muddy spots are encountered the standard practice is to walk straight through to avoid widening the trail and damaging the surrounding area This article originally appeared on

Barrymore Show invited StudioSTL host Chelsea Haynes on to show them the best St. Louis has to offer during their Wish You Were Here segment They are spotlighting amazing cities across the United States Chelsea started by telling Drew Mathews about the Gateway Arch At 630 feet tall it is the tallest monument in the US and the tallest arch in the world It is so cool it 's actually beautiful Fun fact the arch 's two legs are actually built separately By the time they completed the arch if they were off by just one 64th of an inch the two legs would not have been able to join together at the top stated Haynes The coolest thing about the Arch is that no one died during the construction It is truly a work of art Next Haynes introduced the celebrity hosts to Forest Park It is bigger than Central Park in New York City and attracts 13 million visitors annually It is the home of the St. Louis Art Museum the Missouri History Museum the boathouse and the Muni which is America 's largest and oldest outdoor theater And guess what All of these things are absolutely free said Haynes The Zoo is our jewel inside Forest Park and it is also home to the giant world flight cage It 's a remnant of the 1904 World 's Fair and it is filled with birds This is the moment during the interview where paper birds were displayed Chelsea did you plan this or were you just winging it joked Mathews Maybe I had to take flight to get here right quipped Haynes Then Haynes told the audience about a classic St. Louis dessert gooey butter cake Drew said that this treat is among her favorites Legend has it that a German baker back in the 1930s flip flopped the proportions of flour and butter in a gooey butter cake It came out a little too soft but it 's an absolute magical accident and now it is a St. Louis tradition You can get it literally anywhere in St. Louis but one of my personal favorites is from a local entrepreneur named Erica Miller She 's from the Chocolate Rooster said Haynes Miller was sitting in the audience Drew Barrymore asked her why it is so good Well gooey butter cake We 're basically born with it in our mouths in St. Louis it 's everywhere you are But thirteen years ago somebody asked me to make it in cupcake form which was not heard of It took about 10 years and I 've stuck with it since forming cupcake like bites said Miller It 's gooey and delicious and soft but it also has a really nice sort of texture that balances the gooeyness said Barrymore Oh my God Buckle up butter cake I want some said Mathews Erica brought some butter cake cupcakes for everyone to share The hosts raved about the taste of the desserts The cakes are available across the US from the Chocolate Rooster Barrymore said that she is going to be ordering a ton of them and then handed them out to audience members The former 19th century train station has been renovated into a hub of activity Destinations there now include the St. Louis Wheel the St. Louis Aquarium plus ropes courses mirror mazes and so much more Then Haynes gave the audience a taste of the Grand Hall lights show It was met with oohs and ahs Everyone in the audience got mini butter cakes Drew invited

municipality receives sales tax revenues from the club which is in Mount Vernon', 'summary': \"When the exclusive Bronxville Field Club sought a new director of membership experience in 2023 it turned to a well connected recruitment firm to find the right candidate The firm 's ad purported that the club was located in prestigious Bronxville NY the fabled suburb known for its mansions on the twisting village streets top notch public schools and an easy commute by train to Manhattan After all the club 's mailing address is 40 Locust Lane Bronxville NY 10708 That address however which has been used for state and federal tax documents as well as on its website is not the club 's location The club is located neither in the 10708 zip code nor in prestigious Bronxville The club was established across the municipal boundary on eight acres in the city of Mount Vernon 99 years ago where it has become the focus of a growing municipal battle over taxation and environmental justice As Mount Vernon public works officials assess the club 's unpermitted connection to the city 's stormwater system Mount Vernon Comptroller Darren Morton said he filed a complaint this month with the state Department of Taxation and seeking an official inquiry into the allocation of sales tax revenues from the club My concern is that there seems to be two different addresses and I want to see the address on their certificate of authority and their quarterly forms Morton said That would dictate where the sales tax is being issued Bronxville Field Club legal counsel Kathy Zalantis insists that the local share of the club 's sales tax revenues have always ended up in Mount Vernon As you are aware a mailing address does not determine where an entity pays sales tax Zalantis said The Club has always paid sales taxes to the city of Mount Vernon and will continue to do so The club looks forward to assisting the city of Mount Vernon mayor and City Council with whatever they need Sales tax revenues are remitted by merchants to the state Department of Taxation and which then allocates the local share of the levy based on where the service was provided or the goods were sold For online purchases the tax is paid based on where the item is delivered At a Jan. 11 meeting of the Mount Vernon Industrial Development Agency Mayor Shawn Patterson Howard said the city was intent on determining whether the city has received all sales tax revenues due from the club There 's been so much said about the Bronxville Field Club and whether their taxes and revenues come into Mount Vernon she said If you are duly located in Mount Vernon and doing business in Mount Vernon then you should be paying taxes to the city That 's something we are leaning into and addressing Mount Vernon activist Gabriel Thompson who has encouraged the city to crack down on the club 's unpermitted connection to the city 's stormwater system has also pushed the city to investigate the sales tax issue He lauded Morton for taking action I 'm glad the city is holding the club to account he said They have essentially redlined eight acres of Mount Vernon for their little tennis club that serves the pleasures of the elite And they have the gall to spit in the face of our city by denying our very existence It makes me sick to be honest It 's one more artifact of a history of exclusionary practices by Bronxville and its ilk The sales tax take from the club at 8.38 could be substantial with a good chunk of its $ 10 million in annual revenues subject to the levy State law requires members of athletic clubs be taxed on annual dues and membership fees At the Bronxville Field Club there 's an initiation fee of $ 37000 for new members and annual dues of $ 9040 according to the recruitment ad which noted there are 630 club members Bronxville resident Patrick McEnroe part of US tennis leadership belongs to the field club McEnroe who serves as president of the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport Rhode Island is covering the Australian Open in Melbourne for ESPN Food and drink are taxed at the club 's restaurant and function hall So is the work of local craftsmen who repair and maintain the club 's world class facility with 14 tennis courts four squash courts three paddle tennis courts and a swimming pool Members are assessed an additional $ 1200 a year for the club 's capital fund In 2021 revenues for capital fund and initiation fees totaled $ 1.5 million according to its federal IRS 990 report Where the services are provided means a lot to Bronxville or Mount Vernon The sales tax in both communities is 8.38 with 4 levied by the state of New York and 0.38 going to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in both communities It 's how the remaining 4 local share gets allocated that matters In Mount Vernon it all gets sent from the state to the city with $ 28 million projected in 2024 funding 19 of the city budget The sales tax of 8.38 applies to sales

Tony Soprano So Obsessed With It', 'excerpt': \"Everything you need to know about Tony Soprano 's favorite snack\", 'summary': \"James Gandolfini and cured meats 2024 is the 25th anniversary of The Sopranos and also the year of the mob wife aesthetic Coincidence We think not And if you 're making your way through the series for the first or hundredth time you might notice that a certain word comes up an awful lot gabagool Tony Soprano utters the word many many times as do his Italian American co stars All this chatter got us curious so we dug in to find out exactly what gabagool is and what you need to know about it iStock According to Joe Stracci part time salami slinger at Marbled Meat Shop in Cold Spring gabagool is another name for capicola an Italian cured meat that combines the Italian words for head capo and neck collo Capicola is made using a prime cut of pork from the neck and shoulder The recipes for gabagool aka capicola vary but the general process involves seasoning the meat and then curing for up to six months Most of the time gabagool is n't spicy though that depends on the seasoning ingredients that are used Because it is n't aged for a long time it has a tender texture Some people compare gabagool to prosciutto but prosciutto is made from pork leg and is aged for longer giving it a different flavor and texture According a brilliant story in Atlas Obscura it 's all about linguistics The author notes that about 80 of Italian Americans descended from Southern Italy where there are a number of different dialectics As time and generations went on and people tried to understand each other there is a mangling of the language in an instantly identifiable way Final syllables are deleted certain consonants are swapped with others certain vowels are mutated in certain places This is how mozzarella becomes something like mutzadell ricotta becomes ree goat and prosciutto becomes pruh zhoot Stracci explains it like this I do know that the history of Italian words having the ending vowel sounds chopped off in the pronunciation is a mixture of two things First regional Italian dialects I was told as a kid that a Sicilian could hardly understand a Neapolitan because their dialects were so different The second aspect was when Italians immigrated to the US usually in New York to make their foreign words easier to understand and say they shortened them out of convenience so others would be more open to accepting them pronouncing them and the practice stuck Madonn Stracci says he grew up calling capicola gabagool but the gah sound at the beginning was not as prevalent in his neighborhood There was more of a hint of a cah sound The buhgool was there though he says To see and hear the pronunciation by Staten Island residents check out this video Stracci who grew up snacking on capicola from cold antipast platters See Chop off the final vowel sound yet again found at celebrations like birthday parties or Christmas Eve or a graduation says a slice of capicola pairs well with a chunk of sharp provolone a piece of roasted red pepper and a hunk of fresh seeded Italian bread And adds that you should be standing when you eat it Jeff Silverstein co owner Kitchen Sink Supper Club Meyers Olde Dutch in Beacon NY and who is a big fan of capicola says his favorite way to pair it is with some aged parm fresh baked foccacia roasted red peppers and olive oil Silverstein enjoys a capicola gabagool seasoned with coriander and fennel and black pepper though he notes that recipes can vary Whether you call it capicola or gabagool you should definitely add this tasty cured meat to your next charcuterie board or layer it on a sandwich while definitely channeling your favorite Soprano 's character and saying Gahbahhool Over here If you 're outside of the New York metro area keep in mind that you might need to say capicola when you 're shopping Gabagool or capicola is most readily available at Italian markets but you can also find it online and at some supermarkets\", 'link': 'https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/gabagool-why-tony-soprano-obsessed-000000592.html', 'author': 'Robyn Moreno', 'published_date':

per jar\", 'summary': \"Supermarket tomato sauce has come a long way I grew up in a proudly Southern Italian Sicilian pocket of New York where seemingly everybody 's family had their own passed down recipe for tomato sauce Contrary to what the domestic icon Ina Garten says store bought was not fine Today ready to heat sauces particularly by restaurants are all the rage thanks in part to spots like Rao 's and Carbone 's in New York But decades before the nation went wild over these internet famous critically acclaimed sauces my native suburb was quietly buying up glass jars by another NYC original I 'm talking about Vincent 's Clam Bar first of Little Italy and now best known as a local gem in nearby Long Island Its greatness begins with a colorful back story According to co owner of the now classic Long Island restaurant Anthony Marisi the original Vincent 's Clam Bar established in 1904 was a street cart selling clams scungilli mussels and calamari with mild medium and hot tomato sauce That 's all they did he says And boy did they do it exceptionally well This simple menu was enough to convert the cart into a little corner space on Mott and Hester Streets 10 locations followed including a small one in Carle Place NY Decades later Marisi a server at the time his brother and a few fellow servers begged borrowed and stole to buy the restaurant from the interesting characters who owned it That scrappy wiseguy turned gentleman braggadocio they did n't have managers and continued to wait tables is still the core of the business today It 's widely considered one of the most lauded and beloved Italian restaurants on the island synonymous with celebration and huge family style portions enormous desserts and LI accents heavier than a loaded lasagna Available for sale since the late 1970s Vincent 's Clam Bar was one of the earliest restaurants to offer customers a jarred taste of its restaurant and as Marisi puts it way ahead of its time The mild medium and hot tomato sauces are different from its or any other brand 's classic marinara and its own chunky and even more outstanding tomato basil sauce Vincent 's Clam Bar 's signature sauces are more reddish orange than crimson and because they 're tomato paste based have a smokier sun dried tomato sweetness to them They 're smooth silky and concentrated more like a taste bud coating satiny tomato gravy Marisi confirms the better to cover and cling to seafood as they were intended to You wo n't find chunks of tomatoes or visible herbs in the original trio as you will in Vincent 's other more traditional plum tomato based sauces What you will find is a smooth subtle heat that discreetly comes in at the back of the bite thanks to a process where red pepper flakes are sauteed in oil and gradually layered in increments Because of this it has its own specific flavor profile and texture that 's gained a loyal following for those in the know The most obvious way is to drench mussels scungilli clams and calamari in it whether individually or all together as a frutti di mare how Vincent 's originally intended This can be with or without pasta which is the second most obvious way to use this sauce I suggest bronze cut like Barilla 's ultra textured Al Bronzo Mezzi Rigatoni Picky kids love the mild for its sweetness and lack of surprises I also literally beef it up with Pound of Ground beef crumbles or use thin skinned cheese stuffed pastas like Woodstock Organic Four Cheese Tortellini for a no thaw meal in minutes Bonus It also brings out the umami in the sauce For something lighter fresh egg based pasta and zoodles or spaghetti squash work too I add it to soups and veggies and spoon it over frozen pizzas to give them more oomph and up the tomato factor Because of its consistency I can also use it to dip mozzarella sticks garlic bread pizza rolls or chicken tenders It 's also heavenly in an Eggs in Purgatory brunch Buy Vincent 's Medium Tomato Sauce starting at $

subway train operators advises them to make an extremely precise stop so subway doors line up with the gaps between the barriers Your safety is our highest priority and we 're committed to reducing track intrusions and increasing safety the MTA wrote in a post on X. The MTA plans to also try out the barriers in Brooklyn at the West 8th St./NY Aquarium station of the F and Q lines in Coney Island and the Clark St. station on the Nos 2 and 3 lines in Brooklyn Heights A fourth station yet to be determined will also get the barriers MTA officials told the Daily Maryland in December began testing a similar idea on the Baltimore Metro Subway but instead of metal fences the state is installing bollards spaced on platform so they prevent people from stepping into the spaces between train cars Straphangers had mixed feelings Saturday about the barriers debut at W. 191st St. My thought about them was that someone can still push you through the opening so I 'm not sure said commuter Maria Delvalle 34 Leny Disla 52 said the barriers were a waste of time and money I do n't think they 'll make anybody safe Disla said Disla said sliding gated doors which are used in London Paris Tokyo and on other train and subway systems around the world would be a better solution even if they are more expensive to install The MTA in February 2022 announced plans to test safety gates similar to those Disla was thinking about But the agency has yet to act on its plan for a pilot program The JFK AirTrain is the only rail line in New York City to use such technology Another concern is how the barriers might increase crowding said Jeremy Lagual 19 who got his first look at the W. 191st St. barriers on Saturday night If it 's a lot of people around and we all have to get in through the door it 's gon na be hard because it the barrier is in the way said Lagual It should have a better design Lagual concurred with Disla 's criticism something sliding would be better he said Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine who has called for the installation of the sliding safety gates visited the W. 191st St. station on Saturday It does n't provide the protection of full sliding doors Levine said of the new barrier setup But it does give you a sense of security when the train is not in the station You can lean up against it Levine has been calling for the installation of sliding door barriers since the death of Michelle Go 40 who was shoved to her death by a homeless man in January 2022 I 've talked to people who position themselves on the platform to avoid being vulnerable to being pushed Levine said He called the barriers at W. 191st St. a good step forward Similarly straphanger Chandler Forsythe called the barriers at W. 191st St. a starting point It 's very low tech said Forsythe 28 But if it 's a scalable solution that works if the alternative is a few stations have really nice doors and most have none or we have this I think this is a good trade off With Evan Simko Bednarski\", 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/mta-testing-subway-platform-barriers-123000358.html', 'author': 'Julian Roberts-Grmela', 'published_date': '2024-01-21', 'image_link': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QJ..lrAwq1vJj5T2ZdU3Nw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/ny_daily_news_local_423/72c8b56183a47fdd2468a43b8e8d1d77'}, {'id': '6d459cd956de54d39e51b80bf700a54a', 'rank': 31, 'location': 'New York, NY', 'title': 'AllianceBernstein National Municipal Income Fund Inc.

the Courant Many customers have told him the food transports them to Italy Venditti who grew up in Italy and also owns a large restaurant in Sora Italy with his older brother Giuliano Venditti is partners in the Wethersfield restaurant with Sheena Pinott who previously owned a cafe in the same location 446 Silas Deane Highway Pinott who is half Puerto Rican and half Jamaican said her specialty

in New York City 's Flatiron district and from there his brand has flourished He now has 10 restaurants De Rochefort 's tapas restaurants have a bar high tables for dining to continue the bar feel and an open kitchen where guests can view the food action It all flows as it does in Barcelona he said Not only is de Rochefort the taste tester for every dish that goes on the menu he visits restaurants and listens closely to what guests have to say At the helm of creating the shareable dishes recipes for all 10 Boqueria 's is Carlos Sanz the company 's executive chef He said their produce and ingredients are locally sourced for optimal freshness but many other items are imported from Spain including saffron cheeses extra virgin olive oil Iberico ham that is dry aged 48 months white

That Will Keep You Satisfied Per Dietitians', 'excerpt': 'If you want to lose weight faster fill up on filling low calorie foods packed with protein and fiber Here are the best ones according to dietitians', 'summary': \"Behold the ultimate low calorie food the celery stick Many would relegate this simple stalk to rabbits and dieters but that would be a mistake In addition to being one of nature 's lowest calorie foods at about 5 calories a stem it packs a ton of nutrition It 's also thought that certain phytochemicals called phthalides found in celery may relax muscle tissue in artery walls increase blood flow and thereby help lower blood pressure Here 24 more surprisingly low cal foods that offer big nutritional payoffs based on information from The Men 's Health Big Book of Food Nutrition This article was originally published by our partners at RodaleWellness.com Reducing your calorie intake is n't always easy Consuming less food just means you 'll be hungrier right Not necessarily Enjoying nutritious low calorie foods that are actually filling can help keep you satisfied exercise and sleep are important too without a constantly growling stomach In fact focusing just on calorie deficit rather than satisfaction can backfire Consuming all low calorie foods will keep your calorie count low but likely will not keep you full and satisfied This is not ideal because this will cause more hunger and usually leads to excessive snacking and possibly binge eating explains Jessica Zinn M.S. R.D.N. C.D.N. registered dietitian in NY Look for low calorie foods that contain an adequate amount of protein and fiber or consider pairing a lighter food with a good source of healthy fats When fiber protein and fat are consumed together you will be fuller for longer says Zinn Try high fiber carbohydrates like whole grain bread fruit beans and lentils or go for proteins from meat and dairy sources If you follow a vegan or vegetarian diet look for high protein plant based foods Put together a low calorie meal with whole foods like fresh vegetables fruits and proteins for the biggest nutrition bang for your buck rather than processed ones like shakes and supplements says Diana Sugiuchi R.D.N. a registered dietitian focusing on sustainable weight loss Meet the Experts Jessica Zinn M.S. R.D.N. C.D.N. registered dietitian in NY Diana Sugiuchi R.D.N. a registered dietitian focusing on sustainable weight loss Erin Palinski Wade R.D. a nutrition expert in New Jersey Shana Spence M.S. R.D.N. a registered dietitian nutritionist based in New York and Jessica Levinson M.S. R.D.N. C.D.N. culinary nutrition expert in Westchester New York But what foods should you add to your grocery list Here are the best filling low calorie foods to keep stocked in your pantry and fridge to help you reach a weight loss goal or make small tweaks to your existing meal prep plans according to dietitians All kinds of veggies are great for filling you up without adding a ton of calories Sugiuchi says Spinach has less than 7 calories per cup and is virtually flavorless yet loaded with nutrients and antioxidants such as vitamin K manganese folate and magnesium The high fiber pick will make meals more filling and may benefit your digestion Add spinach to salads pastas smoothies and more Celery is one of nature 's lowest cal foods it has about six calories per stalk and it boasts antioxidant and anti inflammatory nutrients Juicing celery may be popular but some dietitians say to enjoy it whole You get nothing unique by juicing celery but you do lose the fiber says Erin Palinski Wade R.D. a nutrition expert in New Jersey And fiber is key for slowing digestion and helping you feel fuller longer As opposed to other breakfast staples oatmeal is shockingly low in calories at just 166 calories per cup cooked Oats are a good source of carbs and fiber and contain more essential amino acids than other grains making them a quality source of protein If your morning bowl does n't quite fill you up try stirring in half a cup of plain nonfat Greek yogurt recommends Shana Spence M.S. R.D.N. a registered dietitian nutritionist based in New York Craving dessert These berries have a naturally sweet taste with very few calories 64 calories per cup)—along with 8 grams of fiber That 's around a third of what you should get in an entire day Raspberries are also a great source of vitamin C which plays an important role in immune function and improves the absorption of iron A favorite of Sugiuchi 's during the colder months Brussels sprouts can be enjoyed raw in a salad not to mention roasted or pan fried with other veggies They offer about 70 calories cup and they 're a great source of the all important fiber and protein Brussels sprouts are especially rich in vitamin K which is necessary for the synthesis of proteins involved in blood clotting and bone metabolism Low fat cottage cheese has about one fifth of the calories you 'll find in most cheeses 163 calories per cup and it 's higher in protein keeping your appetite in check for longer and your metabolism revved Palinski Wade says The type of protein found in cottage cheese called casein has been shown to facilitate muscle recovery when consumed before bed Midnight snack anyone A large egg packs six grams of hunger satisfying protein for just about 70 calories not a bad trade off if you ask us Research shows that eggs can curb your calorie intake at your next meal too In addition to their low cal status eggs are incredibly nutritious and contain a little bit of almost everything you need vitamins minerals you name it Omega-3 enriched and pasture raised eggs tend to be even higher in nutrients Dark leafy greens are definitely worth adding to your diet Sugiuchi says Although kale which only has about 9 calories per cup can be delicious raw in a salad you do n't have to go so crunchy wilt it into pastas or soups for an iron rich boost A single cup also offers over half of your daily value of vitamin K. Research suggests that apples which clock in at about 100 calories per apple are some of the best fruits for weight loss In fact one 2008 study found that participants who added three apples to their usual diet for 10 weeks lost around two pounds You know what they say about an apple a day Fish makes a great staple in weight loss diets Sugiuchi says and flounder is one of the lowest calorie fish out there get just 109 calories per cooked fillet The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommends that adults eat at least 8 ounces of seafood every week so enjoy it alongside a healthy serving of vegetables for a nutrient packed meal Try cucumber as a dipper in place of starchy crackers the next time you make a dip or spread a handful of your favorite chips will pale in comparison to an entire cucumber 's 45 calories Swapping in cukes will also give you a boost of hydration as well as fiber which can help with your digestive health Do n't worry about the slightly elevated level of sugar in carrots They have tons of good vitamin A and lots of fiber so eat up on those Sugiuchi recommends Carrots clock in at just under 30 calories per carrot and yes it 's true that they support good vision Their beta carotene converts to vitamin A in the body which is essential for eye health Want to cut the calories in your sandwich or wrap Swap your bread or tortilla for romaine lettuce either by creating a lettuce wrap or simply chopping up your sandwich ingredients into a salad One cup has just 8 calories compared to around 100 calories per serving for the starchier options Lettuce is a good source of vitamin A and vitamin C both of which are key for healthy skin Shellfish are a diet friendly protein option with under 85 calories per serving They 're also great for bumping up your protein intake meaning they 'll leave you feeling fuller for longer Sugiuchi says Shrimp is also one of the best sources of iodine an important mineral that 's necessary for proper thyroid function But they do have a bit of cholesterol so it 's best to enjoy them in moderation Like spinach and other leafy greens arugula lets you go big on the serving size for very few calories just 5 calories per cup It 's got a fresh peppery flavor that shines in salads It offers about 15 of your daily value of vitamin K which is important for blood clotting and bone health Craving a crunchy snack You could have a handful of potato chips for around 150 calories or a platter of sliced radishes topped with sea salt for just about 10 calories The spicy cruciferous veggies are full of antioxidants like vitamin C which helps battle free radicals and prevent cell damage Black beans are some of the lowest calorie beans you can eat at 109 calories per 1/2 cup Better yet they 're also loaded with protein and fiber a winning combo that can help stave off overeating Spence explains Their fiber combined with a lack of cholesterol also makes them a heart healthy choice just look for varieties without added salt Poultry can pick up extra calories very quickly but boneless skinless chicken breast is actually low in calories when grilled 128 calories per serving Sugiuchi notes It 's a weight loss staple for a reason In addition to protein chicken contains a high amount of selenium a trace mineral necessary for immune function and thyroid health Like oranges they 're a tasty tangy treat But unlike their larger cousins each of these little citrus fruits has just 35 calories Plus fruit beats processed desserts by miles The snack size treat is also loaded with vitamin C clocking about 40 of your daily value in just one fruit Asparagus which has less than 20 calories in half a cup is rich in insoluble fiber which research suggests can thwart the release of hunger hormones and help keep your blood sugar stable It also just happens to be one of the easiest sides to make and eat You might not associate pork with the phrase low calorie but cuts like tenderloin are actually super lean with about 120 calories per serving And thanks to 22.3 grams of protein you 're guaranteed to feel satisfied after your meal Pork tenderloin has also received the American Heart Association Heart Check Certification meaning it 's extra lean and can be part of a heart healthy diet Strawberries which have about 50 calories per cup are rich in a special type of fiber called pectin It can help slow digestion and allow you to feel fuller longer Palinski Wade explains It also slows the release of sugar into the bloodstream helping to prevent hunger triggering blood sugar spikes Unlike most other salty snacks air popped popcorn is pretty low in calories Each air popped cup has about 30 calories and a bit of filling fiber Plus a 2012 study suggests that it 's actually more satisfying than competing finger foods Air popped and lightly seasoned this whole grain is actually a healthy snack According to the American Heart Association high fiber whole grains have been linked to a lower risk of heart disease diabetes and some cancers There are only 27 calories in a cup of the crisp green pods but there 's a ton of different ways to use them Whether you enjoy them raw or toss them in a salad stir fry or pasta they 're sure to hit the spot Like many of the other fruits and veggies on this list it 's full of the antioxidant vitamin C. Melons like cantaloupe have a high water content so they 'll fill you up for very few calories says Spence Case in point An entire cup of cantaloupe is just 54 calories Cantaloupe is full of the carotenoid beta carotene which gives the fruit its orange hue Zucchini and its close cousin yellow squash has a super low calorie count—27 calories per cup and loads of culinary potential Do n't be afraid to get creative or go for seconds It contains an ample amount of vitamin A about 40 of your daily value in one cup of cooked zucchini which is great for eye health They might taste indulgent but one serving of scallops has a measly number of calories just 94 calories in 3 ounces Try this recipe for a pan seared scallop salad Despite the low calorie count scallops are rich in omega-3 fatty acids heart healthy fats that will help keep you full too Cauliflower is a good source of vitamin C potassium and plant based omega-3 fatty acids and this versatile veggie can be used in place of higher carb foods in some of your favorite dishes One cup of cooked cauliflower has just under 30 calories and its mild taste can be seasoned in so many tasty ways With a firm hearty texture it 's main dish worthy Not only is watermelon a great sweet treat to have on a hot day it also boasts many benefits for your skin And for just 46 calories per cup this fruit is a great low cal option for an afternoon snack Nuts can be considered low calorie when eaten in moderation Sugiuchi says so stick to the serving size For almonds that 's one ounce or about 23 nuts which contains 164 calories They 're a great source of protein and healthy fats but a little goes a long way One medium pear has 100 calories and 6 grams of satiating fiber about 21 of the recommended daily value for fiber says Jessica Levinson M.S. R.D.N. C.D.N. culinary nutrition expert in Westchester New York The fiber is found in the skin so be sure not to peel your pears before eating Research shows that obesity rates are lower in consumers who eat fresh pears and eating three pears a day increased weight loss significantly In addition to enjoying pears as a snack add them to salads bake or poach them for dessert or purée them to make pear sauce Levinson suggests Pistachios are the only nut that is a complete protein and you get the most bang for your buck says Levinson 1 ounce of pistachios has 160 calories per 49 nuts which is a larger portion size than other nuts Research shows she adds that pistachio consumption is associated with increased fiber intake decreased consumption of sweets and reduced body weight When snacking on pistachios choose in shell pistachios when possible suggests Levinson The process of taking them out of the shell will slow you down leaving you feeling more satiated Try adding them to salads or chop them and use in place of breadcrumbs as a coating for chicken or fish Along with having less than 100 calories a typical container of nonfat plain Greek yogurt also has 14 grams of protein so it will leave you feeling satisfied I recommend adding some berries for a bit of sweetness and fiber while still keeping calorie count low says Zinn Turkey jerky is another great low calorie snack with 60 calories per serving specifically jerky sticks because they are single- serve and portable says Zinn They also have 6 grams of protein per serving which will help to keep you full for longer she adds This often forgotten sea vegetable with 45 calories per cup provides freshness and umami to dishes It 's loaded with iodine and is great frozen in smoothies salads and seafood dishes\", 'link': 'https://www.yahoo.com/lifestyle/30-low-calorie-foods-help-153400129.html', 'author': 'Samantha MacAvoy', 'published_date': '2024-01-22', 'image_link': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/2H2yydCUZYlqws.b.fxERQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/hearst_prevention_66/7e16b9c60db8e627b4ce47e8b37ce9ea'}, {'id': '8c498af3381fec528a35ed0ecf23f6d9', 'rank': 31, 'location': 'New York, NY', 'title': 'Optical Imaging Systems Market Size Share Projected to Hit USD 5.62 Billion By 2032 With a Growth of 11.1 CAGR Report by Polaris Market Research', 'excerpt': 'The global optical imaging systems market size and share is currently valued at USD 2.19 billion in 2023 It is anticipated to generate an estimated revenue of USD 5.62 billion by 2032 according to', 'summary': \"The global optical imaging systems market size and share is currently valued at USD 2.19 billion in 2023 It is anticipated to generate an estimated revenue of USD 5.62 billion by 2032 according to the latest study by Polaris Market Research Besides the report notes that the market exhibits a robust 11.1 Compound Annual Growth Rate CAGR over the forecasted timeframe 2024 2032 The global players include Abbott PerkinElmer Carl Zeiss Meditec Leica Microsystems Canon Optovue Corp.

been criticized from Georgia to Northern California for employee behavior massive surprise bills and slow response times', 'summary': \"When the public found out that a patient was forced to the sidewalk on Norton Street and left to collapse on the ground it raised immediate concerns Flabbergasted was the word Rochester Mayor Malik Evans used to describe his feelings A longer term question swirled in the community too Would Rochester EMS serve residents better if it was run by the city and not a contractor In the incident that recently came to light a Black Rochester man struggling to breathe was made to leave an ambulance in north central on Nov. 30 not far from one of the city 's neighborhood service centers EMT workers from contractor AMR claimed he was being unruly In the video of the incident the patient told them he was just trying to find air What happened in the ambulance is not clear The man collapsed on the sidewalk and was left unaided for more than two minutes He died in the hospital two weeks before Christmas although the cause of death has n't been shared The Rochester community has been doing soul searching since the tragedy was made public Questions about services for citizens and about the contractor under fire in some other parts of the nation appear likely to persist After the incident AMR contacted the New York State Department of Health Bureau of EMS and Trauma Systems and requested a formal investigation The crew is on leave AMR is not commenting on the Nov. 30 event Emergency medical services nationwide remain under immense pressure from growing demand due to a lack of mental health and social services programs coupled with significant staffing shortages exacerbated by the pandemic a spokesperson for American Medical Response said There are lessons to be learned Mayor Evans said at a Jan. 11 press conference Particularly to what types of medical services or ambulance services our community are experiencing Suppose you live in Rochester and call 911 for an ambulance Emergency help often is dispatched but it 's not a city crew that shows up A company called Rural Metro is the responder unless you specifically ask for another service according to the city 's official website In 2015 Rural Metro merged with American Medical Response a private national ambulance company owned by the private equity firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts Co. Our EMT partners at AMR do not report to me Mayor Evans said They have a contract with us and city council has to approve that contract The four year contract expires Nov. 30 You need an organization that 's large enough to handle a city like Rochester and AMR has been that partner Barbara Pierce the director of the city 's communications City councilmember Stanley Martin says the council city attorneys and the administration have had confidential meetings around the new AMR contract negotiations We have n't yet seen a copy of what the new proposed contract includes Martin said I believe the city should strongly consider investing in its own tax funded municipal ambulatory service Under these conditions calling for reform is not enough We know these systems can not be reformed because we 've tried for decades and yet they keep killing us In 1981 the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act discontinued federal funding for EMS services replacing it with block grants allocated to states for preventive health services This transition resulted in the transfer of EMS responsibility from the federal to the state level Once states had more control over the funding most spent the money in areas of need other than EMS Unlike the airline industry where the FAA holds jurisdiction no federal agency oversees ambulance services Instead each state has regulations that EMS services must follow to maintain compliance Dia Gainer has been the executive director of the National Association of State EMS Officials for 13 years and oversaw Idaho 's EMS regulations for 19 years Gainer said states do n't care whether the EMS services are public private faith based or non profit as long as they comply with the state 's minimum requirements for vehicles required medicine and sufficient staff to respond to calls 24/7 Speaking on the choice jurisdictions make on EMS models she said It could be the tendency of the city or town to privatize certain city services The answer is not different in EMS than it is for any other city service Rochester is one of many American municipalities that outsource EMS to private companies Yonkers does Cities with comparable populations to Rochester such as Des Moines Iowa and Fayetteville North Carolina provide public EMS services through their fire departments In larger cities like Philadelphia public services and exclusive licensing for private options are combined When a city provides EMS and ambulance service often within its fire rescue operations it hosts a large workforce equipment ongoing maintenance fuel costs billing services and insurance This is paid for by the taxpayers just like other beneficial civic services like roads and schools By contracting out EMS services municipalities sidestep the need to establish the infrastructure and manage the expenses of ambulance service maintenance They also avoid the month to month responsibility for the equity and quality of the life saving care supposedly being offered to a 911 caller And they pay the company a hefty chunk of taxpayer dollars A National Library of Medicine report in the past could not find evidence that one way of handling EMS is better But the report dates back to 1998 before private equity firms started acquiring EMS companies as part of their portfolios The trend gained momentum around 2008 when these companies anticipated President Barack Obama 's health care policies would result in more insured Americans meaning more customers The business strategy of numerous private equity firms might at times mean cutting expenses and increasing prices for customers showing the conflict of balancing the need to generate profits against providing care for folks during life threatening moments according to national experts The nationwide shortage of EMTs and paramedics also undermines the condition of private EMS companies In comparison to other healthcare industries EMS personnel pay is likely to be lower Dia Gainer said If you need six people for the next 12 hours and one person calls in sick you 've just taken out 33 percent of your ambulances According to Gainer a former paramedic who worked for 12 years in the suburbs of Philadelphia and Baltimore pay is one of many reasons for the shortage It 's one of the toughest jobs in the world Gainer said To interact with people during the worst moment in their life and distraught family members at 2 a.m. when you have n't slept in 20 hours it sucks the life out of you Research indicates that the likelihood of accidents and errors increases significantly among EMTs and paramedics when the workforce is not adequately rested The National Association of State EMS Officials developed fatigue risk management guidelines in response to the profession 's challenges The guidelines resemble those that restrict an airline crew from operating for two consecutive flights without a specified period of rest in between However as there are no federal regulations governing Emergency Medical Services it is the responsibility of each state to establish and enforce such guidelines EMS may not be a viable option for the upcoming generation of workers You could also say farming fishing Gainer said People in the family have done it two or three generations and come to a realization that this is not healthy economically or personally Nationally AMR has received some criticism and complaints from DeKalb County Georgia to Northern California for employee behavior massive surprise bills and slow response times AMR has been sued in San Mateo California for alleged sexual assaults County officials in Portland Oregon launched an investigation into AMR over mounting public issues AMR values its relationships with the communities we serve nationwide a spokesperson for the company said We are acutely aware of the systemic challenges being faced by EMS providers In an effort to address these challenges AMR is actively engaged in making meaningful and significant investments in new and innovative programs In a city like Rochester where AMR is the primary ambulance provider and has years of experience operating it 's challenging for a local government to end a contract without another trusted service ready to take its place City Councilmember Stanley Martin believes the Rochester community does n't have to only consider privatization At this juncture all options have to be thoroughly considered Martin said We must engage in the difficult yet necessary work of building new systems of care that recognize our humanity and support our existence The community is in uproar said Dr. Dwight Fowler president of the United Christian Leadership Ministry and civil and human- rights organization Fowler hosted a press conference on Jan. 18 at First Church of God where he serves as pastor to condemn the behavior of AMR emergency medical technicians and Rochester police officers seen on video apparently failing to notice The camera speaks for itself Fowler said There seemed to be no genuine concern for him no sensitivity he said I 'm 100 percent opposed to any paramedic public or private treating someone the way this person was treated The reverend compared the imagery to the Daniel Prude video an incident where Rochester Police placed a spit hood on a Black man experiencing a mental health crisis Prude died as a result of the encounter and the memory is still fresh in the public mind There are chilling similarities between the AMR incident and the killing of Daniel Prude councilmember Stanley Martin said Especially as it relates to the role of RPD in abusing their power and hiding information from the public and the role of AMR staff in treating a patient with complete disregard and callousness Martin was at the front of the protest after the Prude incident before winning a seat on the city council Nearly four years later finding ourselves in a position where our first responders still devalue the life of a Black man is enraging and heartbreaking she

state of constant shock What Southwest Floridians are saying about traffic', 'excerpt': 'The News Press and Naples Daily News are kicking of Traffic Week today where we are listening to you and providing context on where we are', 'summary': \"A nerve has been touched Several weeks ago the -Press and Naples Daily connected with our audience base The mission to find out what was on their minds with regard to transportation in Southwest Florida or more specifically the slow crawling traffic you run into just about everywhere you travel More than 200 emails have come to us We are not surprised The emails were written by people like all of us A real estate agent A doctor A Ph.D. A retired electrician from New York named Rich Mulhern who said It 's not rocket science We can send man to the moon and beyond but we ca n't make traffic flow in a coordinated manner on most of these roads But in many ways our traffic woes can be looked at as rocket science especially when one considers things such as the rapid growth taking place in our corner of the world Or the fact that we have a wave of people tourists and snowbirds who visit here from other places adding more congestion not to mention their unfamiliarity with our roads Or challenges with synchronizing lights Or bad signage One expert 's point of view Our traffic crisis Why has it gotten so bad Expert answers questions looks to future These are only some of the reasons people provided in their emails to us about why they think traffic is so bad here All are valid points Our editors and reporters recently brainstormed a series of stories that are focused on SWFL 's traffic challenges We are calling it Traffic Week It kicks off today and will continue through Sunday on our websites and in the newspapers We will cover a wide range of topics that we think we will interest you And we had some fun Check out later this week a story by our arts and entertainment reporter Charles Runnells on the best songs to listen to if you are in a traffic jam Trending reporter Samantha Neely has a humorous take on our traffic with some memes she created that will make you burst out in laughter We also plan to have a virtual roundtable with traffic experts from Collier and Lee counties and Cape Coral And you will able to see see many of the emails we received in full in our letters to the editor pages in the -Press and Naples Daily on Wednesday Jan. 24 and Saturday Jan. 27 They will also appear on our websites The bottom line There is definitely higher levels of anxiety when it comes to driving here There are enough traffic problems to make you stay home and reconsider your sanity for even considering it said Trevor Tibstra We 've stopped going out for dinner rather we 're ordering DoorDash because of the nightmare of traffic Lived in Naples since the 90s and miss what it used to be like Jeanne Malone said I am in a state of constant shock at going out to do anything because of the beyond belief crush of auto traffic I never ever put on my list of things to do in life to sit in clumps of endless traffic for what remained of my life Sally Wortman I feel very strongly that the present commissioners could at the very least start to fix the messes they have created by rubber stamping every new development without careful thought for what it might produce I can not blame the people who moved here in search of what I do not know as much as I do blame these glib commissioners Our intention is to do what we can to help knowing there are no quick fixes The hope is that future planning is in place to address these matters accordingly from Cape Coral to Marco Island If nothing else we 'd like to keep Susan Scavelli and her husband happily married Here is what Susan told us in her email And btw the only time my husband and I argue and swear is when we 're driving anywhere around SW Florida she said We get it Susan We have all been there Now here 's a summary of some of the emails we received A closer look at whom people want to blame aggressive drivers solutions pet peeves and worst intersections What 's happening in Collier Traffic woes Collier County commissioner pitches moratorium on larger developments out east Helicopter parents driving kids to and from school Ride the bus kids After school programs to spread out school pick up said Jim Taylor Short and sweet Major improvement in traffic would result with Drivers putting down their phone Phillip HInkle said Cyclists in Old Naples They hold up traffic and are a hazard plus someone is going to get hit I 'm afraid Cindy Thompson said The influx of drivers from the Northeast has materially altered life here in SWFL Horns piggybacking four- way stops cutting off drivers not allowing lane changes and generally being aggressive are all imports associated with the MA NY NJ CT plates said Mark R Aschliman I think pick up truck drivers are the most dangerous because they have this big vehicle they think they 're invincible If the limit is 50 they do 80 Robert Gerlicher said Everyone will agree that traffic is the worst it has ever been But more frightening is the increasing level of speeding and aggressive driving I experience it on a daily basis whether it 's on route 41 side streets or in the Publix parking lot It 's scary out there Phil Lowenhaupt said The red light runners are particularly concerning One of our friends was almost killed by a red light runner And God forbid you should stop for a yellow light You always have to look behind you to ensure the driver will stop if you do One of my friends says she 's not going out on the roads on Saturdays anymore because the traffic is so bad Further there should be stiffer penalties for aggressive driving including suspending licenses and impounding cars for a period of time said Marg Ivanisko One near term improvement would be revamping the current poorly timed traffic lights a countywide problem to improve the flow of traffic A second is to put an end to the dangerous and pervasive running of red lights especially when they are changing have changed from yellow to red It is not unusual to see 2 6 vehicles run a red light Late left turns are particularly dangerous Craig Olson wrote It is absolutely ridiculous that all school buses and hazardous materials vehicles have to stop for all the railroad crossings throughout Estero These tracks have not been in service for years It is not only inconvenient it is downright dangerous A simple solution to the problem is to have the state erect signs that say Tracks out of Service and post them at all these crossings Another solution would be to have the railroad take down all the signals and take the RR signs off the pavement said Susan Yoder Reduce commuter times and encourage car pooling Provide incentives to commuters to obtain housing closer to work Shift normal working hours to earlier or later Jim Taylor said The Collier County and Naples area appear to be attractive areas for relocation But what is the point if you can not leave your neighborhood There are plans to improve the flow traffic but my understanding is that most of them ten years out How about this as a partial solution Forbid the Collier County commissioners from issuing any additional building permits until they present a concrete plan for road construction and traffic improvement said Bruce Foster The worst part of SW FL traffic for me is the aggressive drivers I see so many dangerous drivers but never any law enforcement there to enforce the laws Texting while driving speeding running lights etc We raised our family here since 1985 The traffic is so congested now yet there is constant new construction There needs to be speed limit reductions since there is such an abundance of cars on the roads said Deborah Pettersen Traffic cameras at the lights Do you know how much money Lee County could make It would sure help the deficit lost in taxes from Ian said Janie McKie Waiting for the light to turn green again in S.W. Florida It 's totally ridiculous they overpopulated the gateway to the Everglades because of Greed Rich Mulhern My pet peeves are the tailgaters The ones that are right up your butt What is wrong with these people Jacqueline Montana Slow lane hogging drivers prevent us from changing lanes especially with out of state plates You know they just dilly dally along while we who live here need to get to work Susan Scavelli Drivers speeding through red lights and not making full stops at stop signs Ann Marie Israel Out of Towner 's who cut you off in traffic go very slow especially in the left lane- or even better come to a dead stop Kathleen Stevens Very few people use their turn signals when turning or changing lanes It makes driving scary because you never know when someone is going to try and cut into your lane which they often do recklessly Dora Shedden Intersection of Old 41 and US 41 is frequently backed up a half mile or more during rush hour John McIntyre Pine Ridge Road on Naples between Livingston and all the way to Tamiami Trail Dale Johnson Pretty much everywhere on Pine Island Road Jacqueline Montana Tamiami and Immokalee Fred Hertel Frankly any intersection involving rush hour traffic between 41 and 75 to the east and west and Immokalee and Golden Gate Parkway to the north and south is a problem Van Z. Williams Jr. In my opinion any intersection that ties in to Pine Ridge Road is the worst Susan Chase Fifth Ave S crossing 41 to downtown Fifth Ave district in Naples They need to somehow widen this area to people going downtown for theatre restaurants and shopping Carol Mulhernj Airport Road and Pine Ridge Road Bill Hoffman Colonial Boulevard in Fort Myers The left turn on to Six Mile Cypress The shopping dining and entertainment Top Golf has caused a real snafu Drivers must wait several light cycles to make left turn The ONLY solution is a flyover to replace the traffic light and allow traffic to proceed in an orderly fashion This should have been implemented before any further construction was permitted Robert Grosso The intersection at Vanderbilt and Airport Pulling Road is obnoxious and the one at Orange Blossom and Airport is downright dangerous Jeanne Malone The top three worst intersections with no solution in sight Daniels Treeline in Fort Myers Daniels Six Mile Cypress in Fort Myers and Colonial Six Mile Cypress in Fort Myers Sally Harrison Pepper Gladiolus and 41 by Lowes Susan Scavelli Del Prado and Cape Coral Parkway Michael Lanner The intersection of 41 and Bonita Beach Rd is treacherous and probably the worst intersection I encounter Cindy White Why left turns onto 75 Where else are there left turns onto a busy interstate Morris Copper All of the corners with round abouts a since very few drivers have any idea of the rules laws for using them Michael Bingman I live at The Landings College at McGregor in Fort Myers Heading north on McGregor traffic backs up for Cape Coral bridge and McGregor 's two lane street is slow going north and scary to reenter Judi Archdale State road 82 Where it intersects with Sunshine Boulevard in Lehigh Acres Amber Gallegos Mooring Line Drive and US 41 One could take a nap at that traffic light They must have a deal with the city Turns 41 into a parking lot Kathleen Stevens Finally this email from Scott Zumstein We saved it for last because we think Mr. Zumstein did a good job summarizing where we are and where we are going We exist in a perfect storm of retirees working classes at every level of income seasonal snowbirds tourists and the worst the double platers two license plates their own other state vehicles as I call them Those are the reasons to be in our wonderful county but who 's behind the wheel The secret ingredient to the perfect storm the drivers comprising of seniors teenagers and the out of towners all moving at their own pace The solution for us being 43 years as full time residents is to stay out of the fray know the travel patterns and timing Or do n't venture out Safety first Amen to that This article originally appeared on Fort Myers -Press Traffic jams in lee and collier county have residents frustrated\", 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/am-state-constant-shock-southwest-100317589.html', 'author': 'Mark H.

Call', 'summary': \"Daniel Dougherty Chief Financial Officer Executive Vice President Metropolitan Bank Holding Corp Operator Good day and welcome to the Metropolitan Commercial Bank fourth quarter and full year 2023 earnings call Hosting the call today from Metropolitan Commercial Bank are Mark DeFazio President and Chief Executive Officer and Dan Dougherty Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Today 's call is being recorded Operator Instructions During today 's presentation references will be made to the company 's earnings release and investor presentation copies of which are available at mcbankny.com Today 's presentation may include forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially Please refer to the company 's notices regarding forward looking statements and non GAAP measures that appear in the earnings release It is now my pleasure to turn the floor over to Mark DeFazio President and Chief Executive Officer You may begin Thank you Todd Good morning and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter earnings call MCB 's ability to manage through severe banking sector stress in 2023 while simultaneously exiting less material lines of business demonstrates the impressive strength and stability of MCB 's franchise We have been able to responsibly grow the balance sheet while maintaining our credit standards and with a continued sharp focus on liquidity interest rate risk management Importantly the economy continues to display impressive resilience and calls for a steep recession have become less apparent over time That said 2023 was a challenging year for the banking industry The effects of the most aggressive Fed tightening cycle in decades and an inverted yield curve created significant headwinds Thankfully experts predict that we have seen the end of the tightening cycle and many are convinced that an easing cycle is on the horizon MCB being modestly liability sensitive will benefit from the monetary policy easing Turning to recent results I am pleased with MCB 's performance in the fourth quarter and for year end 2023 NIM inflected in the fourth quarter where we saw modest expansion ending what turned out to be only two quarters of compression We expect NIM expansion to continue in 2024 supported by continued loan growth originated at consistent spreads and funded with core deposits from our growing roster of deposit verticals Asset quality remains strong with no identifiable broad negative trends in any loan product geography or sector Looking forward we are excited to formally announce that we have begun our core banking modernization initiative We expect that this project will result in improved capabilities and efficiencies for both customer facing and internal processes Dan will provide financial details on the digital transformation project I will now turn the call over to our CFO Dan Dougherty Daniel Dougherty Thank you Mark and good morning everyone I am pleased to join my first conference call as CFO of Metropolitan Bank and I look forward to meeting with all of you at future conferences and investor events As Mark mentioned the operating environment continues to be quite challenging However despite rate related headwinds the changing dynamics of depositor behavior and a material shift in the bank 's funding profile we have continued to deploy our capital prudently and profitably For the year earnings per share was $ 6.91 and our book value per share at year end was $ 58.69 As we transition to 2024 we are optimistic about the path of the economy and the direction of short term interest rates Even though many challenges remain we believe that the 2024 earnings will show solid growth relative to 2023.Quarter over quarter we saw an increase of $ 270 million in the loan book a growth of approximately 5 Net interest income was up $ 3.4 million or about 6.4 driving an increase in the net interest margin of 9 basis points Our ability to reach an inflection point in the name is remarkable when you consider that we offloaded $ 475 million in crypto related DDA balances during the year Loan growth was funded primarily by a deposit growth of $ 215 million The deposited verticals that contribute the most to that growth were municipals loan customer deposits and EB-5 related deposits The remainder of balance sheet growth during the year during quarter excuse me which included increases in both cash and securities was funded through wholesale channels Liquidity risk management remains a key focus At year end total secured borrowing capacity was approximately 200 of our estimate of uninsured deposits Our loan pipelines remained strong A continued focus on pricing discipline resulted in a weighted average coupon net of deferred fees of 8.7 on fourth quarter new loan originations versus a September loan portfolio yield of 6.73%.The loan book mix continues to shift towards fixed rate as the mix of recent originations has been more heavily weighted towards fixed As well recent payoffs have been weighted towards float Now a few comments on credit As Mark mentioned asset quality remains strong with no identifiable negative trends within the portfolio We did however provision $ 6.5 billion in the fourth quarter The increased provision was driven primarily by loan growth as well as a specific reserve connected with outstandings to a single sponsor that went non accrual in December all of that offset somewhat by improvements in the macroeconomic variables that underlie our CECL model Although we saw an increase in NPLs in the fourth quarter we are confident that the ultimate risk of loss in the NPL book is minimal because of strong sponsor guarantees and collateral values that are generally well aligned with outstandings Non interest income was flat over the quarter at $ 6.5 million Within the non interest income bucket GPG revenues were also flat at $ 4.2 million Importantly due to evolving regulatory environment that has challenged the cost benefit equation related to the business to consumer or B2C fintech business the bank has decided to exit B2C. The plan is to complete the B2C exit over the course of this year The implications of the B2C exit are focused on the GPG fee revenue outlook and the impact from the outflow of low cost deposits The overall fee revenue decline related to the B2C exit should equate to approximately 2 to 3 of the current consensus 2024 revenue forecast The related deposit outflows which will also occur over the course of the year are expected to be immaterial to 2024 results We remain committed to grow the GPG business line especially as a source of low cost funding But for the time being we think a focus on the business to business or B2B is appropriate We do not plan on any specific headcount reduction as a result of the B2C exit As opportunities present themselves existing employees will work to support new deposit gathering initiatives Now let 's talk about noninterest noninterest expenses After adjusting for the negative regulatory settlement reversal of 3 million in the third quarter quarter over quarter 96 non interest expense was up approximately 3 million of the $ 1 million increase in fourth quarter comp and benefits reflects the timing of third quarter hires and some one time charges related to placement fees and severance costs We will continue to invest in human capital this year as we prepare for our continued approach towards $ 10 billion in balance sheet footing The 2024 run rate for comp and benefits will reflect an increase to annualized fourth quarter expense of approximately 6 to 8 Professional fees should trend down towards $ 4 million per quarter over the course of the year And finally in the aggregate it is reasonable to assume that total core noninterest expense will increase in the 10 to 12 area versus normalized 2023 expenses A few comments on the banking modernization project Onetime costs associated with the core banking modernization project are expected to total approximately 9.5 million in 2024 These expenses will be somewhat lumpy throughout the year We will make best efforts to report core as well as project related expenses Each quarter The modernization project is planned to be implemented over a roughly 24 month period Approximately 80 of the total project spend is expected to occur in 2020 for the returns on the returns on the project which are measured largely through scalability data mining ability improve payment processing capabilities and improved customer experience will be evident as we integrate the new systems I will now turn to call back to the operator for Q&A. Operator At this time the floor is now open for your questions If you have a question or comment please press star one on your telephone keypad If at any point your question has been answered you may remove yourself from the queue by pressing star two Again we do ask that you pose your question to pick up your handset to provide optimal sound quality Again that 's star one to ask a question Our first question comes from Mark Fitzgibbon of Piper Sandler Daniel Dougherty Please go ahead Hey guys Good morning Morning locks The watermark for First question I had for you Dan around that the exit of the B to C business You know two questions related to that First what was sort of the impetus for exiting the business and second of the 781 million of GPG deposits roughly what how much of that is connected TV PTC Hugh this is Mark I 'll take the first half of that So So Mark just to bring you up to date on this of MCB has n't brought on a B to C Cline and GPG throughout all of 22 and all of 23 And we just started socializing this and talking about it publicly So we have not recognized any benefit from B to C business for the last two years on the reason for it is the economics You know at this point the regulatory expectations for that oversight is extraordinary and it 's costly And we 're just fortunate fortunate enough to have other options to choose to grow grow the bank So we have decided that the economics to profit margins on that business used to be very substantial They have served us well And for everyone listening we were in that business for two decades very successfully So it has served the bank Well it just no longer has the risk reward or the economics to support staying in the business?Dan you want to think Yes Daniel Dougherty So Mark the deposits that are of the B. two C. deposits foot to about 250 million Those will we 'll exit the bank The plan is to exit the bank over the course of the 12 months of 2024.Okay great And then can you share with us any thoughts on the pipeline in the B2B business how that 's looking right now shaping up Yes it 's strong It 's strong it 's diverse And we also have acquiring which we stood up in 2023 which we expect a 24 to for it to start to contribute meaningfully in 24 as well as far as the 250000 in deposits market we have already demonstrated and over the last 24 months we had the life of about 1 billion and a half of crypto related deposits that fully left the bank and we had replaced them very efficiently from So we would expect on it to be a nonevent on the 250 million It will not happen in one moment It will happen gradually over the year And I do n't think you 'll end up noticing it at all Daniel Dougherty Okay And then just two modeling things One on the margin You mentioned the margin should rise throughout the course of 2024 Assuming you follow the forward curve how much how much new expansion does that imply And also if you could share any color on the effective tax rate going forward Daniel Dougherty Thank you It may So our forecast has two rate hikes in it for next year They come in the middle of middle to the back of the year and we see another 10 10 to 15 basis points of Nymex Nymex?Well actually 20 basis points of expansion through the course of the year based on that model Okay great And then the effective rate was low low this quarter but sort of back at 31 and change you think is a more reasonable go forward rate Daniel Dougherty That 's a good assumption Yes Daniel Dougherty Thank you Operator Thank you Our next question comes from Mick Could you rally with Hubdoc Daniel Dougherty Please go ahead Good morning everyone How are you wanting to do more than that Just to follow up on the expense commentary or the project related expenses that you mentioned incorporated into the 10 to 12 projected growth rate Daniel Dougherty They are not if you were to include those What does the projected growth rate for 24 versus 23 look like and I have to come back to you on that one Nick I do n't have it handy in front of me I could do quick math but let me I may follow up with you on that No problem Tom on the deposit front you mentioned nice growth in the municipal book We had a similar dynamic in the year ago quarter Is this mainly due to seasonality or have you added significant new relationships into that vertical but mostly new relationships primarily driving driven by new relations Daniel Dougherty That 's right Wonderful loan growth was again strong And even in spite of strong deposit growth it looks like you added more wholesale funding to support that rise When do you anticipate you 'll be able to drive down borrowings to levels that are more in line with your history Daniel Dougherty The plan is yesterday of course but but but you know I remember at year end our cash position was was elevated and that was intentional So those dollars can quickly leave the bank I do n't need to run a cash that was quite that high So I would think you know that should be pretty quick over the course of the year that we drive this thing back towards the current minimum which is around which is 300 million which is which is which is actually swapped out So that 's going to stick with us for the duration of those swaps which which expire in mid 25 I believe And so I yes Again I think it should happen relatively quickly as we ramp up our deposits gathering process But Nick year over year if you look at the difference between core funding and net new loan growth there was it was minimal We did n't really rely at all heavily at all on wholesale funding to fund that growth Right right And then lastly another solid rise in the health care portfolio this quarter where you comfortable bringing that book as an overall percentage of total loans We 're studying that right now We 're having stress test as you know as you As you know we do stress testing of the entire portfolio twice a year but having a targeted stress test done on the health care I have a sense of where that 's going to come out will be very positive and we like the risk profile there So we we 'll announce some new numbers on at some point but we 're going through that analysis now in the first quarter but we do like the risk profile and the economics around healthcare Remember it 's a very diversified portfolio It 's just not skilled nursing homes and assisted living facilities I appreciate the color and thank you for taking my questions Daniel Dougherty Thanks Nick Thanks Thank you Operator Our next question comes from Chris O'Connell with KBW Please go ahead and Hey good morning Tony Cristello And just wanted to circle back to the guidance of the 20 basis points and just confirm that 's off of the 4Q 23 for Q. 20 for time line numbers not off of the annual meeting it starts actually off the annual minutes So that 's so that 's RUB20 billion in 2020 and 20 basis points above the 30 40 Daniel Dougherty That 's correct Rate And how much does that change I guess you know the rate if there 's no Fed cuts next year I do n't have that handy Happy to run the model and let you know just one other way of looking at that to Nick is we have some very big deposit initiatives that should drive lower cost deposits throughout 2024 So we 're not just relying on the Fed to give us some expansion here We 're driving it ourselves as we have historically And you saw in this year that just passed we had only two quarters of compression with the kind of tightening that we face So we 're not relying on the Fed The Fed has many more cuts predicted We only have two in our projections but it is not the underpinning of that margin compression That margin expansion we saw is our deposit initiatives Daniel Dougherty Yes So the NIM forecast that my team has produced it that adds relatively conservative assumptions related to core deposit growth So and if anything there 's there should be upside there assuming that the past administered rates is generally aligned with what we 've talked about they come in on the B to CAZE I appreciate all the color that you guys gave And as far as the actual impact to the GBG fee line And do you have what that is I guess on an annual basis once the exits complete And then any sense of just even if it 's you know rough the timing of that how that will play out Daniel Dougherty Again the agency is going to happen during the course of 2020 for the reason like I couched it in terms of forecasted revenue for next year is to emphasize the fact that it 's a relatively small number It 's 2 to 3 of consensus right now for 2024 So you know that you can do the math I can do the math that 's call it five to 6 billion It 's going to be the delta there Got it and Great Daniel Dougherty And then I guess Hi this is Chris from Chris because keep in mind um just one thing that should n't be not focused on As I mentioned earlier we did n't bring in We have onboarded a B to C client and GPG 's revenues not only absorbed the material reduction in crypto related transaction revenues We put not only replaced that seamlessly We replaced on the lack of revenue coming from B to C as well by adding new B2B clients So the underpinning of that business is strong and it 's unfortunate that we 're replacing some some some some opportunities there for a lot of different reasons but we are not coming out of a hole because we are replacing it as we as we speak and we demonstrated it again in 23 Daniel Dougherty Great And just buying the multi family provision how big was that a credit And can you give any color just around the overall circumstances what the total reserve loan size is just any other detail surrounding the credit and it 's multifamily outside of New York I think it 's Ohio and on Louisiana Louisiana what as what we understand it 's a dispute between partners and the lack of willingness to put capital into the projects to bring them to be stabilized on So it 's not something we have n't seen in our careers before considering the sponsorship behind that We 're a little bit surprised on that dumb But considering how well do they are and how experienced they are in this asset class that they would run the risk of litigation of them but they are what we are confident of We believe the risk of loss here is minimal Why I actually believe the risk of loss here is here Daniel Dougherty Great And do you have what the LTV or debt service coverage ratio was on the credit gone in their most recent Well they were properties in transition So if they were not highly occupied that was the value proposition of acquiring it at a very high cap rate going in renovate stabilize and the typical model of multi families you go and you acquire you stabilize you renovate you stabilize rates come down cap rates come down you refinance or sell at a higher a higher return and they just rates are likely to come down but they 're not finishing the renovation So the debt service coverage is almost irrelevant because of the guarantee and the global cash flow of the guarantors which supported the projects on the way in the LTVs were project were 70 I 'm sure within policy guidelines 70 75 I 'm sure Daniel Dougherty Great And just last one on this I do know when it was originated And I think on the inside of two years 2022 21 2020 or 2020 whenever clients Great and just D do you view this as a read through to any other parts of the portfolio And how are you guys seeing credit transform over the past quarter and kind of the outlook going forward And does it impact any of your appetite for loan growth going forward of note just as I said in my prepared remarks this is income indicative of any trend or anything that 's happening in the portfolio from a asset class perspective or geography And this is a one off situation And keep in mind we do a fair amount of lending here you will have not the NPLs from time to time The question is your underwriting will get tested when you have nine PLs and you 'll feel throughout the course of the year how our underwriting bid as a result of remediating this problem I can tell you the clients are fully engaged and now they are talking to us So I would expect this to get resolved one way or the other pretty soon Daniel Dougherty Great Thank you guys Appreciate the time Daniel Dougherty Thanks Chris Thank you Operator Our next question comes from Alex Lau with JPMorgan Daniel Dougherty Sinclair Hi good morning Tony Alex Daniel Dougherty Good morning Those I wanted to start off with deposits which deposit verticals drove the increase in non interest bearing deposits on a period end basis and what are your expectations for DDA growth outside of the BDC runoff in 2024 Daniel Dougherty And so the increase in EBITDA was driven through GTAGPG clients and we 've got a purely a modest assumption in our model that we 'll see and you know fairly limited DDA growth going forward I think A. it 's becoming kind of kind of a unicorn out here It 's hard to find non interest bearing deposits at this juncture in the market But we do have a small assumption about a relatively small pump growth in our models Thank you and also for the thank you for the breakout of the 230 million in deposits from the new deposit initiatives Can you talk about the opportunities for these deposit verticals to increase their contribution to the funding base this year I think you 're going to continue to see stable increase I mean there are projections out there that some that are reasonably reasonably opposite opportunistic But I think what they 're going to continue to contribute and our goal is on as we said in the past we 've as we have been historically that off that our funding will be our loan growth will be funded specifically by core funding and they will continue to contribute on how much in any one quarter or year it 's hard to say but that 's our goal to continue to stay a core funded Yes thank you And then a question on deposit costs Given your higher payer on deposit costs how do you think about the beta moving downwards as the Fed cuts the funds rates and the timing given your deposit mix For example do you have the mix of index deposits that 's or how much is exception pricing Thanks Daniel Dougherty I mean our assumptions trend toward a very conservative 65 inclusive of the derivatives that we have in the balance sheet and take the derivatives off it gets closer to 75 I think we 're pretty hopeful that in fact it will be higher than that as short rates move down Thanks and then on I can follow up on expenses You mentioned the 10 to 12 growth on core noninterest expense Daniel Dougherty What is the normalized and space you are referring to for 2023 I believe I quoted that as Q4 annualized and then grossed up with the U.S. 10 to 12 And were there any project expenses in 2023 already and on the project expenses as well is there a sense of timing will be more front loaded or pretty spread out throughout the year Daniel Dougherty There were some modest expenses in 23 2024 is going to be placed lumpy I it 's very difficult to say they will be spread out through the year but it 's going to be quite lumpy as these as these sub projects if you will it could become online Okay And then just another follow up on the B to C fee income a loss over 24 Was that 5 to 6 million in exit run rate for 4Q 24 Is that the full year impact versus consensus for full year 24 five to $ 6 million for the full year Daniel Dougherty Remember the when you look at the 2020 23 results you 've got to back out the crypto from there that 's obviously not going to be recurring And then the adjustment as we just mentioned over the course of the year will be approximately five to 6 million And of course as Mark touched on this is really important Our our B2B pipeline is strong We have a strong commitment to growing that book of business and we remain quite of hopeful that that will continue to grow and it provides low cost it 's got a significant amount of low cost funding Great Thanks for taking my questions Right Daniel Dougherty Thank you Operator And we do have a follow up question from Chris O'Connell with KBW Yes just wanted to confirm the expense guide if I had it at the Q4 annualized sort of $ 37 million annualized a plus 6 to 8 and then the 2023 normalized OpEx plus the 10 to 12 Is that correct?Not the Q4 9 call Daniel Dougherty It 's overall overall is the the comp benefit 68 of Q4 That 's kind of U.S. specific both the but overall 10 to 12 off fourth quarter annualize Thank you Daniel Dougherty You 're welcome Operator Thank you This does conclude the allotted time we have for questions I will now turn the call back to Mark DeFazio for any additional or closing remarks I do n't have any closing remarks other than thank you all for attending and your continued support in to MCV Daniel Dougherty Thanks everybody Operator Thank you

McCormick Chairman President CEO Please go ahead Morning everyone and thank you for joining the call As the host said I 'm Rob McCormick President of TrustCo Bank I am joined today as usual with Scot Salvador and Mike Ozimek Scot will provide color on lending and credit quality and Mike will follow on my comments with detail on the numbers In 2023 we crossed an important milestone Our loan portfolio surpassed $ 5 billion During the year we grew residential loans over $ 192 million and grew our commercial portfolio by over $ 50 million We are very happy to report that our loan growth was accomplished without borrowing or broker time deposits While many see merit in these devices we think the better practice is funding loan growth from our deposits That 's the trustful way On the subject of deposits it is noteworthy that our team managed a difficult year very well Because they had already done the hard work of establishing customer relationships our bankers were able to grow our total deposits While wome funds shifted from core to time the important thing is we kept the customer retained the deposits and created the opportunity for funds to flow back into core Of course the resulting increase in cost of funds affected our margin The effect was less than it would have been had we borrowed or purchased deposits In other words in classic TrustCo fashion our team turned a potential negative into a positive Also in 2023 we cleaned up some things that could have hampered us in the future Like many banks across the country we were faced with litigation involving overdraft fees We chose to resolve these matters in the best way that in the way that best benefits our customers and shareholders Although final court approval is pending we consider it all resolved and that matter behind us We also took a hard look at our branch network and made the decision to close three locations that did not meet our expectations We are leaner and more efficient coming into 2024 Also worthy of comment is the fact that our credit quality remains extraordinary Nonperforming assets to total assets were 0.29 at year end That is the lowest this metric has been in over 17 years Again quite an accomplishment by our team in a challenging environment Finally as noted in the press release all of this good work springs from our rock solid capital position We took advantage of investment opportunities that were in line with our strategy preserving capital and maintaining maximum flexibility Because of this we had cash on hand to fund our loan growth and did not need to chase higher priced deposits No one knows exactly where rates will go or what other factors might come up this year but we are confident in our position and ready to capitalize on opportunities that arise Now Mike will give us detail on the numbers Scot will cover lending and then we 'll take your questions Mike Thank you Rob and good morning everyone I will now review TrustCo 's financial results for the fourth quarter of 2023.As we noted in the press release the company saw a year to date net income of $ 58.6 million which yielded a return on average assets and average equity of 0.97 and 9.46 respectively Capital remained strong Consolidated equity assets ratio was 10.46 for the fourth quarter of 23 compared tos 10 for the fourth quarter of 2022 Book value per share at December 31 23 was $ 33.92 up 7.5 compared to $ 31.54 a year earlier Average loans for the fourth quarter of 23 grew 6.6 or $ 309.9 million to $ 5 billion from the fourth quarter of 2022 an all time high Consequently loan growth has continued to increase and it occurred in all of our loan categories And leading the charge was the residential real estate portfolio as always which increased by $ 192.2 million or 4.26 in the fourth quarter of 2023 over the same period in 2022 Average commercial loan was increased $ 50.5 million or 22.6 Home equity lines of credit increased $ 61.8 million or 22.2 and installment loans increased $ 5.5 million or 50.3 over the same period in 2023.For the fourth quarter of 2023 the provision for credit losses was $ 1.35 million The additional provision in this quarter is reflection on the current economic environment and not an indication of existing credit issues at the bank Retaining deposits has been a key focus for 23 Although core deposits were down compared to prior year total deposits as of December 31 23 increased to $ 158 million to $ 5.35 billion from the end of 22 As we move forward our objective is to continue to offer competitive product offerings of the bank through aggressive marketing and product differentiation As we have mentioned we understood the big inflows of deposits during the pandemic were temporary and that is why we did not invest that liquidity into securities or loans or retain that liquidity on balance sheet for when the depositors are going to absorb those funds This gave us the flexibility to strategically price core deposits while retaining core customers Net interest income was $ 38.6 million for the fourth quarter of 23 a decrease of $ 10.6 million or 21.5 compared to the same period in 22 Net interest margin for the fourth quarter of 2023 was 2.6 compared to the fourth quarter of 22 Yield on interest earnings and assets increased to 3.93 up 39 basis points from 3.54 in the fourth quarter of 2022 And the cost of interest bearing to liabilities increased to 1.72 in the fourth quarter of 23 from the fourth quarter of 2022.We continue to be optimistic as we enter 2024 The majority of our CD portfolio has a three- to nine month maturity and will give us the opportunity to reprice these CDs in the near term as rates potentially fall Our wealth management division continues to be a significant recurring source of noninterest income They had approximately $ 967 million of assets under management as of December 31 2023.Now onto noninterest expense Total noninterest expense net of order expense came in at $ 28.8 million up $ 1.5 million from the prior quarter As mentioned in the earnings release this increase is primarily the result of nonrecurring expenses for a litigation settlement and also for branch closures This was offset by decreases in various other categories of expenses ORE expense net came in at an income of $ 12000 for the quarter as compared to the expense of $ 163000 in the prior quarter Given the continued low level of ORE expenses we 're going to continue to hold the anticipated level of expense not to exceed $ 250000 per quarter All the other categories of noninterest expense were in line with our expectations for the fourth quarter we would expect 24 's total recurring noninterest expense net of ORE expense to remain in the range of $ 26.9 million to $ 27.4 million We are optimistic of expenses in 2024.Now Scot will review the loan portfolio and nonperforming loans Good morning everyone Thanks Mike Total loans for the fourth quarter increased by $ 43 million in actual numbers or 0.9 Year over year the increase was $ 270 million or 5.7 Residential loans again led the increases with a total of $ 37 million in quarterly growth This was split between $ 22 million in first mortgages and $ 15 million in the home equity products The full year showed similar trends with $ 160 million of first mortgage growth and $ 62 million in home equities Commercial loans continue to grow increasing by $ 5 million on the quarter and by $ 43 million year over year Overall residential activity and market trends remained similar to those discussed in the most recent quarters We continue to post solid net growth in our first mortgage product although overall purchase activity is reflected of nationwide trends and is slower than in prior year The mid winter holiday period is of course also a slower time of the year although we expect activity to pick up as we begin to enter the early stages of the new season The recent decrease in interest rates although modest is also a positive factor which should help overall activity The home equity products continue to perform well overall with a good amount of activity and net growth The loan backlog is down from quarter end which is normal for this time of year and also down year over year This should begin to build as we progress forward and overall activity increases Interest rates have come down somewhat as mentioned and we currently stand at 6.38 for our base 30 year fixed rate We always have a variety of promotions and product enhancements we are working on We expect to utilize our status as primarily a portfolio lender to help spur activity and increase growth Asset quality remains strong overall Nonperforming assets totaled $ 17.9 million as of 12/31 This is down from $ 19.1 million in September and $ 19.6 million a year ago Nonperforming loans have remained relatively flat at $ 17.7 million down approximately $ 200000 from last quarter and up about the same amount from a year ago This total equates to 0.35 of nonperforming loans to total loans down slightly from 0.37 in the prior year Net charge offs for the quarter totaled $ 248000 For the full year the charge offs equated to a net recovery of $ 46000 The loan loss allowance now stands at 0.97 of total loans as of year end And finally the coverage ratio or allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was 275 in December compared to 263 a year ago Rob That 's our story and we 're happy to answer any questions any of you might have Operator Thank you Operator Instructions Alex Twerdahl Piper Sandler I was just first hoping that maybe you could just help us get a sense for how the NIM might react to some Fed rate cuts I think the first one is now modeled in for for May according to the forward curve And as you think about the CDs that Mike you alluded to repricing relatively quickly versus some of the assets that are more tied to the short end of the curve how should we expect the NIM to react to the first couple cuts if and when we get them We 've already started back in CD rates now from their high Alex and most people are going very short with regard to CDs So we 're optimistic with regard to repricing those to current market conditions at a lower rate later in the year It 's interesting if you offer just a 4.9 CD for three months or a 4.75 for six to nine months everybody takes the 4.90 So it 's interesting to watch how the consumer is reacting to that And I do hope we are optimistic with regard to repricing deposits through the balance of the year Okay So I mean I take from your tone that you 'd expect that pace of repricing of the deposits the rate which accelerated a little bit in the fourth quarter that that should abate in the first quarter Is that reasonable expectation That would be the hope Okay And then when I look at the ACL it went up about two basis points during the quarter and I think you alluded it to just some changes in macro forecasts What specifically I guess is it one geography versus the other or I guess what specifically has been driving that ACL And is that something that I guess should creep higher a little bit as maybe a little bit more uncertainty develops in 2024 That certainly could creep higher if uncertainty continues I can tell you that it is and you can see the nonperforming numbers I mean they really are flat so that 's not what 's driving the calculation It is however some of the macro numbers as you alluded to on some of the unemployment forecasts some of the housing numbers that type of thing That 's what drove it a little bit in the fourth quarter So to the extent that that gets worse we could see a little more But I think that was a healthy provision for the fourth quarter and I do n't see us trending well above 1 I think so I 'm comfortable where we are now We 've been in a net recovery position for a very long period of time now so At some point you have to inaudible Correct That 's correct Yeah I guess just back to the deposit strategy you guys have always kept a pretty healthy level of cash on the balance sheet and that looks like it grew into the end of the year As I think about that just relative to the amount of capital you have it seems like you have so much capital that gives you a lot of flexibility to create liquidity if needed I guess do you need to carry such a high level of cash or is that something that maybe can run down and give you a little bit more just a little bit more flexibility with deposit pricing and maybe a little bit more aggressiveness in lowering your deposit costs as maybe we 're now at a peak in rates I mean you you know as much or more about that than we do Liquidity certainly keeps the wolves off the door and gives you great flexibility to do what you have to with regard to deposit pricing so I would n't want to see a crazy increase in cash levels But where we 're at right now is not a bad position for the economic conditions and some of the things we 're facing in the industry Okay And then just final question for me just on expenses You guys talked about closing three branches and making some tough decisions Obviously it 's a challenging revenue environment so that makes a lot of sense Are there more initiatives underway I mean I know you gave the guidance for the year but are there more things you 're looking at if the revenue environment remains challenged to be able to trim expenses Yeah there are a number of relocations that are pending right now in our branch network not necessarily closures And every branch that comes up for maturity is evaluated and all options are open at that point in time An analysis is done on profitability and influence on the company and everything else And a decision and a risk assessment is made and then the decision is made whether we should continue with that lease or not And we have two or three pending relocations right now that we think are great opportunities for our company Just like we did with Wilton last year if you 're I do n't know how closely you track us but we moved our Wilton branch up the road next to a very popular convenience store and it has been a great move for us out of a former enclosed mall So those types of things are opportunities for us And we 're very happy to take advantage of them We have further consolidation you 'll see in our Rotterdam locations We 're closing a branch there and selling that so we 'll see more coming Okay that 's helpful And actually one more question if I could just on on capital you guys have a pretty healthy level of TCE stocks still trading below tangible book value Is buyback something that you would put back on the table in the near term Yeah We like the idea of the buyback We have an approved program Alex and we 've been active in the past with regard to buybacks And we like that idea especially with regard to book value Okay Appreciate taking my questions Operator Ian Lapey Gabelli Funds Congrats on a solid year in a tough environment A few questions First you talked last quarter about a split the difference loan product Can you give an update on how that 's going It was not very well received Ian and we walked away from that I was actually shocked how poorly received it was I do have to say if you had talked to our mortgage originators they would say it did introduce us to questions and comments on a lot of real estate transactions but we did n't get a lot of people to bite on it Okay Yeah it seemed like a sensible thing but okay I thought so too Next on credit obviously terrific $ 46000 in net recovery What do you expect though over the next couple of years for charge offs I mean I assume that it ca n't stay this good But when you 're underwriting particularly with higher rates now what would be a good expectation for charge offs You 've been with us for several years We 're a pretty conservative company and I certainly agree economic conditions and some of the changes could drive a little bit more with regard to charge off but we do n't see them skyrocketing Our backlog and our shorter term delinquencies are not climbing We have a very good handle on our collections and we just do n't see them skyrocketing over the near term or really even increasing markedly over the near term So I think we 're pretty comfortable with where we 're at As far as the net recovery we 've been in a net recovery position for so long now I do n't know how long that can continue but we do n't see that turning dramatically to a significant loss Okay Great And then lastly so you 've got about $ 238 million in residential mortgage backed securities And I know this is most other banks have much more proportionally But why for you would you buy any of these given that the core business is to hold fixed rate mortgages Maybe that 's multiple speakers Why buy excuse me Generally we agree with what you 're saying but we see good opportunities in the mortgage backs and that 's when we jumped in and out of them Sometimes along your line of thinking the agencies work pretty well for us But there have been opportunities to grab some rate on mortgage backs and have jumped in But I mean the bank 's portfolio is really a big mortgage backed security So generally speaking we agree with you Right So why not then because I 've been struggling with all banks owning this security given short term funding So for you you 've it looks like yours are yielding about 2.3 Why would n't you sell those and get a tax refund and then you could reinvest in either keep it in cash or one- or two year treasuries earning double and then position yourself as you said in the release There could be a number of different interest rate environments we do n't really know but it seems like that would protect you from a risk management standpoint as well That certainly gets tempting with the way the rate situation is right now and we do evaluate that pretty regularly We 've looked at that portfolio a number of times and what the tolerance is for that loss But overall we 're pretty comfortable with where we 're at but any opportunity we have to do something like that we would try and take advantage of You want to add any color into that Mike I agree with you We definitely looked at it I mean when we looked at it in the past the loss that that would generate when we bought higher securities if you were to go out and buy higher securities it was just longer than what I guess our tolerance was and our payback window we thought was appropriate so But we definitely looked at that We 've looked at that in the past Certainly others have done that Ian Okay great Yeah No I just I 've been surprised with how much and like I said you 've done much better than the vast majority of others but it just seems like a strange investment for a bank to make Anyway Okay well great And again Congrats on a good year Operator Greg Roeder Adirondack Funds Hey just a question on time deposits Time deposits in the quarter were up like 16 sequentially Total deposits were up for the first time meaningfully So I 'm curious is you saying that it 's a move from core to time and I get that But it was probably a little bit more than I 'm just curious if you could provide some more colors to new accounts bigger accounts Did you go out longer on the term Well we 're very much relationship driven Greg So a lot of the time deposit accounts come with the requirement for core And I said in my part of the presentation that we work with our existing customers and work those relationships as much as we possibly can and work our customer base and our portfolios to see who has what product and try and cross sell additional products to those customers So I think certainly core has risen as a function of the time deposits coming in And I would say that it 's as much a shift as it is new time deposits There was desperation The rates had been so low for so long there had been a lot of desperation in the population for higher rates so that you saw a lot of people take the jump into time at that point in time But I think our relationships are generally strong So when perhaps So perhaps when the 10 years started moving back down people made the jump and and tried to lock in Is that fair I would agree with that I would say I think we were slower to move than most and I think that speaks to our customer base and the strength of our customer base And I do think we were slower to move but when the rates did start to drop and you saw significant change I think people looked at opportunity Great Well thank you very much and good year Operator We have no further questions so I 'll hand the call back to Robert for closing comments Thank you for your interest in our company and have a great day Operator Thank you everyone for joining us today This concludes our call and you may now disconnect your lines\", 'link':

economic divide Before this assignment I could n't imagine the level of opulence and wealth we 'd find I 'd never seen floors made of wood from a 16th Century monastery or wallpaper made of Italian

NEWSWIRE Counslr the text based mental health support platform announced today that it is launching a pilot with Long Island 's Half Hollow Hills Central School District HHH As of the start of 2024 the student body at both HHH high schools will have full access to the Counslr platform and will be able to hold unlimited sessions with Counslr 's live licensed and vetted mental health support professionals This partnership addresses the ever growing need around the country for more accessible mental health resources for high school students As it so happens the founders of the app are HHH alumni having both graduated from its High School East We are pleased to be able to work with our alma mater and a community that gave us such strong foundations for becoming the people we are today said Josh Liss CEO of Counslr and a member of the Class of 2013 We are proud to be helping HHH address the growing need for mental health resources and ultimately be part of the solution Our data shows that most students 83 who begin using Counslr had never previously engaged with school mental health resources This is a highly indicative datapoint and thus we look forward to helping Half Hollow Hills reach these under addressed students Tyler Fisher and Josh Liss were great students in high school I had no idea what path in life each would take but I am glad their pursuits led them back to HHH said Dr. Jeffery Woodberry Assistant Superintendent for Districtwide Administration in Half Hollow Hills As their former principal I am proud to have played a small role in their development and I am excited to partner with them in this endeavor to provide mental health resources for our students It is crucial to support mental wellness in young people and we are pleased to provide Counslr as another avenue Liss met Counslr COO Tyler Fisher also from the Class of 2013 nearly two decades ago at Half Hollow Hills West Hollow Middle School Liss and Fisher joined forces in 2019 to help create Counslr and provide mental health support in a way that is convenient affordable and effectively reaches the traditionally unreachable The duo designed the app deliberately intending to destigmatize mental health support and help bridge various gaps within the care continuum By establishing organizational partnerships cost and insurance burdens are removed from the end user as are many logistical hurdles By providing 24/7/365 unlimited access to Counslr 's quasi anonymous services and making sessions available on demand or by appointment care barriers related to inconvenience and stigma are also eliminated Academic pressures omnipresent social media and concerning world events all contribute to heightened stress levels and mental health challenges among adolescents while provider shortages continue to impact an already strained mental health support system The need for a platform like Counslr has already been there for years and that need has only risen since the start of the pandemic Fisher said We are thrilled to help meet the demand at high schools and colleges across the country but it 's a particular honor to be working with our own school district We want to empower all students to take preventative steps and better prioritize their mental well being and it 's extremely satisfying to know that many of those students are now friends families and other members of the community where we grew up For more information on Counslr please visit www.counslr.com ABOUT HALF HOLLOW HILLS An education oriented community with high academic

New York City Mayor Eric Adams is classifying social media as a public health hazard and an environmental toxin saying young people must be protected from harm online Today Dr. Ashwin Vasan is issuing a Health Commissioner 's Advisory officially designating social media as a public health hazard in New York City Adams announced during his State of the City address Wednesday An advisory from the city said mental health for young New Yorkers has been declining for over a decade The advisory said that data from 2021 showed that on weekdays 77 of New York City high schoolers spent three or more hours per day in front of screens not including homework Adams claimed TikTok YouTube and Facebook are fueling a mental health crisis by designing their platforms with addictive and dangerous features We are the first major American city to take this step and call out the danger of social media like this the mayor said Just as the surgeon general did with tobacco and guns we are treating social media like other public health hazards and ensuring that tech companies take responsibility for their products In May 2023 Surgeon General Vivek Murthy issued an advisory warning that excessive social media use could be a profound risk to youth mental health The advisory recognized that social media has both positive and negative effects on young people According to Pew Research 59 of adolescents reported that social media helps them feel more accepted But the advisory said ultimately there was n't enough research and clear data to determine if social media is safe for adolescents to use Mayor

Ribeiro NY Daily News Tribune News Service via Getty Images I issued my advisory on social media and youth mental health because the most common question parents ask me is if social media is safe for their kids While some kids experience benefits from social media there is not enough evidence to conclude that social media is sufficiently safe Murthy told last year Instead there is more evidence that many kids are harmed by their use of social media Our children have become unknowing participants in a decades long experiment Murthy said last year And while there is more we have to learn about the full impact of social media use on their health and well being we know enough now to take action and protect our kids In a response issued at the time of the advisory from Murthy a representative for Meta the parent company of Facebook and Instagram referred to mental health as a complex issue and pointed toward other contributing factors such as limited access to health care the COVID-19 pandemic and academic pressure Representatives for YouTube told at the time that they have implemented a variety of safeguards for young users including adding digital wellbeing features removing content that endangers the emotional wellbeing of minors or promotes suicide and self harm and exploring ways to further collaborate with researchers A TikTok spokesperson told that its companies have added user aids to improve youth mental health such as bedtime reminders and age restrictions The company also said that it built an application programming interface that includes public data on content and accounts on the platform which is available to U.S. researchers Ivan Pereira Shannon Caturano and Peter Charalambous contributed to this report\", 'link': 'https://abcnews.go.com/US/new-york-city-mayor-eric-adams-declares-social/story?id=106647634', 'author': 'Abc News', 'published_date': '2024-01-24', 'image_link': 'https://i.abcnewsfe.com/a/f2819b13-2357-4173-a682-d5845bf4113b/eric-adams-gty-jef-240124_1706125122619_hpMain_16x9.jpg?w=1600'}, {'id': '8ddbfcaf38c39ee714ed24008f926e26', 'rank': 126, 'location': 'New York, NY', 'title': 'Lawrence Tynes Giants should give Dave Merritt consideration for DC', 'excerpt': 'Lawrence Tynes believes the New York Giants should give Dave Merritt a look for their vacant defensive coordinator position', 'summary': \"Former New York Giants kicker and two time Super Bowl champion Lawrence Tynes is lobbying for the Giants to hire a former assistant to become the team 's next defensive coordinator The Giants need to reach out to Dave Merritt for DC position What he has done with the Chiefs secondary and developing young talent is remarkable Dave and Spags have been together for many years between NY and KC and Dave was with us in NY on both Super Bowl teams pic.twitter.com/fjvJN1Mg3P Lawrence Tynes @lt4kicks January 24 2024 Dave Merritt served as a Giants defensive assistant from 2004 through 2017 in various roles the last one as the secondary and safeties coach Merritt left the Giants in 2018 and spent one year on the staff of the Arizona Cardinals before rejoining Steve Spagnuolo in Kansas City in 2019 where he has run the Chiefs defensive backs for the past four seasons Merritt has earned four Super Bowl rings in his career two with the Giants and two with Kansas City He is not currently being considered for any of the open NFL coaching vacancies as far as we can find so the Giants could have a clear path if they choose to hire him\", 'link': 'https://giantswire.usatoday.com/2024/01/24/lawrence-tynes-new-york-giants-should-give-dave-merritt-consideration-defensive-coordinator/', 'author': 'John Fennelly', 'published_date': '2024-01-24', 'image_link': 'https://giantswire.usatoday.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/67/2020/01/usatsi_4782714.jpg?w=1024&h=576&crop=1'}, {'id': '8d02fc925032c285b5b024a2c2c4ab7a', 'rank': 126, 'location': 'New York, NY', 'title': '7 Taylor Swift signs from Bills fans that completely backfired after Chiefs loss', 'excerpt': 'These Taylor Swift signs backfired in Buffalo', 'summary': \"We 've seen some pretty fantastic Taylor Swift themed signs throughout the year when she 's attended Travis Kelce 's Kansas City Chiefs games But on Sunday she had to watch Kelce in enemy territory with passionate fans in what 's known as the Bills Mafia aiming their sights at her with some of those signs we saw in the crowd A few were friendly but they were mainly Swift jokes and as we saw on Sunday it all backfired as the Bills lost to the Chiefs in a heartbreaking game Here 's a look at the signs photographed on Sunday that were everywhere in the crowd A Buffalo Bills fan holds up a sign before an NFL AFC division playoff football game against the Kansas City Chiefs Sunday Jan. 21 2024 in Orchard Park N.Y.

Paris Iceland Jamaica Costa Rica Cleveland Arizona Black Canyon of the Gunnison Banff Tokyo Ireland Hatch New Mexico New York City Mexico City Puerto Rico Hawaii Big Island Glenwood Springs Asheville North Carolina the Mountain Plover Festival Amache Camp Hall Mount Blue Sky and Boulder', 'summary': \"Every year The New York Times publishes a list titled 52 Places to Go and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming But most of those far flung locales are bucket listers the kinds of destinations that make for a once in a lifetime trip or a special adventure So we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024 but with more manageable goals and with a nod toward Colorado connections We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport because travel is already difficult these days prices crowds cancellations Why make it any harder Here are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year broken down into destinations in Colorado elsewhere in the United States and other countries or overseas Bon voyage IN COLORADO This year marks the 25th anniversary of Colorado 's fourth and least visited member of the nation 's most prestigious open space club Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways from scenic drives and rim side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes Montrose about five hours from Denver is a popular kickoff point Camp Hale Continental Divide National Monument Designating the 84500 acres where Colorado 's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 did n't change it much The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing snowmobiling and ATV riding But it 's gorgeous country and worth a stay at the campground Want to learn more about it There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind Boulder Boulder does n't really need the attention but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado But the city is more than football and cliches In fact in November Fodor 's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 only one other U.S. destination was included The travel guide honed in on Boulder 's scenery open space and accessibility to recreation and nature as well as the Pearl Street Mall 's dining options We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries as well as a Michelin starred restaurant Frasca Craft beer highway The origins of Colorado 's craft beer culture date back to 1979 when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene about 10 minutes west of U.S. 287 in Longmont There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287 between Broomfield and Fort Collins In fact you could call this 50 mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway Wanna get a taste Find a designated driver and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures some of which like Liquid Mechanics Cellar West Verboten and Zwei are among the best small breweries in the state Mount Blue Sky It 's not the tallest mountain in Colorado but it 's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best known peaks in the state And last September Mount Evans at 14130 feet was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups With the change it 's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of although not in winter The views up there are gorgeous and there is a good chance you 'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way Glenwood Springs There 's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak 's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon but also the less often seen backside of Denver and its suburbs Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years with big changes already completed or still on their way to some of its hot springs like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs among others The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite a stroll some entertainment and a beer perhaps from Casey Brewing Blending 's lively taproom Amache National Historic Site Wanna get away You do n't need Southwest Airlines Just drive east from the Front Range at any time of year really in the opposite direction of where most people are headed One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site which became part of the National Park System in 2022 Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II Today there is a cemetery a monument and landscaping to explore and to remember Mountain Plover Festival Karval Speaking of eastern Colorado one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April it 's April 26 28 this year in Karval What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different There are no motels or restaurants in Karval so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families meals and entertainment are provided So in addition to bird watching tours mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see you learn about the history and community of the area Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County IN THE UNITED STATES Spring training in Arizona No matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball 's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix Tempe Scottsdale area can be a magical experience And as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale it 's also a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s a nice break from cold Colorado weather and there are pools aplenty Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument Arizona Grand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system with nearly 5 million visitors per year but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites The national monument is n't that easy to visit since it consists mostly of open space but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest Hatch N.M. The great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch N.M. an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles Other things to see in the area White Sands Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie and Oscar nominee Oppenheimer Make sure to stop in Pueblo Colo. on your way back up Interstate 25 though that 's the heart of Colorado 's own green chile country so you can settle the debate for yourself Asheville N.C. DIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville N.C. in September and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver 's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months Fort Collins founded New Belgium also has a taproom there But Asheville set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway should be on any Coloradan 's list anyway because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene it 's an outdoor lovers mountain playground New York City There 's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium the date is still TBA the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism Feb. 25 June 28 Plus you can get your fill of ramen pizza bagels and dumplings which is always a reason for joy Cleveland Ah the Land A city on the comeback Cleveland is a shortish trip by air and in 2024 it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse or the path of totality which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8 Why Cleveland Well there is a small and lesser known national park just 30 minutes away called Cuyahoga Valley which will be celebrating the eclipse with ranger led activities And while you 're in the vicinity take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day The mountains here are stunning certainly but let 's face it Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii 's major islands but and Hapuna Beach might be the most beautiful of them all Expansive warm and a great place to snorkel Hapuna is truly mesmerizing But do n't stop there In addition to Hawaiʻi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines the Big Island also boasts white sand green sand and black sand beaches Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa a visit here is the cure to cabin fever OVERSEAS Paris Maybe it does n't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest busiest most congested time of the year Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need Either way there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26 Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years and if the Olympics are n't your thing then consider this Notre Dame Cathedral which nearly burned down in 2019 is set to reopen in December 2024 Dublin For being the sixth busiest airport in the entire world DIA does n't have many direct nonstop international flights So it 's worth celebrating each and every new one In May Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin Ireland 's lively capital city The historic sites here go back more than 1000 years and you can and should tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside including the Cliffs of Moher Giant 's Causeway and Killarney National Park Iceland Also on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland with its waterfalls blue lagoons and adorable puffins The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland Tokyo Japan 's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver and it 's worth the trip The city is like no other place in the world and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood It 's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining recreation or just people watching There 's also craft beer whiskey manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers Jamaica Last February Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay Jamaica cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day with a stopover as we wrote in a travel guide to the country 's tourist capital So for laid back beach bars sizzling jerk chicken swimming holes and of course music this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean Puerto Rico Not to be outdone United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan Puerto Rico in October slashing travel time to the island by several hours Even better you do n't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters plantains and tropical rum drinks however Read more about this sunny destination along with its beaches rainforests history and culture in our recent travel guide Mexico City Mexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade with several neighborhoods teeming with art culture and cuisine Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas churros or cute coffee shops catching the spectacle of lucha libre visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia and trying chapuline with your mezcal Oh and at 7200 feet in altitude it 's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver so you should feel right at home Costa Rica The pura vida never goes out of style but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly

you to be out of there You have good relationships with your children Your friendships are active and intact I assume that if you approached almost anyone in your circle and asked if you could stay with them while you work on your own next steps they would be happy to offer you temporary housing and possibly be relieved for you If you do n't want to divorce your husband because of issues related to your faith practice or your combined finances then stay legally married and treat him with compassion by telling him I wish the best for you I invite you to the table but I will only live with you if you are willing to make some big changes for the sake of our family Before making any longer term moves it is vital that you receive professional legal and financial advice concerning your property your finances and future Dear Amy My ex husband and I have been divorced for five years We both have other partners We share custody with our two children and successfully co parent The only problem I have with him is when he insists on showing up at our kids soccer and softball games sometimes with his girlfriend on the days when I have custody In my opinion these days when I have custody are for me to share with my children and he should respect that What do you think Stressed Dear Stressed Let 's reframe this Your custodial days are not for you but for your children The focus should be on parenting them and making sure their needs are met to the best of your ability And so would n't it be best for your children to have multiple people cheering them on from the sidelines And would n't it be best for them to see their parents cordially getting along Your co parenting plan is not equivalent to having a restraining order You should both show up for school events if you are able It sounds as if you and your ex are mainly doing a good job regarding your kids Do n't blow it now | | Ask Amy Grandson 's clothing ca n't travel between homes Ask Amy Grandson 's clothing ca n't travel

wants school shooter son to testify in her defense', 'excerpt': 'By Brad Brooks', 'summary': \"28 By Brad Brooks Reuters -A Michigan woman facing manslaughter charges for a school shooting carried out by her son wants him to testify in her defense according to court documents filed Tuesday That came as jury selection began in the trial that legal experts say is unprecedented and that gun safety advocates hope prompts more parents to be held to account for their roles in school shootings Ethan Crumbley who was 15 at the time of the 2021 shooting at Oxford High School pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts including four of first degree murder and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole He carried out the shooting with a gun his parents bought him as a Christmas present In documents filed with the court in Pontiac Michigan Shannon Smith the defense attorney for Jennifer Crumbley 45 asked the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews to force Ethan Crumbley to testify in his mother 's trial Smith also asked the judge to order psychiatrists who have treated Ethan Crumbley to testify Attorneys from the State Appellate Defender Office who are representing Ethan Crumbley as he appeals his life sentence are fighting any order that would compel him or psychiatrists who have treated him to testify in the trial of his mother or father We will advise Ethan to invoke his right to remain silent Ethan Crumbley 's attorneys Jacqueline Ouvry and Alison Swain wrote in a Tuesday filing Jury selection began on Tuesday with lawyers working to seat 12 jurors and five alternates from a pool of at least 300 Jennifer Crumbley and her husband James Crumbley 47 are being tried separately after being charged with four manslaughter counts in late 2021 They have remained in jail since James Crumbley 's trial opens on March 5 When the charges were announced prosecutors said the Crumbleys failure to both secure the gun in their home and to respond to warnings that their son Ethan was violent and disturbed justified the charges they face Defense attorneys have said in court documents that the Crumbleys had no way of knowing their son was going to carry out the shooting Legal experts have said the parents trials break new legal ground Josh Horwitz co director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions said school shooter 's parents are often not held to account because of feelings that they 've been through enough or because of lax enforcement of such measures as safe storage laws Holding more parents responsible when appropriate is an important step Horwitz said given that studies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have shown that around 75 of all school shooters obtained their weapons in the home Rarely are high school shooters going out and buying guns from a gun store Horwitz said The broader lesson from this case is that every parent who is a gun owner has a role to play and that 's the secure and safe storage of firearms PREVENTABLE TRAGEDY Four days before the Nov. 30 2021 shooting Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop where James Crumbley bought a 9 mm handgun prosecutors said Ethan posted photos of the gun on social media writing Just got my new beauty today and adding a heart emoji The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range testing out his new Christmas present Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said when she announced charges against the parents The day before the shooting at the school about 25 miles 40 km north of Detroit a teacher found Ethan Crumbley using his smart phone to search for ammunition and alerted school officials The officials left messages for his mother that went unreturned His mother later texted him LOL I 'm not mad at you You have to learn not to get caught On the morning of the shooting a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun a bullet and a bleeding figure next to the words Blood everywhere My life is useless and The thoughts wo n't stop help me The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home prosecutors have said The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing prosecutors say This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter 's parents had n't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the shooter or if his parents had taken basic steps to securely store the gun said Nick Suplina senior vice president of Law and Policy at the anti gun violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun

opened Absolute Vinyl Records Stereo in a tiny spartan space in then quiet North Boulder in 2009 with the help of his wife Annie The shop made fast fans finding its niche by cleaning and grading every record it sells and boasting shelves full of vintage but near mint turntables speakers and receivers Doug and Annie were n't in that location for long The fire department came by to inspect that building every four or five months because it should have been condemned I could n't wait to get out of there Gaddy says It was part of a remnant of an entire world that existed in North Boulder when it was a home for the disaffected disadvantaged and disgruntled I was there in the last days of that Absolute Vinyl currently celebrating its 15th year in business was only in that original location for a little under two years before moving to a larger storefront on Arapahoe Avenue near 55th Street Gaddy would stay in that location attracting vinyl and stereo enthusiasts and creating a tight knit community that included several young employees attached to a short lived but vital local label called First Base Tapes until about a year before the COVID-19 pandemic That 's when he took a leap of faith and moved to Main Street in Longmont The rent is cheaper the foot traffic is better in downtown Longmont and a lot of people are moving there from more expensive areas of Boulder County Gaddy wo n't say whether he sees the new Absolute Vinyl as a big improvement he 'll just say it 's different Everything is different than everything else but Longmont 's really happy I 'm there and I 'm happy to be in Longmont he says Boulder is totally different than when I left I mean there 's no way to compare anything given the last five years of existence on earth it 's apples and moon rocks Everything 's been touched by the tumult of that period One thing 's for sure according to Gaddy He hears I just moved to Longmont all the time A lot of new blood is in the shop so to speak in terms of the customer base he says It 's folks out exploring because they 're excited to be in Longmont They find it an interesting place to live Giselle Collazo left and Brenda Gurung clean used LPs at Absolute Vinyl Image courtesy Doug Gaddy Like the old days of Albums on the Hill when owner Andy Schneidkraut was holding court on 13th Street a large part of Absolute Vinyl 's attraction is the chance to talk records and audio equipment with Gaddy He has been selling albums in some form or another initially focusing on record shows since the late 1980s As the story goes Gaddy had the geekdom necessary to curate and his wife had an impressive ability to make all the other geeks comfortable socially Since Absolute Vinyl cleans and grades every single used record his shop puts on sale the result is never wondering the exact condition an LP might be in when you put it on your turntable at home Gaddy says he knows the ache of heartbreak from discovering after you 've bought a used record that it 's not in as good condition as you thought so he wanted to avoid his customers suffering the same surprise He remembers selling records on eBay in the late 1990s and early 2000s and needing them to be in pristine condition to avoid bad reviews from fussy European and Asian buyers He says that contributed to his obsession with cleaning and grading I do n't want to sound like I 'm tooting my own horn but I get people who come to the shop and say I only come to your shop because as record shoppers the condition of the record is really important he says I want people to know what they 're getting and I want what they believe they 're getting in the shop to hold true once they get home As a result no one really returns records Other shops offer a big selection of music related products from band T shirts to bobbleheads and lunchboxes but Gaddy focuses on records and stereo equipment Although he 's changed locations a few times it has n't been for lack of business I proved my model at Absolute Vinyl 's original location he says It was popular I was in the black from the first month and I stepped into much bigger rent on Arapahoe swallowed hard got a much shinier brighter place By then things were sort of turning around for the economy and that was a great spot for eight and a half years Now more than a decade since opening his first location he and Annie have found a happy home for Absolute Vinyl Just do n't ask Gaddy to say he 's satisfied What the hell I might as well get existential I do n't know if I 've ever felt at home anywhere he says I 'm always

Uncrustables plant and Bimbo 's acquisition in late 2022 of St Pierre Group the baker of brioche style products Also cause for optimism were two major transactions completed over the past year aimed at accelerating growth the spinoff of Kellogg Co. into Kellanova and WK Kellogg Co and the Smucker acquisition of Hostess Brands Meanwhile food beverage and processing companies go into 2024 with far more attractive relative valuation than was the case in January 2023 Despite last year 's difficulties there is cause for optimism in the new year\", 'link': 'https://www.bakingbusiness.com/articles/60742-important-to-keep-tough-year-for-grain-based-shares-in-perspective', 'author': 'Josh Sosland', 'published_date': '2024-01-24', 'image_link': 'https://www.bakingbusiness.com/ext/resources/2020/6/StockMarket_Lead.jpg?height=635&t=1705383375&width=1200'}, {'id': 'e40670601bcbf5becceba11db7672bb9', 'rank': 73756, 'location': 'Longmont, CO', 'title': 'Gordon Gablenz 63 Clear Lake', 'excerpt': 'Gordon Gablenz age 63 of Clear Lake MN passed away on Friday January 19 2024 at M Health Fairview University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis', 'summary': \"July 30 1960 January 19 2024 Gordon Gablenz age 63 of Clear Lake MN passed away on Friday January 19 2024 at M Health Fairview University of Minnesota Medical Center in Minneapolis Gordon was born on July 30 1960 to William Bill and Phyllis Frost Gablenz in Little Falls MN Gordon graduated from Royalton High School in 1978 He earned a Bachelor of Science from North Dakota State University in 1983 with majors in Accounting Business Administration and Economics Gordon was employed at First Bank Con Agra Bankers Systems North Memorial Health and ING before joining Ridgeview Medical Center in Waconia MN in May 2001 Over his 22 years with Ridgeview he was Director of Accounting Finance CFO CIO and most recently Chief Investment Officer Treasurer Gordon was united in marriage to Jill Oredson on February 17 1990 in Bloomington MN The couple lived in Bloomington before making their home in St. Cloud where they raised their two sons Gordon and Jill found their dream lake home in 2014 north of Clear Lake Gordon enjoyed following the markets and investing in them He loved college football and was a passionate NDSU Bisons fan He also enjoyed boating on the lake and traveling with his wife especially to Key West FL and the Canadian Rockies Known for his generosity patience integrity honesty and kindness Gordon served on the board of the Ridgeview Foundation and supported a variety of causes He was also a finalist for the Minneapolis St. Paul Business Journal 's CFO of the Year in 2011 Gordon is survived by his wife Jill of almost 34 years sons Neil Christopher Davis of Buffalo NY and Erik of Clear Lake brother Gary of Hudson WI and sister Kathy Ray Henderson of Longmont CO Also surviving are father in law Robert Oredson of Bloomington and sisters in law Leslie Phil Henry Oredson of Phoenix AZ and Paula Paulson of Becker MN and many cousins nieces and nephews He is preceded in death by his parents his sister in law Shawn Gablenz mother in law Jeannette Oredson and brother in law Wayne Paulson A Celebration of Life for Gordon will be held on Monday January 29 2024 at 11 AM at the Miller Carlin Funeral Home in St. Cloud Visitation will be held for one hour prior to the service at the funeral home on 3013 Roosevelt Road Memorials are preferred in lieu of flowers\", 'link': 'https://wjon.com/gordon-gablenz-63-clear-lake/', 'author': 'WJON StaffWJON StaffPublished:', 'published_date': '2024-01-23', 'image_link': 'https://townsquare.media/site/67/files/2019/07/ObitLily_Kokako.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89'}, {'id': '4c35e2620966459346b1433f5f182581', 'rank': 74744, 'location': 'Longmont, CO', 'title': 'Toro opens robotics research division in Frederick', 'excerpt': 'Lawn care company The Toro Co. has selected Frederick for a research and development center for its robotics division', 'summary': \"Lawn care company The Toro Co. has selected Frederick for a research and development center for its robotics division Gov.

glide across the ice and soar through the air One such figure skater Dacia Loconte has a whole day of learning ahead of her heading next to Mesa Ridge High School for class It 's actually been really fun just watching her love the sport the way she does and work as hard as she does just to learn the skills and stuff like that but more importantly for me is that she loves it said Beth Loconte Dacia 's mother At three years old Dacia knew she was destined to be laced up and in the rink I saw it on TV and said that 's what I want to do said Dacia With her mind set on skating she first began skating at seven years old and has n't stopped since Her journey has not been as smooth as the ice she skates on though At thirteen years old she was diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury that according to her mother came from birth It 's in my cerebellum and basically it 's like on the really mild spectrum of traumatic brain injuries Dacia said It just means my coordination skills are a little like below average because I do n't sequence that well Her condition would not stop her out on the ice This determined seventeen year old would not stop chasing her passion for competitive figure skating It 's really incredible because especially for her to try something like figure skating which is like one of the most detailed balancing coordinated sports ever and you know jumping in the air and rotating it 's like just what she 's been able to do is pretty outstanding said Ryan Jahnke one of Dacia 's assistant coaches While practice makes perfect it is not always easy when Dacia hits the ice She dedicates herself not only to improving coordination but also to understanding feedback to improve When I 'm tired it gets worse Dacia said So that 's something and then it affects auditory processing so sometimes I 'll hear things but it wo n't process in my brain So I do n't realize what someone said or like I do n't like to retain that information In April she will head to London to compete in the Inclusive Skating World Championships where she will have opportunity to meet individuals who are also competitive figure skaters It 'll be my first time going internationally at least to Europe or like to the east so that 's super exciting Loconte said I 'll finally actually be going to meet the others who are part of this track in person which is great To help cheer Dacia on and support her efforts to go to Inclusive Worlds a fundraising event will be held on Feb. 1 at Munchies719 Details on the event can be found here and there is also a GoFundMe page to help her on her journey While Dacia is focusing on the upcoming competition she is working alongside her mother to create awareness on the inclusive skating program in Europe We 're trying to promote awareness that people who have physical disabilities have a place to not only skate but also compete in figure skating Beth said Figure skating is not in the Paralympics yet and so part of what is happening with the program in Europe the inclusive skating program is that they 're putting together competitions so that eventually the competition to become part of the Paralympics If you would like to stay up to date on Dacia 's mission to inspire other skaters with physical disabilities you can follow her on her Instagram Deep in her heart lies the biggest motivator the one that first caught her eyes at three years old I just kept going I guess I just learned because it was something I really wanted to do for a while I really wanted to go to the Olympics and skate competitively so I kept going\",

experience but the transition can be overwhelming and stressful for both the dog and the new owner HSPPR said offering patience consistency and positive reinforcement during this time helps the new pet build trust and adjust to the new environnment According to HSPPR the key to a proper introduction is the 3 3 3 rule It takes the first three days for the animal to decompress from all the recent changes and allows them time and space to acclimate to the new environment The next three weeks is when your new pet begins to learn your routine and when you can begin to slowly introduce other pets and family members The next three months is when they begin to adjust to their new home and is a good period to begin training and develop good habits However every dog is different so remember to

vibrant paint Sold over Facebook Marketplace to Tiffany Thompson and Chris Estrada who envisioned turning this instrument into something more meaningful to help give back to chairty We found on Facebook Marketplace a retired military veteran that had this Taylor guitar because we wanted it to be a Taylor guitar because of Taylor Swift said Thompson Usually I get the cheaper kind of repurposed guitars that are not in good shape for about $ 50 to $ 100 This is not the first time Thompson used her talents to paint a guitar several years ago she was first tasked with channeling her creativity I do all kinds of other paintings I do murals and I 've always done art Thompson said But I was asked if I could paint a guitar for someone a couple of years ago and had never thought about it and so I did and that 's just kind of how it started Then I started getting asked mostly for charities if I would paint guitars for their auctions and to raise money for charity While the two are avid Kansas City Chiefs fans Estrada deserves recognition for bringing the idea to life with the instrument sharing the same name as the award winning performer We were looking around marketplace for different guitars and she 'd found several and then when I came up with the idea Hey why do n't you paint Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift guitar Estrada said I thought what better than to find a Taylor guitar to put it on After purchasing the Taylor guitar Thompson dove into action not only getting necessary paint and pens but also carefully planning the design on this unique canvas You had to get kind of creative with all the sound hole and the shape of it to kind of make it all fit Thompson said So I usually kind of sketch it out beforehand on a copy of a guitar so I can see how it 's going to fit Saturated in the spirit of Bejeweled along with multiple other Swift songs this guitar sparkles with added bling to elevate the masterpiece Then my favorite part is putting the finishing touches on it and like the bling and outlining it so that it really pops and it comes to life Thompson said But leading up to it like when you 're priming I always tell people do n't look at it until it 's done because I like the finished product when you get all the sparkles on it and the details Under these layers of paint there 's more meaning to this work with the ultimate goal to raise funds for a Hope House She would like to get the guitar signed by both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce with the profits going toward a good cause So in 2015 I ended up at the domestic violence shelter in Kansas City it 's Independence Missouri which is Kansas City area they helped me Thompson said So over the course of the next probably seven months I went to counseling they have a lot of resources so that I could start over because I basically just had to start over at age 47 Her own personal connection to the domestic violence shelter motivates her not only to keep chasing this autograph dream but also reveals the profound impact a donation could have on so many individuals You need to get a good night 's sleep you need food you need that help Thompson said You ca n't sometimes go to your family because you do n't want to draw your family into that you know time of your life and put them in danger So it 's really important for these shelters to get money for the women and children just to be able to have some place to go and be safe While proceeds from this guitar will go to the shelter in Kansas City that helped her Thompson is on a mission not to stop there and continue raising funds for other Hope Houses across the country In the process of working away on the guitar she has documented the every step on social media with the hope that these superstars will catch a glimpse of her artistic endeavor It 's just really cool seeing everybody comment on the videos and the news bits Estrada said I never expected it but you know I ca n't wait to see Taylor and Travis sign this thing because I know it 's going to happen You can follow her journey on Instagram @Guitaristtiffany or on Facebook @Guitartist While Thompson is chasing her wildest dreams she hopes to make the power duo aware of the specially crafted guitar especially since there 's a blank space waiting for their names I just really wanted to get it signed and however it happens would just be a blessing Thompson said But I just want to get it signed so that we can just hand that money over to Hope House and get some money raised\", 'link':

Thursday night heading into Friday storm system will be Anand said Something to keep an eye on Santa Fe is forecast over the next several days to get average highs of 43 and lows a bit below freezing which are slightly cooler than normal but balmy compared with the temperatures that did n't rise above freezing for much of January Tuesday might be damp but that 's more likely to be rain rather than snow south of Santa Fe Anand said A higher pressure system is forecast to move into the state from the south over the weekend warming temperatures to the seasonal average or a little above it he said Santa Fe 's temperatures could reach the 50s by early next week according to weather data The extended outlook for the next two weeks is warmer than average temperatures and precipitation across the Southwest again following the El Niño predictions Looking ahead into late February storms are expected to remain active throughout the country increasing the probabilities of precipitation across the desert Southwest Anand said Meanwhile El Niño a Pacific Ocean climate pattern that often causes wetter Southwest winters is fulfilling expectations by adding to snowpack in regional mountain ranges

the class about how he had hiked the Appalachian Trail and showed on a map how far he had walked This was the first recollection Humeston has of hearing about the Appalachian Trail Twenty five years later he would meet with Grey Fox before starting his own thru hike attempt of the Appalachian Trail Humeston said he was involved in Boy Scouts at a young age where his love for hiking camping and backpacking began He earned his Eagle Scout rank in 1997 Humeston studied finance and economics at Ohio University and graduated in 2003 He moved around the country working a variety of jobs and traveling internationally after college eventually settling in Seattle There he worked in the healthcare industry and was heavily involved with the local music scene He continued to foster his love of backpacking in the Pacific Northwest In fall 2012 he and his partner Amy Popp decided to relocate back to the Midwest to be closer to family During this transition period he prepared and planned his attempt at a thru hike of the Appalachian Trail for spring 2013 After successfully completing the Appalachian Trail he moved to Columbus and started a career with local startup CoverMyMeds as well as a part time job with outdoor retailer REI as they opened their Easton location In 2016 Humeston took a sabbatical from CoverMyMeds and REI to successfully thru hike the PCT In summer 2019 he was

two pairs on each of the other two treks as well On all three trips Merrell replaced the set of boots for free because I was thru hiking a very generous company he said He went alone on this latest trip but was familiar with most other thru hikers attempting the hike It 's a small group that starts to run across each other from time to time and begin to learn who is out there doing the same thing It 's a roving band of thru hikers that may not see each other that often but keep tabs on one another he said I pushed my pace harder than the pace I kept on the AT and the PCT to be able to do the Colorado sections I was most interested in Collegiates and San Juans Pushing was the right decision I barely got thru the San Juans The last couple days were brutal thundersnow storms and reports after me were that people were n't able to get thru he said A marmot stole his shirt at Scenic Point in Glacier National Park I had to chase him down the mountain shirtless to get it back A porcupine

Aubrey Wardman and is one of the last remaining rock structures in the city The house is located at 66 050 Third St. in Desert Hot Springs Lee and his wife Leonora lived in the home for many years In 1959 a Desert Sentinel newspaper article reported that Leonora planned to sell the Rock House after Lee 's death and move to Pasadena Over the years many of these vernacular architectural style rock homes have burned down or been destroyed Five years ago the Desert Hot Springs Historical Society purchased the Rock House and spent more than $ 200000 in donations to fix it up including $ 25000 from the city last April On Saturday community members and local officials gathered to celebrate the new resource in town and its history But the highlight of the day came after the main program ended For years Marjorie Snell an ex officio member of the historical society was searching for any living relatives of Lee and Leonora Watkins who had photographs pieces of furniture or any additional information about the house When Lori Bachelder Nelson whose great grandmother was Leonora walked in on Saturday with some of those items Snell with tears in her eyes hugged her tightly Bachelder Nelson explained that her brother came across a Desert Sun article on the Pil O Rox and their mother immediately identified her grandparents house The article was the Desert Sun 's weekly history column published on Jan. 14 penned by Tracy Conrad of the Palm Springs Historical Society When Bachelder Nelson saw there was an open house taking place she and her son in law got in the car with memorabilia in hand to drive to the historic house I have spent hours and hours and hours searching for family members Snell told Bachelder Nelson I hope you 're as thrilled as I am to know that this home is being preserved Bachelder Nelson who lives in Yucaipa has some recollection of the home but she is n't sure if she was physically in it before or if she remembers it through photographs Nevertheless it was important for her to come out to learn more about her family history and take part in an important day They spent the weekend before Christmas out here as a family tradition for years and years Bachelder Nelson said Along with photographs of the whole family in front of the home Bachelder Nelson also brought a small piece of cholla cactus wood that was once part of a side table Early pioneers in the area built their residential homestead shacks and sheds out of scraps of wood galvanized siding from abandoned train cars desert brush for insulation and rocks and stones for the structures according to the Desert Hot Springs Historical Society Watkins made all the furniture in the home out of cholla cactus wood None of the original furniture remains inside the home today and Bachelder Nelson said there 's likely none left as her own side table broke down after so many years The modest rock cottage features wooden doors and ceiling donated artwork from local artists thanks to the Spa City Paletteers Art Club historical books on the history of Desert Hot Springs old letters from Wardman and painted pots Outside there is a rock seating area rock arches and what looks like an old stone oven Many community members were not aware of the home prior to 2019 because the property was quite overgrown Additionally Snell said many rock houses were destroyed by fires and some that remained standing were torn down by the city for safety reasons As Snell looked at the home on Saturday she reflected on how hardworking Lee was to have built the home at 70 They were pioneers really and developed Desert Hot Springs Snell said Similarly Desert Hot Springs resident Sandra Chank was not familiar with the home years prior despite living a block away from it She called the home a cottage fantasy and very romantically designed and believes it is a great asset to the city It 's good for people to remember who founded this town and what kind of people founded it They were hard workers and to be subjected to living in a place with extreme heat and not a lot of water they were pioneers Chank said It feels cozy and loving I can see he had great love for his wife and everything he put into the house Fourth District Supervisor V. Manuel Perez was amazed by Lee Watkins strength determination and hard work Perez joked that he can barely put up his Christmas lights let alone build an entire house by hand Desert Hot Springs Historical Society President Robert Griffith said the home will likely open to the public in about a week or two but the group is in need of volunteer docents He said the space will at first be open on the weekends but he hopes to align its hours with those of Cabot 's Pueblo Museum another historic house that was built by early pioneer Cabot Yerxa Griffith also envisions a rotating schedule of historical and local artist exhibits at the museum and visitors center so that it can be a true community space The Historic Rock House also will channel its roots by being a venue for small community gatherings According to the historical society Lee and Leonora Watkins frequently hosted events at their home and the spot essentially became a social hub in the emerging desert city Griffith hopes to host art events or plant sales in the future Visit www.dhshistoricalsociety.org for more information on the Desert Hot Springs Historical Society how to become a volunteer and to keep up with events at the Historic Rock House Previous reporting from The Desert Sun 's Ani Gasparyan was used Ema Sasic covers entertainment and health in the Coachella Valley Reach her at ema.sasic@desertsun.com or on Twitter @ema_sasic This article originally appeared on Palm Springs Desert Sun Rock House in Desert Hot Springs reopens to public What to know\", 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/historic-rock-house-desert-hot-215825528.html', 'author': 'Ema Sasic', 'published_date': '2024-01-20', 'image_link': 'https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/8mhnv.znh1qslzqKF.oCMg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the-desert-sun/2a24dd7148b0855b02527b8be2f468d5'}, {'id': '07c304711476177bca008fa239c12d05', 'rank': 31, 'location': 'Colorado Springs, Colorado', 'title': \"Next stop on Trump 's path to be presumptive nominee The Supreme Court\", 'excerpt': 'Even as Trump rumbles to the nomination his eligibility to run for president still has not been settled', 'summary': \"Donald Trump 's convincing victory in the New Hampshire primary positions puts him on an easy path to the nomination right Trump still has a significant hurdle ahead of him and no amount of fundraising or voter outreach can eliminate it He needs to win a potentially decisive showdown at the Supreme Court On Feb. 8 the high court will hear oral arguments on whether Trump is an insurrectionist who is barred by the 14th Amendment from running for president Trump is appealing a Colorado decision that determined he was disqualified due to his actions before and during the Jan. 6 2021 attack on the Capitol If the court answers yes and assuming that answer applies to the primaries as well as the general election Trump ca n't become the Republican nominee no matter what the primary results dictate Most legal observers doubt that a majority of justices will declare Trump ineligible to run A far more likely result experts say is that the court will find an off ramp that will allow Trump to remain on the ballot based on a narrow or technical reading of the 14th Amendment 's insurrection clause But the fact that Trump 's eligibility remains in some legal doubt even as he seems poised to sew up the nomination at this early stage is another reminder of how Trump 's unprecedented legal woes are interlaced with his political fortunes I believe that the court will find a way to find that he is in fact eligible for the ballot said Jessica Levinson a constitutional law professor at Loyola Marymount University At the end of the day I ca n't escape the conclusion that the Supreme Court does n't want to be the body that took this choice away from the voters She added I think they still have PTSD from Bush v. Gore the case that decided the 2000 presidential election Of all of Trump 's legal troubles only the 14th Amendment challenge at the Supreme Court poses a direct threat to his bid to become president again Although he is also facing four criminal trials the timing or circumstances of each of them seem increasingly unlikely to derail his campaign Two of those cases consist of federal charges brought by special counsel Jack Smith one over Trump 's efforts to subvert the results of the 2020 election and the other regarding his mishandling of classified documents Both of those cases are scheduled to go to trial this spring but the dates are almost certain to get postponed possibly until after the November election Even if they do take place this spring or summer and Trump is convicted he can still run for president as a convicted felon or even from behind bars And if he becomes president he can seek to pardon himself in either federal matter That leaves his two other criminal cases both on the state level one in New York and one in Georgia The New York trial over Trump 's alleged falsification of business records connected to hush money payments made to silence affair allegations from porn star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential campaign is set to begin in late March Trump would n't be able to pardon himself in the state cases but he also probably would n't have to serve a prison sentence if convicted Though he is charged with 34 felony counts none of the counts carries a mandatory minimum sentence and legal experts say judges seldom sentence first time offenders to any prison time for the crime of felony falsification of business records The case while perhaps embarrassing for Trump does not appear to hold existential threat to his campaign at this juncture Trump 's fourth criminal case is in Georgia where he has been indicted on racketeering charges for his attempt to overturn the 2020 election by subverting Joe Biden 's victory in the state The Georgia trial is yet to be scheduled meaning it may not take place before the November election or possibly the inauguration And if he were to be convicted in Georgia and sentenced to prison in theory he could still be president said Levinson I do n't see anything in the Constitution that says you ca n't serve from a prison cell\", 'link':

City Councilman Steve Petterson passed away last month just three short days of Christmas at the age of 79 in his home at Glenwood Springs Colorado Too few locals are aware that Steve left a legacy of accomplishment and service in San Luis Obispo We both grew up in a small Bay Area town where Steve was my family 's paperboy We both went to the same high school in the early 1960s and ended up at Cal Poly later that decade Steve studied agricultural business where he began his lifelong interest in horses Indeed his life personified Ronald Reagan 's credo The outside of a horse is the best thing for the inside of a man But it was when both of us served on the San Luis Obispo City Council in the early 1970s along with such visionaries as Mayor Kenneth Schwartz and Councilmember Myron Graham that we got to know each other better While I was a liberal and Steve a conservative we always got along It was during those years that Mission Plaza was created which fueled the renaissance of Downtown San Luis Obispo But it was Steve who proved to be a visionary too Steve 's top issue was to create the city 's first public transportation system and he did just that Some 50 years later anyone who has used the city 's bus service owes Steve a debt of gratitude He just made this community a better place to live For those of us who were fortunate enough to know him we will never forget

Imagine Disneyland under feet of water for weeks Rivers swelling to levels never seen before and never seen since Days of rain stretch into weeks as floodwaters rise to epic levels California may have endured an onslaught of tropically infused atmospheric river storms that filled the calendar for months at the end of 2022 and the start of 2023 and is staring at another atmospheric river this weekend but those storms pale in comparison to the historic floods during the winter of 1861 1862 The storms were a recipe for disaster for a young region that had recently been settled Abraham Lincoln was president at the time and America was embroiled in the first months of the Civil War But out West California 's population was bulging to about a half million in the wake of the great Gold Rush about a dozen years prior Many of the newcomers settled in flat areas near the river for water supply and ease of commerce and transportation with mining ranching and agriculture the main fuel for the economy In the East where many came from floods occurred with thunderstorms in spring and summer not during the fall and winter They were also not accustomed to living near large mountain ranges that concentrate rainfall into confined riverbeds So when the first of a series of likely atmospheric river type storms hit the West Coast on Dec. 2 1861 it was a new experience for many The storm first struck Oregon 's Willamette Valley and southern Washington Territory according to research by meteorologist Larry Schick The temperature reading at Fort Vancouver in Washington Territory was 58 degrees at 7 a.m. well above average and signaling a warm tropically infused atmospheric river type storm that would have carried plenty of moisture Shick found the storm would dump so much rain it would flood the Willamette River with raging waters equal to the flow of the mighty Mississippi River a river 100 times larger Now 162 years later that storm still remains the flood of record for the Willamette It 's not alone Schick found the storm eventually pushed south and redeveloped into another atmospheric river type storm as it crashed into southern Oregon then Northern California The Sacramento River would jump from about 2 3 feet deep to 20 feet deep and set the first of four all time records that winter These sustained and multiple building river level peaks are rare and are testimony to the consistent magnitude of the series of storms Schick said As the end of December neared the storm track shifted to the south now aiming one juicy storm after another at California while the Pacific Northwest went into an eventual deep freeze Storms would keep smashing into California for the next 7 8 weeks Schick estimated that six of the storms would be categorized as at least exceptional atmospheric river storms Measurements on the Sacramento River indicate the first and most substantial rise in December peaking about Dec. 12 Schick said The river did not recede much after that Subsequent storms pushed it up to several more even higher peaks into mid January 1862 The flooding just would n't quit Widespread flooding swamped large stretches of Central California 's valleys In one stretch of valley that measured about 30 miles wide and 250 miles long water depths ranged from a few inches to 30 feet in some areas Telegraph poles were underwater It 's documented that Leland Stanford newly elected governor of California was rowed to his inauguration in flooded downtown Sacramento during the floods Schick said Many wanted to move the capital from Sacramento to San Francisco because of the flooding Damages to California included losing 25 of its tax base The state teetered with bankruptcy Southern California was n't spared as the relentless storm track moved south into the region in January 1862 The Santa Ana River in Southern California measured water flow on Jan. 22 at 318000 cubic feet per second about half the flow of the Mississippi River despite being a tiny fraction of its size Floodwaters stretched across the Los Angeles Basin and parts of Orange County south into San Diego Where Disneyland sits today would have been flooded under 2 4 feet of water for 3 6 weeks according to Schick Poor little Snow White would have been doing the backstroke to get to Tomorrowland he said Finally some of the cold air that had been freezing the Pacific Northwest sinks down and shuts off the storm track But not before leaving its icy mark across that region The Seattle area would drop below 0 degrees while the temp dropped to -29 degrees in Walla Walla and just 23 degrees in San Francisco The Columbia Willamette and Fraser rivers all froze solid It was the incredible amounts of water that fell from the sky that would leave the greatest mark Eight major rivers in the West still have the 1862 floods as their high water marks The Willamette Rogue and Klamath rivers in Oregon and the Stanislaus American Tuolomne Salinas and Santa Ana rivers in California Schick pointed out that the large floods of 1964 and 1996 on the Willamette may have reached those lofty levels if not for more modern day flood control efforts Proves dams and reservoirs can help Schick said The Salinas River caused major flooding earlier this year with the train of atmospheric rivers and reached a peak flood of 27 feet In 1862 the river reached 32 feet In addition the Colorado River 's largest flow measurement is also from 1862 at an incredible 400000 cubic feet per second due to massive snowmelt later in the spring The 50 day rainfall in San Francisco during last winter 's relentless storms peaked at 20.49 inches according to John Christy Ph.D. with the University of Alabama It 's a mere 63 of the 32.43 inches that fell during the 1861 62 storms Schick estimated that as impressive as the snowpack was in the Sierras this past winter it was likely 10 20 more in the winter of 1861 62 California 's Mammoth Mountain had 715 inches of seasonal snowfall in 2022 23 but Schick estimates snowfall reached around 840 inches in 1862 Some 16 feet of snow fell in the Holcomb Valley on the eastern slopes of the San Bernardino Mountains in 1862 THE SOUND OF SILENCE WHY IT 'S QUIETER AFTER A SNOWSTORM Schick said to put that winter in perspective take the flooding storms of this past year then add in the major flooding storms in Northern California in 1964 1986 and 1997 plus the major Southern California rainstorms of 1938 and 1969 and then you 'll see rivers approach or exceed those all time records About 4000 people died in the floods and the damage cost in today 's dollars is around an estimated $ 3 billion according to NOAA We must prepare but nothing will stop a repeat of 1861 62 or something even worse Schick said Most disturbing is that climate models suggest stronger atmospheric rivers in the future Climatologists estimate a storm of the magnitude of 1861 62 would occur about every 200 years Schick said his recent research using paleo sediment profiles indicated another series of atmospheric rivers that hit the area in the early 1600s may have even been much worse than 1862 So understanding modeling and preparing for repeat is really important Schick said Original article source Historic California floods of 1861 62 featured 8 weeks of atmospheric rivers\", 'link':

former NHLer Alex Formenton who is now playing in Switzerland all have been granted indefinite leave over the past four days The Globe and Mail citing two unnamed sources reported Wednesday the

unprecedented backlash against the sport 's governing body Hockey Canada 's governance and transparency were subsequently called into question leading to a series of parliamentary hearings Bloc

mandated the 19 players at the London gala speak to its own third party investigators The fallout was swift The federal government froze funding while several corporate sponsors paused support Hockey Canada reopened its third party investigation in July 2022 adding that player participation was now mandatory The Canadian Press was first to report later that month Hockey Canada maintained a fund

five players on the junior team The NHL also launched its own investigation which deputy commissioner Bill Daly said in June had concluded Along with Hockey Canada and the London police that made for three separate probes into an incident that has cast a long shadow over the sport in Canada Hockey Canada said in November the findings of its independent third party report are under appeal All

are depleting groundwater worldwide but there are ways to replenish it', 'excerpt': 'Rapid and accelerating groundwater level declines are widespread in dry climates where groundwater is used for irrigation But some communities have found ways to turn things around', 'summary': \"If you stand at practically any point on Earth there is water moving through the ground beneath your feet Groundwater provides about half of the world 's population with drinking water and nearly half of all water used to irrigate crops It sustains rivers lakes and wetlands during droughts Groundwater is a renewable resource but it can take decades or even centuries for some aquifers to recover after they are depleted Current understanding of this challenge is based mainly on where and how frequently people record measurements of water levels in wells In a newly published study our team of data scientists water specialists and policy experts compiled the first global scale dataset of these levels We analyzed millions of groundwater level measurements in 170000 wells located in over 40 countries and mapped how groundwater levels have changed over time Our study has two main findings First we show that rapid groundwater depletion is widespread around the world and that rates of decline have accelerated in recent decades with levels falling by 20 inches or more yearly in some locations Second however our research also reveals many cases where deliberate actions halted groundwater depletion These results show that societies are not inevitably doomed to drain their groundwater supplies and that with timely interventions this important resource can recover Many factors determine groundwater levels including geology climate and land use But groundwater levels that are dropping deeper and deeper in a particular location often signal that people are pumping it out faster than nature can replenish it Some of the 300 million measurements we compiled were recorded by automated measuring devices Many others were made in the field by people around the globe And these measurements paint a worrying picture They show that groundwater levels have declined since the year 2000 in far more places than they rose In many locations especially arid zones that are heavily farmed and irrigated groundwater levels are falling by more than 20 inches 0.5 meters per year Examples include Afghanistan Chile China Peninsular India Iran Mexico Morocco Saudi Arabia Spain and the U.S. Southwest Our second and more concerning finding is that in about one third of the areas where we compiled measurements the rate of groundwater decline is accelerating Accelerated groundwater decline is common in dry climates where large swaths of land are used for agriculture This suggests a potential link between groundwater fed irrigation and intensifying groundwater depletion Rapid and accelerating groundwater level declines have many harmful effects Drinking water supplies from wells and springs can run dry when groundwater levels decline People and communities who rely on those wells can lose access to what may be their sole source of accessible fresh water for drinking For example wells that supply fresh water to homes are running dry in California 's San Joaquin Valley where groundwater depletion has accelerated since the early 2000s This problem is likely to continue and worsen unless action is taken to stabilize groundwater reserves Wells that run dry can also threaten crop production Groundwater depletion has long been viewed as one of the greatest threats to global irrigated agriculture because wells supply nearly half of the water used for irrigation globally In areas where groundwater typically drains to rivers falling groundwater levels can reverse this flow and cause rivers to leak into the subsurface This affects the river 's ecology and reduces water supplies downstream In the U.S. leaky streams are more common where groundwater withdrawal rates are high highlighting how groundwater pumping can directly reduce the amount of water that flows underground into nearby rivers Groundwater declines can also cause land surfaces to sink Land subsidence has increased flood risks in dozens of coastal cities worldwide including Jakarta Tokyo Istanbul Mumbai Auckland and the Tampa Bay area of Florida Farther from the coast land subsidence can damage infrastructure It poses a critical challenge in areas where groundwater levels have declined including Tehran and Mexico City In many cases the main culprit is excessive groundwater pumping Finally falling groundwater can cause seawater to move inland underground and contaminate coastal groundwater systems a process known as seawater intrusion When seawater intrudes coastal aquifers can become too saline to use for drinking water without energy intensive desalination We also found places where groundwater levels are recovering The strategies that communities used to replenish their groundwater sources included developing new alternative water supplies such as local rivers adopting policies to reduce demand for groundwater and intentionally replenishing aquifers with surface water The town of El Dorado Arkansas saw its groundwater levels drop by roughly 200 feet 60 meters from 1940 through 2000 as local industries pumped water from the aquifer In 1999 a new policy established a pumping fee structure giving businesses an incentive to find a new water supply By 2005 a pipeline had been built to divert water from the Ouachita River to El Dorado This new source reduced demand for groundwater and groundwater levels have risen in the area since 2005 In Bangkok so many private wells were drilled for domestic industrial or commercial purposes between 1980 and 2000 that groundwater pumping doubled and groundwater levels fell Officials responded by quadrupling groundwater extraction fees between 2000 and 2006 Total groundwater pumping declined and levels began to recover as users found other water sources In a valley near Tucson Arizona groundwater levels declined by 100 feet 30 meters as withdrawals for irrigation increased after the 1940s To help replenish the depleted groundwater leaky ponds were constructed These ponds are filled with water from the Colorado River that is moved hundreds of miles to the area via canals As these ponds leak they refill the depleted aquifer Because of these leaky ponds groundwater levels in the valley have risen by about 200 feet 60 meters in places Our analysis shows how important it is to monitor groundwater levels in many locations With groundwater levels declining in many places communities and businesses that depend on it need accurate information about their water supplies so they can act

far lower than they 've ever been triggering an emergency response and an international crisis Pretty scary times said Jim Darling president of the Rio Grande Regional Water Authority and former mayor of McAllen We 'll see what happens Worries stretch beyond the Rio Grande In Corpus Christi on the South Texas coast authorities last month stopped releasing water aimed at maintaining minimum viable ecology in the coastal wetlands even as oil refineries and chemical plants remain exempt from water use restrictions during drought Also last month in the sprawling suburbs of Central Texas between Austin and San Antonio one groundwater district declared stage four drought for the first time in its 36 year history Texans do n't usually talk about drought in the winter Damp soil and green grass may conceal the impending predicament today but water planners in regions with low reserves nervously await what summer may bring Signs are not favorable said Greg Waller a coordinating hydrologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Fort Worth Expect warmer and drier again Winter and spring rains offer the best hope for relief he said but weather patterns so far have n't produced the sustained downpours needed to refill reservoirs Drought conditions in 2022 and 2023 struck with markedly acute severity Last year was the hottest on record for Texas and the Earth according to NOAA after a global heatwave shattered temperature records around the world These patterns Waller said are consistent with scientific understanding of climate change caused by carbon emissions Climate change means the extremes are going to get more extreme he said The heat waves are going to get more heat The droughts are going to get droughty er and the floods are going to get floody er Texas rainfall typically peaks in May. If relief does n't come by then some places will need to start bracing for impact Corpus Christi with 421000 people in its two county metro area sits where the Gulf Coast marshes meet the semi arid South Texas plains The region 's combined reservoirs dropped from 53.7 full in 2022 to 43.6 in 2023 to 30.5 this month The city announced in December that it would no longer release water from its reservoir system to support basic ecology in coastal bays and estuaries Wherever Texas rivers join the sea these once vast wetlands host critical reproductive cycles of many aquatic species and they depend on freshwater inflows for their characteristically half salty nutrient rich systems When water supply gets tight the bays and estuaries typically are first to see their allocations revoked while cities keep dam gates closed Due to the ongoing drought in our water supply wrote a city spokesperson in a statement NO water is being released from Lake Corpus Christi to the Bays and Estuaries These ecosystems which once benefited from all the water from the formerly undammed rivers of Texas have adapted to natural droughts Dry years severely decrease the amount of species reproduction but when wet weather returns the system can usually recover within a year according to Paul Montagna endowed chair of hydroecology at the Harte Research Institute for Gulf of Mexico Studies in Corpus Christi However if a system is permanently impaired it is also possible that recovery will not reach former levels Montagna said Studies suggest that systems around Corpus Christi may already be permanently impaired Montagna said largely due to a sustained lack of fresh water Similar problems span the lower Texas coast The Rio Grande has n't flowed consistently into the Gulf of Mexico since the early 2000s On the Colorado River which runs through Austin authorities have kept water releases to the coastal wetlands at a bare minimum in recent years Jennifer Walker director of the National Wildlife Foundation 's Texas Coast and Water Program called it critical life support Water to meet environmental needs is frequently the first to be negotiated away Walker said Our bays and estuaries are a hugely important part of Texas and they 're not something that would be easy to go back and fix In Corpus Christi a major refining and export hub for Texas shale oil and gas city authorities have imposed water use restrictions on residents with more to come if reservoir levels fall below 30 But the region 's largest industrial water consumers operate unabated thanks to a purchasable exemption from drought restrictions for industrial users 25 cents per 1000 gallons passed by the City Council in 2018 That includes users like ExxonMobil 's massive new plastics plant which is authorized to use up to 25 million gallons of water per day a quarter of the regional summertime water demand Industry can continue full bore through all of these drought stages and the estuary gets cut off early said a water resource consultant from Corpus Christi who requested anonymity to preserve his business relationship with the city I think it 's a looming disaster They are still trying to recruit all these water intensive industries along the coast Proceeds from the exemption program were supposed to fund development of seawater desalination plants that would expand the regional water supply and meet demands of a booming industrial buildout The first plant was initially planned to begin operations early last year but it remains mired in challenges and years away from breaking ground Meanwhile the industrial buildout continues Two hundred miles inland the five county region surrounding Austin has grown faster than any U.S. metro area for 12 straight years Its water supplies have n't In 2022 less water flowed into city reservoirs than ever before city staff said at a public water task force meeting on Tuesday Last year was only slightly better The largest reservoir serving Austin Lake Travis fell from about 80 full in January 2022 to 38 full at the start of this year Even in another extreme drought year Austin can avoid heightened water use restrictions which take effect when reservoirs fall below 30 full until at least July according to a water supply outlook presented at the meeting But the outlook stopped short of August and September the region 's hottest and recently driest months It 's not looking good said Robert Mace director of the Meadows Center for Water and the Environment at Texas State University and a member of the water task force Even if levels fall below 30 water users in Austin will face only minor restrictions focused mostly on car washing and lawn irrigation During the summer in Texas when water consumption can double or triple over wintertime use major cities spray most of their treated drinking water onto grass The problem worsens as more land converts to suburban subdivisions amid a homebuilding boom said Todd Votteler a water dispute consultant and editor of the Texas Water Journal a peer reviewed journal focused on water management and research Texas gained more residents and built more homes than any state in recent years One of the challenges is the idea for home builders and the real estate industry that all these new houses need to have beautiful green lawns said Votteler who has worked at groundwater and river authorities in Central Texas since 1994 People moving here from some place else have not lived in a region with a limited water supply Around Austin a patchwork of authorities manages various aquifers and reservoirs Last month the Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer Groundwater Conservation District declared stage four drought restrictions for the first time in its 36 year history That required the oldest communities and major companies in the district to reduce water use by 40 while 16 newer permit holders were cut off entirely The district 's customers include the city of Kyle the third fastest growing U.S. city in 2022 plus dozens of small water companies and utility districts We 've been concerned for years We 've been in one stage of drought or another for well over a year and a half now said Tim Loftus general manager of the Barton Springs Edwards Aquifer Groundwater Conservation District We just really need rain Loftus said his customers have risen to the occasion and complied with cuts Another district has n't been as lucky The neighboring Hays Trinity Groundwater Conservation District has fought for two years with a local subsidiary of a national investor owned water supply company over violations of permit pumping limits even as severe drought conditions have continued to deepen The company Aqua Texas has taken almost twice its permitted allotment for two consecutive years and has declined to abide by drought restrictions according to Charlie Flatten general manager of the Hays Trinity Groundwater Conservation District This month Aqua sued the conservation district in federal court Its legal brief did n't address whether Aqua had overpumped but accused the groundwater district of violating due process and of unequal application of its penalty policy It added that Aqua Texas has voluntarily spent millions of dollars in water conservation The groundwater district in legal documents has denied Aqua 's allegations We 're already seeing wells drying up not just in specific sections but across the district Flatten said As we continue to use water and there continues to be no recharge more and more wells will be affected Another major nearby water source the Canyon Lake reservoir started last year 80 full surpassed its record low of 68 in August and is 60 full today The biggest water problems in Texas lie along its southern border where some 6 million people in two countries depend on the dwindling Lower Rio Grande system At the river 's end amid the irrigated fields of the fertile Rio Grande Valley farmers have lost crops midseason in recent years due to water shortages This year many wo n't plant at all worried they will lose the investment to another summer drought said Darling the Rio Grande Regional Water Authority president That creates a spiraling conundrum for the flourishing cities of the Rio Grande Valley in Texas home to more than a million people he said The once prosperous agricultural sector historically accounts for more than 80 of water demand here Without its vast volumes flowing for irrigation the region 's network of canals would almost dry up Cities would lose more than half their water supply to evaporation and soil absorption along its 70 mile journey from the nearest reservoir There are two possible temporary remedies to this problem Darling said One is the weather The only other time the Rio Grande reservoirs fell as low as they have today around 2000 a hurricane soon hit and refilled them almost entirely A Pacific storm could also bring relief to the bulk of the Rio Grande watershed which covers the mountains of northwestern Mexico Another is international politics Because most of the water used by Texas farmers on the Lower Rio Grande originates as rainfall in Northern Mexico a binational treaty governs water sharing between the countries Northern Mexico has experienced its own water crises lately including a deadly riot at a reservoir dam in 2020 and months of water rationing in 2022 in one of the country 's largest cities So it 's been reluctant to release water for Texas farmers contributing to low levels in the downstream reservoirs Since 2020 Mexico has fallen sharply behind on its schedule of water releases to Texas under the treaty which was ratified in 1944 It has until the end of 2025 before it faces delinquency But the Rio Grande Valley of Texas might not have another two years to wait Darling said The political situation is managed primarily by the International Boundary and Water Commission a small agency operated by the U.S. and Mexico We are negotiating an agreement with Mexico intended to improve the predictability and reliability of Rio Grande water deliveries said an agency spokesperson Frank Fisher We hope this agreement will provide tools that will help users affected by supply shortages North of the border Fisher said water restrictions will be managed by the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality A TCEQ spokesperson Victoria Cann said the agency has warned users about declining storage and encouraged users to plan for water shortages TCEQ continues to advocate for water users on the Rio Grande by communicating to IBWC the need for Mexico to deliver on their water obligations under the 1944 Water Treaty Cann said Disclosure Exxon Mobil Corporation has been a financial supporter of The Texas

on X @LucasPeerman 10 Joe Vivian Classic This weekend 's wrestling tournament at Cibola High School was sort of an appetizer to next month 's main course the wrestling state championships And no match at the Vivian ended up being as tasty as the 139 pound final between Volcano Vista 's Xzavier Salazar and Española Valley 's Cruz Sandoval Neither grappler managed a point until five seconds were left in the six minute bout That 's when Salazar escaped from Sandoval 's clutches scoring a point and ultimately hoisting the trophy the win also helped the Hawks capture the Vivian team title The ending proved sweet for Salazar and sour for Sandoval who should be hungry for revenge 9 Hope Christian boys basketball Twice this season the Huskies have amassed 17 point leads over their opponents only to see the entirety of that margin disappear before ultimately escaping with a win The latest nearly blew it moment came in the Hope Christian Invitational championship game against St. Pius Some clutch free throws and threes helped Hope Christian 10 6 and ranked No 4 in Class 4A hang on and win its home tournament 59 54 The Huskies are clearly talented And if they play like the score 's tied no matter what the scoreboard says they may even be a title contender 8 Demarcus Thompson NMPreps.com named this Lovington defensive end and wide receiver the 2023 New Mexico Mr. Football No complaints from PPR Thompson a senior who helped lead the Wildcats to the 4A title was unquestionably the top DE 71 tackles 37.5 tackles for loss and 18.5 sacks and arguably the best WR 1179 yards and 18 touchdowns in the state With a slight 6 foot 180 pound frame Thompson has the option to be a preferred walk on at UNM and holds several offers from Division II programs according to online recruiting services Wherever Thompson goes whatever position he plays PPR is betting he finds a role to help his team win 7 Chloe Dozens of dachshunds enter only one is crowned a champion We 're talking about the annual Wiener Dog Races held during halftime of a New Mexico State men 's basketball game This year Chloe was the top dog again and it was n't even close The multiple time winning wiener won by several lengths at Thursday 's exhibition Hot dog 6 Habtom Samuel The Albuquerque Convention Center is no stranger to hosting indoor track and field events and on Saturday it was the site of the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Invitational Samuel UNM 's fabulous freshman runner clocked a sub four minute mile 3:59.12 to be exact setting not only a school record but also recording the fastest collegiate mile ever run at the convention center Samuel 's already a star and he 's quickly does it he do it any other way rising to track superstardom 5 Clark Sonnenberg Speaking of young sports prodigies this Albuquerque Academy senior etched his name on golf 's rising stars list with a win on the American Junior Golf Association tour Sonnenberg who is committed to UNM 's golf program set tournament records in winning the 54 hole Butterfield Bermuda Junior Championship on Jan. 12 14 His final round 66 and 8 under 205 were both unprecedented With the victory Sonnenberg jumped to No 202 on the AJGA rankings of best young golfers in the world previously he was just outside the top 1000 4 Valencia boys basketball On Jan. 10 the Jaguars dropped a hard fought 66 58 game at Valley but it is n't for their play on the court that this team gets a spot in PPR After the game the team decided to grab a bite to eat at a Whataburger in Albuquerque A patron later wrote Valencia High about what they witnessed at the restaurant that day and the Los Lunas school district published that letter on its social media In part the witness writes An elderly woman using a walker had been in the restaurant for a while and she seemed a bit out of it but she left on her own and said she was fine A minute later a few of the basketball players and a coach literally ran at full speed across the lobby to get out the door I looked and the old lady had fallen down into the parking lot The players and coach helped her up they even put her glasses back on for her and the coach walked her to the bus stop I just wanted to share that with you so you know what a great impression your team made on everyone there that day This is a win in our book Way to go Jaguars 3 Slurpee and Cheetos Milk Duds made an appearance in last week 's PPR This week the junk food du jour is a Slurpee and a bag of Cheetos from Circle K. In a postgame interview that 's what New Mexico State basketball coach Jason Hooten said is his go to snack to celebrate a big win And boy did his team ever have a big win Thursday a 72 70 come from behind victory over Western Kentucky in the Pan American Center Probably one of the greatest victories in my career in 31 years Hooten said referencing the record comeback from 23 down in the second half The Aggies followed with a 73 62 home win over Middle Tennessee on Saturday to improve to 3 1 in Conference USA is tied for the best league record Keep sugar crushin it Aggies 2 Jaelen House After the UNM men 's basketball team beat No 16 Utah State 99 86 at home Tuesday and downed Air Force 85 66 on the road Saturday any number of Lobos could have been in this spot Nelly Junior Joseph had his best game as a Lobo recording 26 points on 11 of-12 shooting eight rebounds five blocked shots and three steals against the Aggies or maybe Donovan Dent was deserving with his 15 points 14 assists three steals and one turnover in that game Do n't forget about JT Toppin the freshman who recorded his sixth double double of the season with 25 points and 13 rebounds in the win over the Falcons PPR is instead going with the senior guard who put up a combined 21 points three rebounds four assists and nine fouls over those two games House 's stats do n't always tell the full story Here 's the abbreviated version The Lobos are at their best when House is the court conductor And right now he 's got this soon to be ranked team humming 1 UNM women 's basketball What were the odds A $ 100 bet on the UNM women 's basketball team to beat No 25 UNLV in Las Vegas on Saturday would have netted the bettor a $ 1500 return In fact the Rebels were n't only predicted to win the oddsmakers had them winning by at least 21 points Consider the Rebels had won 22 straight at home and 29 straight against Mountain West foes The middling Lobos did n't have a chance did they Well as they say that 's why they play the game After 40 minutes the scoreboard read UNM 69 UNLV 66 a monumental upset This might be coach Mike Bradbury 's biggest win in his eight years at the helm and no doubt Viané Cumber 's three in the final seconds is the most clutch long distance shot from a Lobo men 's or women 's this season Add in Wednesday 's 68 61 home win over Wyoming a team that had n't lost a conference matchup this season heading into that game and the UNM women 's team is clearly having the best week in New Mexico sports Honorable mention Aliyah Logan and Rebecca Green Two members of the New Mexico State track and field team set school records this weekend at the MLK Invitational in Albuquerque Aliyah Logan broke her own school record in the 60 meter hurdles posting a time of 8.24 seconds and Rebecca Green posted a personal best of 15.76 meters in the shot put to break a record that had stood since 2006 UNM fans Tip of the hat to Lobo die hards who traveled to Colorado Springs to root on their men 's basketball team against Air Force on Saturday Coach Richard Pitino and players both mentioned how it almost felt like a home game Next challenge Sell out the Pit for next Sunday 's big game against Nevada Don Haskins OK this is n't technically in the Land of Enchantment but it 's worth mentioning in any column recognizing borderland excellence UTEP will be honoring the legendary Hall of Fame basketball coach with a statue outside of the stadium that bears his name The unveiling of the 7 foot statue will be Feb. 24 End of the bench The publishers of Illustrated

this is n't the end of the SI brand It 's too early to say with any confidence what happens next Readers of the PPR column in print almost assuredly were SI subscribers at some point For nearly 15 years first to SI for Kids and later to the weekly magazine I too devoured every word from Frank DeFord Rick Reilly Gary Smith and other extraordinary writers who inspired me to pursue journalism Hearing the SI news on Friday was a punch in the gut to 20 year old me But with the advent of social media and smartphones SI has n't been relevant in my life for at least a decade I 'm not proud of that fact and that 's why I 'm relegating myself to the end of the bench this week If you made it to the end of this column thank you Your continued support is paramount to keeping local sports

rabbit hole of questions later Sam added Led by remote workers who took social distancing to the extreme RV sales soared during the height of the pandemic But these buyers differed from the empty nesters and retirees that long defined this subculture The newbees are younger by about 20 years and more racially diverse These mobile families include a mix of traditional homeschoolers and newcomers who pulled up stakes during COVID In fact with RV sales returning to pre pandemic levels industry leaders are counting on this budding customer base for future growth This has always been an older generation and now it 's become our generation said Christian Axness 37 who left Sarasota Florida behind in 2017 with her husband and two children 2 and 4 at the time Last year she co founded Republic of Nomads with Stephanie Simpson a former private school teacher from Indiana where the majority of RVs are manufactured They plan group outings like the museum visit so parents do n't have

where students talked to local astronomers In January they took off for Baja California to pack in Spanish lessons oceanography and windsurfing SLIDESHOW These are not just surface level experiences Axness said but immersive events because of the nature of our lifestyles While a non stop road trip might sound lavish it does n't have to be Full time RVers range from families who aim to live debt free to those who drive six figure luxury vehicles For many families monthly living expenses are about the same as if they lived at home said Tiffany Johnsrud a mom of three from Dubuque Iowa We 're

discussed moving into a tiny house so getting one with wheels was n't a stretch Miley had no qualms about leaving I hated online school She said she learns more from books than virtual programs But as a roadschooler she gains much of her knowledge first hand I can tell you facts about the cities what there is to do there and the campground names she said Her favorite excursion so far was to Oregon where she tried cold plunging in freezing rivers We 've seen so many waterfalls The forests they have are just really pretty Other families took to the road long before COVID Victor and Robyn Robledo

adventure travel brand offering apparel virtual coaching and wellness courses The middle daughter is a charcoal artist and teaches a mindfulness class for kids The big hurdle for me was overcoming this fear that if my child does n't do traditional curriculum how will they get into college Robyn said She said her two youngest now 12 and 15 ca n't do algebra a missing skill that would alarm traditionalists But she does n't care What 's important to her is that they work as part of a team and develop communication and problem solving skills The ability to learn is more important than what you 're learning Others take a more conventional approach Axness estimated that about half the students in Republic of Nomads are also enrolled in online public schools The ability to learn is more

grocery stores It was the first mass shooting that had ever prompted Nuri to cry By the end of his trip other tragic attacks would leave 21 victims dead at an Uvalde Texas elementary school and seven shot and killed in Highland Park Further along in the Northeast Nuri faced a rough start On Day 10 he misread a traffic signal and caused a minor crash in Connecticut That night he stopped at a New Jersey hotel where he woke up to police and paramedics banging on his door a case of mistaken room number In Delaware three days later officers pulled him over for his car windows deep tint The universe is trying to stop me right now he recalled thinking I 'm going to keep going because if I can get past this I can get past everything else His wanderlust was reaffirmed farther down the Atlantic coast In Wilmington North Carolina he saw a woman traverse a shopping mall parking lot in a motorized wheelchair fixed with long stem sunflowers The woman told him she was a former cheerleader type She had dreamed of retiring to raise horses renovate her home and make art When she got sick and needed to begin using her wheelchair many of her plans like all the best ones went out the window I would tell the younger me to have more fun enjoy life and make a family she told Nuri Nuri continued into South Carolina through southeast Georgia and across the Florida panhandle his first trip to the South In New Orleans he splurged on the trip 's one fine meal a $ 100 feast of oysters shrimp gumbo and much needed cold beer He stopped the next day in Brookhaven a southern Mississippi town with a population around 11600 As Nuri edited photos in a cafe a man stopped him and struck up a conversation about cameras First the man offered Nuri a place to stay Nuri who for most of the trip slept reclined in his driver 's seat at rest stops quickly accepted At the man 's house the kind stranger next offered to teach Nuri how to ride a motorcycle The traveler again said yes After the thrilling ride Nuri 's first ever they talked more about the different world 's that raised them The man was shocked to learn Nuri had never shot a gun The stranger offered to let him hold a carefully unloaded M4 assault rifle Nuri 's palms were sweaty as he picked up the firearm he said The man told Nuri about the value he sees in guns and the importance of safety They talked about their shared belief that gun ownership should be carefully regulated Like 999 other strangers the man offered his advice Everyone has their own experiences and you ca n't judge them based on ones you 've had he said Headed West Nuri was surprised by the beauty of Arkansas Across Texas Oklahoma and New Mexico fields rolled on alongside the road He listened to playlists from over a decade ago as he drove reminded of a younger self When he got to Colorado Springs Nuri who stopped to wash at Planet Fitness locations throughout the trip had n't showered in three days Still whatever smell he had did n't put off Don Caskey who asked Nuri what he was doing after the traveler photographed a gift store cashier Caskey had his own roving project underway he told Nuri He had been diagnosed with stage 4 kidney cancer three years earlier and given little time to live Before his impending death he was getting matching tattoos with strangers The two men decided to share ink They both got a tattoo of a roll of film Caskey died last February I wish I would n't have worked as hard and as many hours I missed out on a lot of things When I got sick I lost everything but having nothing is when I got more than I ever had in my life Caskey offered in advice Having less is more I 'm telling you The biggest thing in the world you can have is human connection Without somebody else to live with nobody would want to be here Nuri continued on He drove a loop along the Peak to Peak Highway in the Rocky Mountains passed through the canyonlands of Utah and Arizona and stopped in Las Vegas On a casino floor a man who seemed to be having the worst day of his life declined to share advice and a dealer told him he could n't take photos there In California Nuri drove north along the Pacific Coast Highway When he stopped in Klamath a man at Paul 's Famous Smoked Salmon Jerky showed off a washed up whale 's skull I wish I had never been a drug addict or alcoholic he said when asked for advice The least welcoming folks came next in Washington The kindest quickly followed in Montana He worked his way back East In Chicago he got advice from 26 people across the city Everything you do do in moderation said a man walking his dog in Edgewater Spend time with yourself offered a young man standing outside a North Side convenience store It 's expensive to be an adult I would have prepared differently had I known said a woman walking out of a Target near Loyola University When you work hard for a consistent long amount of time the world opens up and gives you all sorts of new opportunities said a Millennium Park visitor in front of The Bean By the time Nuri pulled into the driveway of his father 's Columbus home to finish his journey common threads had emerged in the wisdom he was offered In fact the advice he 'd gotten often the sort of wisdom one might find on a coffee mug was so regularly repeated that Nuri had at first been frustrated But by the end he realized the things he was hearing over and over again were each the result of lives lived The persistent counsel started to seem like universal truths Some people said they wished they would have embraced themselves to become who they are earlier in life Many people wished they had traveled more Some would have gone to more concerts Others regretted not saving or graduating Strangers told Nuri they had learned deeply from their mistakes They told their hypothetical past selves to spend more time with family take care of their bodies enjoy the moment and hold out hope They said life is short There was a wisdom after experiencing more of life that you will experience bad things and you will move through them and you will eventually be OK too Nuri said As the trip ended Nuri decided he 'd share his photos and the bits of advice he collected by making a book Publishers turned him down but as social media posts of his travels spread he raised nearly $ 70000 to put out the coffee table collection himself The 672 page volume he made weighs 7 pounds Nuri thinks people can learn from him and from the people he spoke with that the world seems to abet those who chase their dreams The trip 's revelations made for a few personal changes in Nuri 's life He now sweats small stuff less prioritizes friendships more and is quicker to talk to strangers He 's even figured out what 'd he tell his younger self Basically just live life harder Nuri said Be open to things Do n't be judgmental And after being open minded about where he 'd live after the trip he also decided to return to Chicago with its hardworking people an action packed life easy transit and friends He moved into an Old Town high rise with his cats after developing his film It also shifted the way he saw Americans It 's kind of cliche he said But we all have a lot more in common with one another than we think Advice From America is available at advicefromamerica.com\", 'link':

change in the NHL brings back one of the biggest names in the sport as Patrick Roy takes over for Lane Lambert with the New York Islanders', 'summary': \"On Saturday he got it The New York Islanders announced that they 've brought Roy on board after firing Lane Lambert The 58 year old spent three seasons behind the bench of one of his former teams the Colorado Avalanche AVAX between 2013 and 2016 He put up a record of 130 92 24 for a .577 points percentage and won the Jack Adams Award as coach of the year in his first year But Colorado 's only playoff appearance also came that first year a seven game upset loss to the Minnesota Wild And Roy tarnished his opportunities for future NHL employment when he left the Avalanche in a bad spot Ahead of the 2016 17 season he decided in August that he would not to return stating that he did n't have enough say in the decisions that impact the team 's performance That left then GM Joe Sakic scrambling to find a replacement after most coaches were already in their roles for the upcoming season He was able to attract Jared Bednar fresh off a Calder Cup win with the AHL 's Lake Erie Monsters And while the Avalanche finished dead last in Bednar 's first season with just 48 points that set the team up to draft superstar defenseman Cale Makar with the fourth pick in the 2017 draft On ice performance also picked up quickly In 2018 the Avalanche returned to the playoffs for the first time in four seasons In 2022 they won the Stanley Cup And now Bednar is the third longest tenured coach in the NHL behind only fellow Cup winners Jon Cooper with the Tampa Bay Lightning and Mike Sullivan with the Pittsburgh Penguins As for Roy he spent two years away from hockey before returning to the Quebec Remparts of the Quebec Major Junior Hockey League where he had previously been team owner as well as head coach and general manager Once again Roy took over as coach and general manager He spent five seasons back with the team and after capturing the 2023 Memorial Cup with his group last June he stepped away making it clear that he was hoping to make an NHL return In 127 games Lambert amassed a record of 61 46 20 for a .559 points percentage Last spring the Islanders made the playoffs thanks to a strong second half but fell to the Carolina Hurricanes in the first round This year they 've been inconsistent at both ends of the ice but their record of 19 15 11 through 45 games has them in the mix for a playoff spot in the crowded Eastern Conference race just two points out of a wild card position following Friday 's games But on Friday night the Islanders lost their fourth straight game and sixth in their last seven when they dropped a 4 3 overtime decision to the struggling Chicago Blackhawks who sit second last in the league standings and are riddled with injuries including rookie prodigy Connor Bedard The Islanders have also had trouble drawing fans to their new UBS Arena this season They 're averaging 16075 fans per game this season fifth lowest in the league and down from 16912 last season As a player Lambert was a journeyman center who put up 123 points in 283 NHL games for three different teams between 1983 and 1989 Roy was a superstar who won two Stanley Cups with the Montreal Canadiens and two more with the Avalanche and was named the winner of the Conn Smythe Trophy as playoff MVP for three of those runs He also won three Vezina Trophies and his 551 career wins were second most of all time until he was passed by Marc Andre Fleury just a few days ago He 's an icon of the sport with a big personality who will draw eyeballs to an Islanders team that is regularly overshadowed by the New York Rangers and lately also by the New Jersey Devils in the Tri State area As of Saturday afternoon there is no word on whether there will be other changes to the Islanders coaching staff There wo n't be much time for Roy to get to know his players and prepare for his new assignment The Islanders

in four years he 's going to sign an advance directive for driving The directive will say that when his children want him to stop getting behind the wheel Morgenstern will follow their advice Wp Get the full experience Choose your plan ArrowRight I recognize that I might not be able to make the best decision about driving at a certain point and I want to make it clear I trust my children to take over that responsibility said Morgenstern a professor of neurology neurosurgery and emergency medicine at the University of Michigan His wife 59 intends to sign a similar document at 65 Skip to end of carousel Start the year fresh Katty Huertas The Post Start 2024 with practical tips and smart solutions for your health technology travel food money home and more Easy wins good habits better living Elevate your daily life with expertise from The Washington Post Find it all here End of carousel Morgenstern has given a lot of thought to the often divisive issue of when to stop driving In fact he is the co author of a recent article in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society that found 61 percent of older adults with cognitive impairment continued to drive even though 36 percent of their caregivers were concerned about their performance Advertisement Many of the seniors probably adapted by exercising caution and drawing on extensive experience behind the wheel Morgenstern said But he noted there is undoubtedly a group of people who are driving and should n't be because they 're a risk to themselves and to others Relatively few studies have looked at how many older adults with mild cognitive impairment or dementia continue to drive and there are n't any national standards on when people should hand over the car keys But the issue is a growing concern as the ranks of seniors in their 70s 80s and 90s the age group most likely to have cognitive impairment expand Nearly 50 million people 65 and older held driver 's licenses in 2021 a 38 percent increase from 2012 according to data compiled by AAA Almost 19 million were 75 or older a rise of 31 percent In that same period motor vehicle deaths among people 65 and older increased 34 percent reaching 7489 in 2021 The number of seniors injured in vehicle crashes that year exceeded 266000 according to the U.S. Transportation Department Risks for older drivers For the most part older drivers drive safely They use seat belts more often are intoxicated less often and are less likely to speed than younger adults Compared with younger and middle aged adults they 're involved in fewer fatal car crashes each year And they 're more likely to restrict where and when they drive following familiar routes avoiding heavily trafficked streets and not driving at night Advertisement Still risks for older drivers rise with advancing age and the onset of medical conditions such as arthritis glaucoma and Parkinson 's disease And when crashes occur seniors are more likely to be severely injured or die because they 're more vulnerable physically Cognitive impairment and dementia pose especially worrisome challenges because decision making attention judgment and risk assessment are compromised in people with these conditions This is a big challenge when it comes to driving because people do n't react appropriately and self regulate said Emmy Betz a professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine who has studied advance driving directives This was the case for Morgenstern 's beloved father in law who developed moderate Alzheimer 's disease in his 70s but remained convinced he was fit to drive After he got badly lost one day Morgenstern 's mother in law took away the car keys and he did n't understand why He was very unhappy Morgenstern said How advance directives work Morgenstern 's interest in advance directives for driving an option he recommends in his paper springs from this experience Advertisement Several types of directives exist One asks a person to name a family member or friend who will talk to them about whether it 's safe to continue driving AAA and the American Occupational Therapy Association have endorsed a directive of this kind which is not legally binding Obligations also run in the other direction with family members agreeing to help the person explore ways to keep driving if possible If not family members agree to help their loved one find other ways to get out and about by offering rides and helping them use public transportation carpooling services or volunteer driver programs Uber and Lyft which have created programs for seniors are newer frequently used options Share this article Share Another nonbinding directive endorsed by the Alzheimer 's Association recognizes that people with dementia will not be able to drive as their illness progresses It too names people who should raise concerns about driving when it becomes important But it goes further by stating I understand that I may forget that I can not drive anymore and may try to continue driving If this happens please know that I support all actions taken including removing or disabling my car to help ensure my safety and the safety of others Advertisement At the University of South Florida Health Lori Dee Grismore an occupational therapist and certified driving rehabilitation specialist said up to 75 percent of the seniors she evaluates have some type of cognitive impairment This becomes evident during the first part of Grismore 's comprehensive evaluation an interview about the person 's driving habits and recent problems a review of their medical history a vision exam a physical assessment and a battery of six cognitive tests If someone does n't have insight which is common they do n't understand why these tests have anything to do with driving she told me Driving and cognitive impairment If she thinks it 's safe Grismore then takes older adults out on the road checking their ability to follow directions make turns stay in their lanes maintain appropriate speeds and interpret signs among other performance measures Advertisement While most older adults with mild cognitive impairment pass these tests Grismore usually recommends retesting at regular intervals and imposing restrictions such as driving only close to home and staying off highways But she acknowledged there 's no guarantee seniors will remember these restrictions Grismore 's three hour assessment costs $ 420 Medicare does n't pay a barrier to seniors with low or fixed incomes Older adults and families interested in finding a driving rehab provider can consult an American Occupational Therapy Association directory at https://myaota.aota.org/driver_search/. Elin Schold Davis who coordinates the Older Driver Initiative at the occupational therapy association recommends getting an evaluation of this kind when someone is diagnosed with cognitive impairment or when family members begin to notice problems Advertisement We should all be planning for our changing transportation needs in our 70s 80s and 90s she said The hard part is that driving is associated with independence and this is such an emotional issue But the more people look ahead the more choice and control they can have Resources for older drivers Many people with cognitive impairment continue to drive and do n't want to stop There are no standards for when they should give up their car keys but planning ahead is recommended Here are some resources that offer guidance

parts these stolen cars are generally taken for a ride and dumped which makes them likely to be found following the theft albeit damaged mine was recovered in a parking lot a week after it was stolen Insurance companies have taken note Despite my good fortune in finding my car if you consider having to pay a $ 1000 deductible for damages lucky I 'm now faced with the hurdle of dealing with car insurance During one of my many calls with my insurance State Farm over the past month they informed me that they would no longer be insuring Kias or Hyundais in my area due to their proclivity for being stolen Because I 'm extra lucky where I live in Colorado has seen skyrocketing rates of car theft and Kias and Hyundais comprised 30 of all car thefts in Colorado Springs as of late 2023 I was given an estimate of five weeks for my repairs to be done partly due to the influx of these cars in shops But it 's not just State Farm that refuses to insure my Kia model When I was first searching for insurance before my car got stolen Progressive denied me on this same basis Some insurance agencies even use a loophole to deny theft claims if the cars were n't processed for fingerprints What I wish I had done to protect myself and my car While it 's easy to point fingers at social media or individual owners for the rise in crime Kia and Hyundai 's failure to add immobilizers in manufacturing is the real culprit Both are issuing free software updates to affected owners to help curb the issue You can also get free steering wheel locks from some law enforcement agencies or buy them online Hyundai owners can purchase a customized security kit at their local dealers Moving forward I 'll be parking in the garage or in front of another car in the driveway so this does n't happen again Plus while I have a Ring camera at my front door adding an extra camera that faces the street could be another deterrent But perhaps my most failsafe option to avoid being victimized by the Kia Boys is never to buy one of these cars again\", 'link': 'https://www.businessinsider.com/kia-car-stolen-tiktok-challenge-boys-how-prevent-theft-2024-1', 'author': 'Morgan Goldwich',

highest gun ownership rates in the United States But until recently it was taboo to draw a link between those two things', 'summary': \"LIV Health 's recently opened urgent care clinic is in a high profile location along one of Wyoming 's busiest streets Rachel Woolf for NPR CHEYENNE Wyo Shortly after Christina Williams fiancé died last spring her three daughters came to her crying They said they missed their dad It got to be too much for her I could n't handle my grief or my girls grief at the same time Williams says She made a plan as grief counselors call it to take her life that day But by chance a couple of hours later while stopped at a traffic light on Dell Range Boulevard in Cheyenne she saw a sign for LIV Health a newly opened mental health urgent care clinic She decided to drive in right then Without an appointment she was seen immediately by a crisis clinician and a psychiatric nurse practitioner One of the first questions that crisis clinician Sarai Guerrero Vasquez asked Williams when she first came in is now an increasingly normal standard across Wyoming Where are the guns stored at home I always assure them I 'm just a social worker I 'm not going to go into your house and take anything Guerrero Vasquez says I just want to make sure that you stay safe and if that means having a family member secure them for a little bit until you go through this bump life will resume Williams had already given hers to her best friend Soon after her visit to LIV Health she agreed to check herself into the hospital and has since been doing better getting regular counseling and help managing medications But Guerrero Vasquez says some patients resist getting more treatment because they 're afraid their guns will be confiscated This is the reality of suicide prevention work in a state with one of the highest gun ownership rates in the United States For most of the last decade Wyoming has also had one of the highest suicide rates and specifically high gun suicide rates Firearms are used in roughly 75 of suicides in the Cowboy State compared with just over 50 nationally In conservative Wyoming it was long seen as taboo to draw a link between guns and suicide But survivors and those who work in prevention say there are signs that this is finally changing with gun shops increasingly talking about safe storage of firearms and mental health professionals talking more with patients about the risks of easy access to guns during a mental health crisis There are a lot of theories behind why Wyoming alongside several of its neighbors in the Mountain West has had perennially high suicide rates It 's the least populated state in the nation and there are huge gaps in care People have to drive long distances on roads that often close for blizzards or wind There has also long been a stigma around getting help that cowboy up mentality of getting through the tough times But those who work on the front lines of suicide prevention say there 's another bigger elephant in the room And that 's all the guns and easy access to them One of the challenging aspects of working in the Rocky Mountain region is just the availability and accessibility of firearms says Brittany Wardle a prevention officer at Cheyenne Regional Medical Center Some days it feels very overwhelming because you think If we did n't have firearms to worry about what would suicide look like here But gun control in Wyoming is widely seen as being off the table It 's also unlikely the state will expand Medicaid anytime soon which experts say could increase mental health services Still those who work in suicide prevention see some incremental signs of progress Wyoming now has a locally staffed 988 suicide hotline Gov. Mark Gordon has been holding high profile suicide prevention forums in communities garnering press attention And efforts to expand mental health care to underserved places such as the new urgent care clinic in Cheyenne could serve as a model for other communities LIV Health has seen a 171 increase in patients since last year Similar clinics have been popping up around the country since 2020 In rural America it can take months to get a regular appointment with a mental health specialist and providers say people in crisis need help immediately Suicide by firearm is 97 lethal In the urgent care clinic 's lobby next to the requisite doctor 's office magazines LIV Health CEO Emily Loos restocks a basket full of free gun safety locks every couple of weeks Clinic staff members stress the importance of safely storing guns or giving them up temporarily in a time of crisis If we 're worried about impulsivity we say you can put the key somewhere up high where you really have to work to get to it Loos says If they 're hesitant to give up their firearm we 'll talk about making it harder to access within the home Even though Wyoming has remained at or near the top in the nation for per capita suicides B.J. Ayers is at least encouraged that folks are finally talking openly about keeping guns away from people in a moment of crisis It 's something she knows all too well The Cheyenne mother lost two sons to suicide more than a decade ago Both shot themselves I mean at what point do we say enough is enough Ayers says We need to talk about it We need to get the resources out to the people that are in crisis Unlike say intentional drug overdoses suicide by firearm is almost always lethal After her sons deaths Ayers who is 62 and works as an insurance agent channeled her grief into action starting a suicide prevention foundation It 's very disheartening when we stay up there she says of her state 's ranking on guns and suicide We do n't want to be first place in this A push for safe storage as an alternative to red flag laws In blue America the reflexive response to gun violence is often a move to restrict access to firearms With gun control a nonstarter here prevention workers like Lauren SinClair of the Department of Veterans Affairs talk instead about creating time and space between a person in crisis and a gun One recent week she had logged hundreds of miles in her Toyota hybrid minivan crisscrossing southern Wyoming visiting local gun shops and advocating for safe storage where a customer can bring their guns in and store them temporarily in a safe no questions asked At an unannounced drop in at Frontier Arms Supply in Cheyenne she explained to counter staff Maybe their teenager is in crisis or they themselves were just saying Hey I 'm not in the right space to have my firearm at home with me right now Can you hold that She was pleased to learn that the shop was already offering this service and getting willing participants SinClair lost her mother to suicide by firearm when she was a little girl She says that for too long suicide prevention and guns were completely siloed from one another in Wyoming They can coexist together mental health professionals talking about firearms firearms professionals talking about mental health SinClair says Those can exist together and I think for too long there was hesitancy It 's not yet clear how many gun shops are offering safe storage in Wyoming But it 's now more common for salespeople to hand out safety locks with purchases and to have taken suicide prevention trainings known as QPR classes question persuade refer A local prevention tool that does n't involve politics On the outskirts of the wind swept town of Laramie is Gold Spur Outfitters a specialty gun retailer popular with local college students Behind the store and warehouse floor is a huge metal vault On closer inspection it 's a secure room not unlike a large safe Co owner Lloyd Baker incorporated safe storage into his business model when he opened three years ago after seeing so many fellow veterans battling mental health challenges Something like this is not going to solve all the problems But it 's a start Baker says We 're not here to judge We 're not here to point fingers We 're here to reduce the stigma first off around firearm storage and mental health Baker is working with the new Firearms Research Center across town at the University of Wyoming to turn this into a model statewide He 's frustrated with what he sees as the gridlock in American politics Many liberals default to gun control and most conservatives just say no to anything We can provide tools to the people who do suicide prevention Baker says There are other options than going through state or federal government to try to fix a local problem Maybe we can do something locally He 's referring to the alternative to red flag laws which have been effective in blue states including next door in Colorado where a judge can temporarily remove guns during a mental health crisis In a rural culture where there 's often deep mistrust in government Baker says gun owners including some of his most loyal customers tend to have better relationships with their local dealers Still despite all the work underway Wyoming was expected to finish out 2023 at or near the top in the nation for suicides It 's frustrating to survivors like Kari Cochran who are turning their grief into action In Rock Springs she lost her 18 year old son last year to suicide He had battled mental health challenges his entire life and shot himself after going missing in February He left the house He talked about buying a gun At that point I did n't think he had access Cochran says Cochran a local hairdresser was elected to her local school board recently in part on a platform of increasing mental health access for students She says she 'll work as hard as she can to ensure that no other family has to endure the pain hers is going through It 's a system problem that just is going to continue to repeat itself until we show kids and talk to kids openly I mean guns are n't going away she says If you or someone you know may be considering suicide or be in crisis call or text

Year by David Sedaris', 'excerpt': 'Walking and talking with my friend Dawn', 'summary': \"Illustration by Mikel Jaso It was a midsummer afternoon and my old friend Dawn and I were walking from an un air conditioned Nepalese restaurant to our hotel in the dull flat town of Montrose Colorado The sun seemed larger than usual and brighter It felt as if we were under a broiler The road we were on was six lanes wide or maybe eight There was no sidewalk so we were pressed right up against the curb being passed by flatulent motorcycles their riders helmetless and eighteen wheel trucks that were equally loud but at least generated a breeze One of the many good things about Dawn is that she never complains about walking never says You told me it was only another few blocks an hour ago never moans that her feet are tired or so swollen that her shoes no longer fit The farther the better that 's our motto Our record is forty three miles in a single day ninety one thousand steps according to our Fitbits Where did you do this people ask when I boast about it It 's a question that baffles me If someone told me he 'd eaten seventy five corn dogs in one sitting my response would n't be Where but Why not seventy- six corn dogs Why not eighty We always talk about breaking our record going for a hundred thousand steps but now I worry that we might be too old and how weird is that I was nineteen when we met in the front hall of our dormitory at Kent State and Dawn was a year younger We know each other 's siblings and before they all died we knew each other 's parents as well Dawn 's father was a jazz musician who fell to his death in a skydiving accident when he was fifty Her mother was a former flight attendant who doted on her two sons but constantly picked at her daughter 's appearance though I 'll never understand why Dawn dresses like a Swiss person That is to say she looks at all times as if she is headed to the airport where she will fly business class Everything matches or is color coördinated usually in earth tones When I tell people that her wedding dress was brown she corrects me saying Not brown driftwood Which is brown She makes all her own clothes Dawn save for some socks and underwear though she could likely turn those out as well Of everyone I know she 'd fare best if forced to live in a secluded cabin or fifteenth century Europe She just has that look about her wiry and no nonsense Does n't own any makeup Smells like a cardboard box Dawn grows her hair out then chops it off to donate it to cancer patients What remains is naturally straw colored not a touch of gray and easy to imagine beneath a bonnet or a snood She has n't used an A.T.M. since 1990 when the machine ate her card and as for a phone forget it Ca n't make calls but can make yarn paper ink and some kind of non dairy ice cream that tastes like fallen leaves Dawn travels with me quite often when I 'm on tour She likes working the line writing people 's names on Post it notes and sticking them to the title pages of the books to be signed Who was that woman someone will invariably ask implying that Dawn had been strict or unfriendly Once in Uruguay I forced her to take a test that would determine whether she was autistic I 'd had my suspicions but became certain after we spent a Halloween together and I watched her hand miniature staplers and homemade granola bars to the trick or treaters who came to her door Kids do n't want crap like that I told her as one after another stomped off into the dark Sure they do she said I mean it 's the kind of stuff I 'd want Yes well you 're strange To my great surprise Dawn turned out not to be autistic What puts people off is most likely her body language the way she crosses her arms over her chest for example makes her look impatient Also her voice can be kind of flat Totally flat actually if she does n't know you What she says when I point it out I 'm friendly I 'm always friendly During the height of the pandemic a woman spit on Dawn We were in the grocery store and I had n't done anything to her she told me I guess she did n't like that I had a mask on One of Dawn 's lungs collapsed when she was in her late fifties so she was super cautious about Covid kept her face covered long after everyone else had returned to normal We were in Chicago together at O'Hare in the spring of 2022 when I told her she needed to take it off But she said Let it go I told her Everyone else has I felt like a director coercing an actress to unhook her bra for a sex scene Come on I said You can do this Start by just lowering it to your chin She took off her mask and then of course immediately got Covid a bad case too All my fault but she 's never held it against me Fifteen months later walking along the busy highway in Montrose Colorado we came upon three eighteen wheelers parked on a dusty lot The doors of one were open and inside were stacks of new smelling tires If you had a year do you think you could eat one of those I asked pausing to wipe the dirt and sweat off my forehead with a bandanna I 'd been carrying If you had to I mean Dawn looked inside the truck A tire Sure if it did n't kill me First thing I 'd do is cut it into three hundred and sixty five pieces then divide each of those into pill size portions I 'd eat throughout the day It was exactly what I would do I wonder what percentage of people would put it off to the last minute I said Can you imagine Time is almost up You have a knife in one hand a fork in the other and are staring down an untouched radial tire thinking Fuck A convertible roared by and we could briefly hear the music the driver was playing a song that neither of us would ever voluntarily listen to That 's what my brother would do put it off I told her Then there 'd be people who 'd wait until the last minute and beg you to help them It 's the Ant and the Grasshopper when you really think about it and though I 'm not proposing this if you had to cull the population I think this would be a pretty good way to do it Those who eat their tire by the deadline stay Those who put it off and make excuses die That seems fair Dawn said adding that kids could be given bicycle tires Our hotel in Montrose was so close to the airport we could hear car doors slamming as passengers were dropped off at the terminal Love you Call us when you get there It was a boxy chain place meat locker cold and smelling of chlorine But the young woman at the front desk who had a streak of blue in her hair and wore enough makeup for three people her size was efficient and welcoming While checking in earlier that afternoon we 'd learned that she 'd soon be taking the exam for her cosmetology license Her study book was beside her when we came in after lunch so we asked her to throw us a few test questions O.K. she said and glanced down squinting How long does it take for a lost toenail to grow back A year Dawn said quickly the way a contestant on a game show might adding that she and I lose them all the time The young woman took a half step back Why Because we walk so much I told her Every other month I 'll pull off a sock feel something hard inside of it and realize you 've lost a toenail Dawn said Sometimes I 'll tape mine back on she continued It gives the little membrane underneath more protection as it grows This was something that I had n't known You tape your toenails back on She looked down at her feet Well sure but not all of them The young woman 's next question had to do with pH balance Dawn got that answer right too though it may have been luck I mean it was multiple choice We were in Montrose because we had to fly out very early the next morning and so it seemed smarter to stay near the airport than in Telluride where my reading would take place Because I never got my license and Dawn is admittedly a hopelessly bad driver a man named Kevin had been hired to chauffeur us He was sixty I guessed and had graying hair gathered into a foot long ponytail When Kevin was young he and his brothers would set traps and catch muskrats and beavers Mountain lions as well Then we 'd skin 'em out and sell the pelts for clothes and school supplies he told us Dawn sitting beside me in the back seat mending a shirt that I had torn adjusted her glasses Killing mountain lions I do n't like that one bit I did n't like it either but what do I know of life in the West of growing up poor on the back of a horse Then too I 'm just not confrontational If someone told me he kept a dozen teen age girls locked in his basement as sex slaves I 'd likely ask Does it cost a lot to feed them Not Dawn though The other night we were in Beaver Creek I said to Kevin hoping to change the subject Have you been They have a store there that sells wine and spirits and is called Beaver Liquors No joke As he laughed we came upon a mean looking town where we were told True Grit had been filmed The hills surrounding it were scrub covered and severe crawling with snakes I suspected A sign in front of a church read It 's Not Hot as Hell A bit farther along the land was greener and Kevin pointed out Ralph Lauren 's nearly seventeen thousand acre Double RL Ranch Then he showed us a spot where a few nights earlier he 'd come upon a bear and her cub crossing the road They was taking their sweet time too he said I stopped right yonder and waited for them to reach the other side The land changed again an hour or so later as we neared Telluride Now there were steep mountains with red cliffs visible through the aspens Pronghorns get up there then kick damn rocks down on you Kevin said I had been on the fence about him but now felt certain that given a year he would have not only eaten his tire but helped someone else eat theirs Because of its film festival I 'd thought Telluride might be good sized but in fact it 's dinky only two and a half thousand year round residents We had arrived early and had an hour to wander about before returning for sound check Know someone for as long as I 've known Dawn and you figure you 've got pretty much everything covered at least in your pasts So it surprised me during our walk to learn that when she was seven she befriended a man of twenty six who lived not far from her family in Marion Ohio I do n't remember where we met He was single and I 'd go to his house after school Maybe we 'd play board games or go on bike rides depending on the weather He was a lot of fun We had discovered Telluride 's outdoor pool and were looking at the swimmers through the chain link fence What did your parents think I asked For a long time they did n't know Dawn said Then my dad found out After the two of them finally met he came to me saying You did n't mention that your friend Howard is deaf I was like Really I just thought he was quiet Quiet is letting the other person do most of the talking I told her Deaf is letting them do all of it That aside I love that no one made a big stink about it Can you imagine that happening now The man would be arrested along with the parents Everyone would go directly to jail except for the kid who 'd be in mandatory counselling for the rest of her life It 's startling to age and hear yourself talking like this When I was young a child could have a lonely adult bachelor as a friend He had a lot of javelins in his house Dawn recalled It turned out he 'd thrown them at the 64 Olympics That makes it even better I said brushing some cottonwood fluff from the back of her dress then leaving my hand to rest for a moment on her shoulder When people ask how I know Dawn I sometimes say She was my girlfriend my second year of college I always worry though that it makes her look dumb especially if I 'm at the theatre after a reading and am wearing a sports coat that for all intents and purposes is a gown She was my girlfriend though Held my hand as someone in our dorm basement pierced my ear Wrapped her arms around my waist as we sledded down the campus 's one decent hill Stayed up nights to help me with sculpture projects Everyone knew us as a couple We were in love Back at Kent State loving Dawn meant hating myself for being gay for being too cowardly to admit it and ultimately for hurting her the way I did I will forever be grateful that she forgave me and that we can be in love again How 's your little wife Hugh will ask after she and I have spent time together Does Dawn 's husband Matt behave this way I often wonder The thing is that she and I knew each other first before Hugh and Matt Before Reagan and AIDS Before computers and Fox News and Run DMC My feelings toward her are proprietary Though currently on loan to her husband and stepchildren in the city of Red Wing Minnesota Dawn is mine and although we 've never discussed it I 'm pretty sure I 'm hers as well I know because I can feel it When we 're travelling and when we 're apart In high altitude Telluride and sea level Singapore In Japan and the United Arab Emirates In Argentina and Iowa and all the places we go just so we can walk our toenails off and be together ♦\", 'link':

to New York The Post confirmed with a league source after the Czech center spent the past three weeks in his home country recovering from a suspected concussion The Rangers wanted to give Chytil a change of scenery in hopes it would help usher him back to full strength sooner rather than later Even if this is the positive injury news the Rangers have been waiting for and Chytil is able to return this season there 's no telling how long it will take the 24 year old to get back into game shape or how effective he would be upon his return That 's only put more weight on the moves president and general manager Chris Drury will have to make before the deadline The All Star break from Jan. 28 to Feb. 4 should serve as a check in point for Drury Depending on how close or far Chytil is from rejoining the Rangers at that point Drury will have a better idea of what sort of players he needs to be going after Trade talk Until the Chytil situation is cleared up here are a few trade scenarios the Blueshirts may want to consider If the Rangers feel they need another center 1 Adam Henrique Anaheim Ducks $ 5.825 million AAV pending unrestricted free agent 4 With a two goal outing against the Rangers on Sunday Adam Henrique offered the Rangers a glimpse of what he could do for them AP The Ducks center certainly looked like an intriguing option Sunday night when he scored twice in the first period before the Rangers ultimately stole a 5 2 win in Anaheim Despite some concerning defensive metrics which have come with playing for a struggling team Henrique can create five on five offense The Rangers may have to sweeten the deal to convince Anaheim to pick up some of his salary but in the name of bolstering the team 's five on five production it could be worth it 2 Elias Lindholm Calgary Flames $ 4.85 million AAV pending unrestricted free agent It 's unlikely Calgary will be able to extend Lindholm who probably would be an ideal addition behind Mika Zibanejad and Vincent Trocheck down the middle The Rangers probably would have to include their 2024 first round draft pick in an enticing trade package to make it happen If the Rangers do n't need another center 1 Jordan Eberle Seattle Kraken $ 5.5 million AAV pending unrestricted free agent The Kraken right wing would be an experienced addition to fill a hole in the top six for the Rangers As he 's shown with the Islanders in the past as well as during last season 's playoff run with Seattle Eberle can be a clutch postseason player Even at age 33 he still brings speed to any lineup 2 Anthony Duclair San Jose Sharks $ 3 million AAV pending unrestricted free agent 4 Traded two years after he was drafted by the Rangers Anthony Duclair has played for seven teams over his 10 year NHL career AP The Rangers third round pick in the 2013 NHL Draft would make for a fun reunion story Without long term injured reserve pool funds however Sharks GM Mike Grier would have to agree to retain at least half of Duclair 's AAV for him to be the low cost addition the Rangers would need him to be His two point performance on Dec. 3 at the Garden should have caught the Rangers attention Mailbag Recently I asked for questions on my Texts from the Blue Seats text message conversation with Sports+ members join here Here are the answers to some queries lightly edited for clarity that caught my eye What was the main reason Drury would n't hire Patrick Roy as Rangers coach this past spring Joseph Meliambro I 'm honestly very excited to see what Roy can do with the Islanders but I do n't necessarily think Drury whiffed on not hiring him Peter Laviolette 's temperament appears to be exactly what this Rangers team needs Not only is he detailed involved and instructional Laviolette also is particular about when he chooses to send a message or light a fire under the Rangers That 's the biggest question mark hanging over Roy as he steps to the helm of his second NHL team For better or for worse which is yet to be seen Roy is an always emotional coach whose stint in Colorado did n't lead to another NHL opportunity until eight years later Drury may have had conversations that deterred him from choosing Roy If I recall correctly in Laviolette 's introductory press conference he mentioned the need to increase the compete level from Day 1 in preparation for the intensity of the playoffs Do you think these competitive practices are having an adverse effect on the team Peter O 4 Rangers players appear to be embracing Peter Laviolette 's emphasis on highly competitive practices AP I 've thought about this possibility but it ca n't be overstated how much this Rangers team has seemed to enjoy Laviolette 's practices They are engaged every time they step on the ice regularly participating in new drills and remaining invested in the competition of it all I think the team 's recent struggles have more to do with the injuries that have caught up to them and the way Laviolette has ridden certain players during this rough stretch The Rangers are a one line or two line team on any given night lately and that 's what could be running them into the ground What do you think of Tom Wilson in a trade Michael Youngelman I wonder what Artemi Panarin would say Since Brennan Othmann brings the same level of energy as Will Cuylle do the Rangers plan on bringing him up soon Richard LePetri I do n't know if I 'd go as far to say the two bring the same energy Cuylle is much more physical willing to do the dirty work and he 's built for the NHL right now Othmann has more finesse and scoring but his three game cameo clearly did n't impress Laviolette enough to keep him around over Jonny Brodzinski Othmann would be better served finishing out the season in Hartford to continue developing his game and gaining confidence Is Brodzinski like a 4A baseball player Great as a minor leaguer and not very good as a major leaguer He constantly misses the net and can not get the numbers he got in the minors Eddie Brill 4 As valuable as Jonny Brodzinski has been at plugging holes in the Rangers lineup his lack of consistency has limited his overall impact AP It 's been clear for four seasons now that this is who Brodzinski is A reliable 13/14 forward who brings the right attitude and can be used to temporarily plug a hole in the lineup He 's been an important depth piece for the Rangers for some time and the kind of player every NHL team needs But the inconsistencies in his game is why he 's remained in this role Now that Kaapo Kakko is back do you think he stays on the top line I know he helps defensively but not sure if he brings enough offense to the mix Sanford Wiener At the moment Kakko probably is the best option for that right wing spot on the top line Though it would 've been nice to see what Cuylle could have done with a run in that spot which appeared to be the plan before Kakko was activated off long term injured reserve Putting Kakko back on the top line was probably the right move especially if Laviolette is trying not only to show his confidence in the Finnish wing but also to motivate Kakko to produce I also think if things do n't turn around before Drury can give Laviolette more top six right wingers to work with Jimmy Vesey could be another option for that spot\", 'link':

the Cubs lineup giving them much needed power from the left side they still have n't adequately addressed even with the trade acquisition of top-50 prospect Michael Busch For Bellinger it would be a return to an environment and hitting infrastructure where he thrived in a bounce back season that showed what he is still capable of when fully healthy Chicago Cubs center fielder Cody Bellinger is congratulated in the dugout after hitting a solo home run against the Los Angeles Dodgers at Wrigley Field on Thursday April 20 2023 Chris Sweda Chicago Tribune TNS President of baseball operations Jed Hoyer though has demonstrated over his three plus years in this position that the Cubs will be principled in how they operate in free agency Bellinger 's agent Scott Boras has also not been afraid to wait things out even if it means his top players do not sign until spring training is underway The Cubs ideally would like to have their roster in place by the time pitchers and catchers report to Mesa Ariz. on Feb. 14 Given how much work still needs to be done with three weeks to go that might not happen especially if the Cubs are willing to wait and see how Bellinger 's free agency courtship plays out We do n't have any fixed deadline general manager Carter Hawkins said earlier this month I think in a perfect world you have your team going into spring training I think a lot of these players that sign in March and into the season there 's just a tough transition phase to get back up to speed when you 're behind the eight ball that way It does n't mean that it ca n't work but just seems like it 's harder to work That 's anecdotal of course We would n't rule it out That 'd be foolish for us to rule anything out But yeah we 'd much prefer to get our team sooner than later If Bellinger 's Cubs teammates had any influence on whether the slugger returns he garnered unanimous support for a reunion recently during the Cubs Convention Right hander Kyle Hendricks credited Bellinger 's role in a collectively strong defense that took pressure off the pitching staff and what it would mean to have that type of dynamic player come back to Chicago though the veteran also understands this is a business Center fielder Pete Crow Armstrong hopes Bellinger re signs regardless of the impact it would have on his playing time Left fielder Ian Happ applauded Bellinger for going through what has become a prolonged free agent process and being in the tough part of negotiations at this point of the offseason still not knowing where he will play in 2024 and beyond Happ said part of why he agreed to a shorter three year extension was so the front office could pursue bigger longer term free agent deals in a win now environment Bellinger would certainly fit those parameters If they want to move on from me in three years that 's their prerogative and they can do it so I think they 're going to build the team in the best way that they see fit and as players we trust Jed and Carter to do that and give us a chance to compete at the top of the division and into the playoffs Happ said Chicago Cubs Cody Bellinger and Christopher Morel celebrate the win Wednesday Aug. 30 2023 at Wrigley Field Brian Cassella Chicago Tribune TNS Left hander Justin Steele said it was hard to describe the impact Bellinger had last year but that the Cubs would have a sizable hole to replace if he does n't return Everybody saw what he did on the field and it was obviously magnificent what he was able to do but the teammate and the person behind the player is by far the best attribute he has Steele said The guy showed up in the locker room every day with a smile on his face good vibes everybody wants to show up and talk to him that day So that for me that 's something that goes such a long way especially with young guys coming up Bellinger 's defensive flexibility would be a coveted asset for manager Craig Counsell and the Cubs roster construction Playing at an elite level in center field and first base did not go unappreciated by Dansby Swanson particularly with how it can help with mixing and matching with the lineup allowing a manager to press a few different buttons that not maybe any other team could Since signing with the Cubs last offseason Swanson has been in regular communication with Hoyer and Hawkins bouncing ideas off each other communicating openly and being honest with the shortstop when moves might be happening Swanson is confident that Bellinger or no Bellinger the front office is n't done improving a roster that fell one game short of the postseason At the end of the day they have a plan they know what they want Swanson said They know what they 're looking for The market overall has been slow I mean other than the billion dollars out west there really has n't been a ton They know that we need to get better and we will get better and I think you 've started to see that recently with some things starting to fall in place and I think that 's only going to continue to grow from there In 1916 the Chicago Cubs played their first game at Wrigley Field then known as Weeghman Park the Cubs defeated the Cincinnati

'summary': \"CU cinema alum Nick Houy is predicted to be a film editing Oscar nominee for his work on megahit Barbie Nick Houy thought about robbing the Chinese restaurant in Boulder where he worked He never would have done it of course but that 's the joy of storytelling Exploring your most out there ideas asking What if and making all your friends perform the script you wrote It was a heist movie called The Grand and Houy and his friends screened it in the gym for their classmates at New Vista High School one day at lunch They thought nobody would come but everybody came and it was really fun Houy recalls We all ate lunch and watched this movie I 'd shot on S VHS and Super 8 I remember thinking The sound in here is n't great it does n't look great but people seemed to enjoy it anyway The funny thing is he only wrote directed and shot the film so he 'd have something to edit That was what he really loved making sense and stories from hours of footage shaping scatters of stars into constellations Now when the Academy Award nominees for best film editing are announced Tuesday Houy is widely predicted to be one of them for his work editing Barbie For Houy a 2004 University of Colorado Boulder graduate in the Department of Cinema Studies and Moving Image Arts editing Barbie marked his third collaboration with director and screenwriter Greta Gerwig He also edited Lady Bird and Little Women and all were exciting artistic challenges in a career that he has steadily grown from that lunchtime screening of The Grand in his high school gym I think of the editor very much as one of the authors of a movie Houy says like a co writer or co director As an editor you 're also making the movie For me I 've always sought out the best footage I can edit A long time ago I realized that you can do anything with any group of footage and that 's very exciting Bringing images together Houy grew up in Colorado Springs the child of two copy editors so he 's always been familiar with the idea of making an artist 's work as clean as possible His parents also were movie fans and he remembers going to Poor Richard 's a Colorado Springs institution and restaurant bookstore hybrid with a tiny screening room that was the place for New Wave cinema When he was in third grade Houy and his mom moved to Boulder he attended Mapleton Elementary and she worked for CU Boulder with an office in Old Main When he started at New Vista High School he played drums in a punk band with an ever changing name and pursued his passion for photography especially black and white photography He began thinking about how found images and footage could coalesce into a film with the right editing He would rent a camera from community television in the Dairy Arts Center then rent a room there with two tape decks on which he learned to meld photography and his love of watching films through the art of editing I would get Super 8 cameras from yard sales and I remember meeting old men in parking lots who would have a trunk full of Super 8s and I 'd buy them for like $ 20 Houy says I 'd shoot Super 8 film and get it processed at now closed Jones General Store and Camera on the Hill He shot movies of every genre and they were mostly terrible he recalls with a laugh but he was doing it so he could have something to edit The first time I started editing even Super 8 movies I 'd have to splice it and put it together I was just like Yeah this is what I want to do he says Even if you 're doing something like making a video for someone like for a wedding just putting a few shots together and adding music that 's really exciting Then if you just go a little further and say What can I do with found footage So I would just go shoot and would make totally random found footage things which was really fun to do even more than drawing or being in a band or just shooting stills It was just more exciting While he was still in high school Houy took screenwriting and film production classes at CU Boulder and concentrated in film production when he became a student there He remembers rewatching Francois Truffaut 's The 400 Blows in a class taught by Ernesto Acevedo Muñoz and feeling profoundly moved by not only the storytelling but by how music and images and every other element of filmmaking can come together into something that resonates and lingers Persistence pays off After graduating Houy moved straight to New York City for the simple reason that he 'd always wanted to live there He had about $ 1000 and crashed on a friend 's couch while he worked at a video store and in his free time went from one post production house to the next leaving his resume and asking whether they 'd give him work doing well anything Finally he got a job moving furniture at Post Works a pre eminent film post production facility where he happened to meet a film colorist who hired him to be an assistant conforming editor In that role he took a low resolution film edit and increased the resolution so it could be color corrected That led to a position on Michael Moore 's film Sicko The film 's colorist Ben Murray was like Do you want to be my assistant conforming editor at night instead of making coffee We would be up all night working on the conform I would sleep under the theater and never go home because I much preferred to be working on a big movie and I really lucked out The Post Factory in those days everyone was working there Michel Gondry was down the hall the Coen brothers Sam Mendes anyone who was cutting in New York in the mid-2000s I saw Spike Lee and Godfrey Reggio when I was in college and I ran into both of them there I said to them Hey I saw you speak at CU Boulder I literally talked to them about them talking at CU Boulder which just shows to students out there go see those people when they talk even if it 's on Zoom because you might run into them He bumped into editor Anne McCabe in a Post Factory hallway when she was working on Adventureland and mentioned how much he loved one of her previous films You Can Count on Me And then I just kind of followed her around saying Please can I be your assistant editor for like a year Houy remembers She hired him to work on Top Five starring Chris Rock which Houy considers one of his biggest breaks Another was his experience working as an apprentice editor on 2008 's The Lucky Ones with editor Naomi Geraghty It was while working on The Lucky Ones that he was told one day that he needed to go pick up a mini fridge from another cutting room and bring it to the cutting room where he was working at the time because his colleagues did n't want to trek to the kitchen constantly While he was grabbing the fridge he met another apprentice editor named Jennifer Lame who edited Oppenheimer and is also considered an Academy Award frontrunner for film editing and they hit it off becoming good friends Lame ended up editing Frances Ha starring Greta Gerwig and directed by Noah Baumbach and she became Baumbach 's editor When Gerwig wrote the script for Lady Bird Lame recommended her friend Nick to edit the film and a creative partnership was born It was while partnering with Gerwig on Little Women that he realized he 'd reached a point in his career of working on Movies with a capital M When we got the first round of dailies the first shot was of a horse and carriage pulling up outside a house and that 's when I was like Oh this is a movie movie Movies that people love watching Barbie saw him ascending to another level of his career it was a comedy which he 'd never really worked with before it had elaborate choreographed dance sequences which he 'd never cut before and had not only an enormous studio budget but even more enormous expectations from fans worldwide We knew we had one thing against us Comedies just do n't do well at the box office these days Houy says That 's the ethos of the industry so we already were worried But I remember reading the script and almost crying Only Greta and Noah can write scripts like that so I knew we had it So then the challenge was just to make sure we did all of that justice these big comedy moments and big emotional moments and huge songs by huge artists Although he could have Houy never visited the Barbie sets in London or Los Angeles preferring instead to feel like I 'm as close to the audience member as I can be at all times he says I want to experience the film like an audience member and an audience member has never walked onto that set I want to be as fresh as possible so I 'm cutting from a place of me as the audience member I want to make a movie that I want to watch The film finished shooting on July 21 2022 and was released July 21 2023 so factoring in that a film must be completed at least a month before its release Houy and his colleagues had just 10 and a half months to complete the movie with visual effects music and everything else It was insane but I 'm very proud of that he says Houy currently is lending editing support on Bob Marley One Love and taking a bit of a breath following the enormous hit that Barbie became Reflecting on it I will always see things I wish we 'd done differently Houy says The old adage is you 're never done you either run out of time or money or both I always want to keep working to make a movie better until we run out of money or time so that when I watch it again I can be really proud of it I just want to make movies that people love watching Top image Warner Bros.

one of the most exciting and dynamic leagues in the world to our community on a permanent basis Led by Ryan and Ashley Smith SEG has been in discussions with NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman since early 2022 about its passion for having a team and why it believes that Utah is the ideal market for an NHL franchise NHL franchise decisions are decided exclusively by the NHL Board of Governors Should the NHL act favorably and grant SEG a franchise the team would either join the Utah Jazz in Delta Center on a temporary basis or begin play in the next several years upon the completion of a new state of the art hockey arena Delta Center has hosted five NHL games since 2018 as part of the LA Kings Frozen Fury preseason exhibition series The location for a potential new arena designated for hockey has yet to be determined Utah has a long history with hockey the strongest economy in the nation a passionate sports fanbase and the youngest and most active population These factors make Utah ripe for the expansion of our sports and entertainment community We could n't be more excited about the opportunity to welcome the NHL said Governor Spencer Cox With the Olympic bid underway our long standing reputation as one of the greatest winter sports capitals in the world and with the proven leadership of Ryan and Ashley Smith and SEG in our community I am extremely optimistic about the future of Utah There is a great hockey legacy in Utah The state 's first ever professional hockey team dates back to 1969 with the debut of the Salt Lake Golden Eagles who played until 1994 When professional hockey returned to Utah in 1995 as part of the International Hockey League with the Denver Grizzlies becoming the Utah Grizzlies the Utah Grizzlies won the league 's Turner Cup Championship during the 1995 96 season Today the Utah Grizzlies are the East Coast Hockey League ECHL affiliate of the NHL 's Colorado Avalanche All eyes are on Utah for the recent and rapid evolution of our sports landscape especially with the Utah Royals back this spring and Salt Lake City 's Olympic bid underway There is so much momentum happening at the state level around global sports and sports infrastructure said Smith While Delta Center is ready to serve as an interim solution for an NHL team Utah will need a new arena designed for professional and Olympic hockey Having Smith Entertainment Group pursue bringing professional hockey to Utah could not come at a better time said Fraser Bullock chair of the Salt Lake City Utah Committee for the Games the group preparing to bring the Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games back to the United States With the Olympics all but certain to return to Utah a new state of the art hockey specific arena would be a huge contribution to our ability to host a world class Games including the Women 's and Men 's gold medal hockey games And bringing professional hockey to Utah will further help cement Utah 's place as a premier destination for winter sports The Salt Lake City Utah Committee for the Games is excited to work with SEG on the Olympics and what that will mean for sports and entertainment in Utah long term The growth of the NHL 's business combined with the quality of the on ice product have provided the League with great momentum By virtually every metric interest in the NHL has never been higher The interest is reflected in national broadcast ratings on ESPN and TNT that are up by almost 30 over last season Attendance is also at an all time high Through the first half of the 2023 24 season the League has averaged more than 17000 fans per game playing to 96.5 of capacity The game on the ice has never been better with offense at its highest levels in more than 25 years The League also has an unmatched competitive balance averaging a 35 turnover in playoff teams every year under its current playoff system and nearly half of all games seeing a team overcome a deficit to win SEG is committed to developing incredible assets and creating memorable experiences that bring the community together Since its founding in December 2020 with the purchase of the Utah Jazz and Delta Center SEG has rapidly expanded its portfolio as part of its commitment to Utah and to showcasing the state as a premier sports and entertainment destination In January 2022 SEG invested in Real Salt Lake which expanded to encompass the Utah Royals upon their return to the state for the 2024 National Women 's Soccer League season Between August 2022 and July 2023 SEG secured two UFC pay per view fights at Delta Center among dozens of other high profile shows many of which had never previously visited Utah In June 2023 SEG announced the launch of SEG Media a new sports media division which made an immediate impact on the way Utah fans could consume sports specifically distributing Utah Jazz games through a combination of an over the air TV channel a subscription based streaming service and other network partnerships SEG Media 's future plans include producing and distributing content for other SEG entities and external partners such as the NHL\", 'link':

Through all these years Matt LeCroy has done his best to maintain plausible deniability so apologies are due for this reveal that one of Joe Mauer 's first game worn jerseys from the Major Leagues resides not in a display case somewhere at Target Field but in a frame on a wall in LeCroy 's guest house in South Carolina To this day that 's one of my most special jerseys you know with it being game used said LeCroy who caught alongside Mauer in the Majors for parts of three seasons It was one of his first ones And you know hopefully the Twins do n't call me and ask for it Just ask Bryan Kennedy the catcher who was drafted out of Long Beach State 23 rounds after Mauer in that 2001 MLB Draft and backed up the future Hall of Famer in the Minors Twenty three years later of course Kennedy still remembers when Mauer arrived in little Elizabethton Tenn. after that Draft at the Twins longtime Rookie level affiliate in the Appalachian League There was a wow factor for sure everyone had heard about the three sport star who had passed up a scholarship to play quarterback for Florida State under Bobby Bowden I was just amazed by his ability to receive the ball says Kennedy now Athletic Coordinator and head baseball coach for the Western Christian Schools in Southern California The biggest thing to me was how he threw the ball behind the plate I did n't even like to take infield outfield drills with him because his arm was so much better than mine I hated throwing behind him Mauer went down to his first big league Spring Training at age 18 before the 2002 regular season where he shared the Fort Myers clubhouse with LeCroy for the first time The first order of business for LeCroy now the manager of Washington 's Triple A affiliate in Rochester was to give Mauer some good old fashioned ribbing Atlantic Coast Conference style because LeCroy is a proud Clemson Tiger and still a season ticket holder and Mauer of course had committed to their rivals in Tallahassee The second order of business was to start planting the seed for Mauer to get him one of those first big league jerseys because from watching Mauer tear up that first Spring Training while barely old enough to sign his own legal documents LeCroy immediately knew that his MLB career was going to be special I just remember his first at bat LeCroy said I believe he walked if I 'm not mistaken And just watching him he did n't panic He was n't over aggressive I mean it was just I 'm sitting here going Man I ca n't imagine being here at 18 years old competing at this level And with how easy it was You just knew It 's difficult to fact check anecdotes from Spring Training 2002 but given this is Mauer and a story about an impressive walk it passes the sniff test Whether that was a walk or a single up the middle or a double roped on a line to left center it would have been quite apt for the big league career that started in 2004 a year before veteran Mike Redmond arrived to serve as Mauer 's backup and mentor for five seasons spanning the astonishing peak of Mauer 's career Redmond says his favorite moments of all were when they were technically meant to be shagging batting practice balls in the infield but would instead just stand and talk through that day 's lineup the hitters tendencies and their plan of attack Mauer progressed as a player plenty through that remarkable 2009 MVP season but Redmond 's greatest point of pride was in watching Mauer grow as a leader in the clubhouse and of the pitching staff which took time even for the wonder kid for whom the physical game always came so easily Sometimes as a young player that growth takes a little bit of time said Redmond now the bench coach of the Colorado Rockies The step that I saw was just the leadership Him taking the reins and when you had to have a tough conversation you had a tough conversation whether you liked it or not and whether you wanted to do it or not because you knew that the team was relying on that These guys always knew what was in store for Mauer if he were to stay healthy and even though his body did n't allow for him to catch his entire career he still made an indelible mark as one of the greatest to ever strap on the catcher 's gear Now the Hall of Fame electorate has said as much too and resoundingly It 'll be really cool just because I probably did n't help him at all but just I just remember when the coaches came to me and were like Hey can you help Joe with pitch calling Kennedy said Not that I helped him at all but just for me and being drafted in the same year as him it was kind of a cool thing I tell people all the time that I was Joe Mauer 's backup It 'll feel like a proud moment when he goes in Not that I had anything to do with it but just that I got to see a little bit of this\", 'link': 'https://www.mlb.com/news/matt-lecroy-has-one-of-joe-mauer-s-first-twins-jerseys', 'author': 'Do-Hyoung Park', 'published_date': '2024-01-24', 'image_link':

the Minor Leagues Beltré signed with the Dodgers as an amateur free agent out of the Dominican Republic in 1994 He made his professional debut in 1996 with the Single A Savannah Sand Gnats In 68 South Atlantic League games the four time All Star slashed .307/.406/.586 with 16 home runs three triples 14 doubles 59 RBIs and 48 runs scored That effort quickly earned him a promotion to the High A San Bernardino Stampede where he continued to pummel the ball finishing his rookie campaign with 26 total dingers four triples and 27 doubles while driving in 99 runs over 131 contests Since I was a little kid all I knew was baseball Beltré whose father cousin and uncle all played the game told MLB Network on Tuesday That was all I knew growing up I just fell in love with it Once I hit 13 14 I knew that was going to be my life and I got dedicated to it He spent his second pro season with High A Vero Beach The five time Gold Glove winner was not fazed by the change of scenery showing his durability while also continuing to flex He batted .317/.407/.561 with 26 homers 104 RBIs and 95 runs scored in 123 games After opening the 1998 season with Double A San Antonio Beltré lasted just 64 more games in the Minor Leagues before making the jump to The Show on June 24 for his big league debut as a 19 year old with the Dodgers He went on to play 21 total seasons with L.A. Seattle Boston and Texas and finished his career with 3166 hits 477 homers and the third highest Wins Above Replacement 93.5 mark of any third baseman in history Once I got signed and came to the Minor Leagues and got to the big leagues I always loved the game but I was n't able to enjoy it the way I wanted to Beltré said And once I understood that it 's just a game and not a business and allowed myself to enjoy what I did back then I was able to be a better player The 44 year old becomes just the fifth player born in the Dominican Republic to reach the Hall of Fame is the only infielder other than Derek Jeter to notch 3000 hits and win five Gold Gloves and finished in the top 10 of the MVP voting six times including a runner up finish with the Dodgers in 2004 He also notched a .942 OPS in 325 total Minor League games I understood that I had talent but it took me a little longer to master it and be able to understand what I need to get better at Beltré said Once you get the experience it gets a little easier Mauer became just the fourth No 1 overall Draft pick elected to the Hall of Fame Harold Baines Ken Griffey Jr. and Chipper Jones are the others He is also just the third catcher to get in on the first ballot Johnny Bench and Iván Pudge Rodríguez being the others The St. Paul Minnesota native was selected first in the 2001 Draft by his hometown Minnesota Twins That year he reported to the Rookie level Elizabethton Twins and immediately lived up to the hype of a top overall selection Mauer hit just about everything in sight slashing .400/.492/.491 over 32 games while also showing advanced tools behind the plate He made his full season debut the following year with Single A Quad Cities and continued to show that his rookie campaign was no fluke In 110 contests for the River Bandits Mauer hit .302 with 28 extra base hits 62 RBIs and walked 61 times versus 42 strikeouts In 2003 the elite backstop split the season between High A Fort Myers and Double A New Britain and seemed to improve at each stop In 135 total games that season Mauer slashed .338/.398/.434 with 37 extra base hits 85 RBIs and 73 runs scored He also appeared in baseball 's Future 's Game that summer Mauer appeared in only 277 Minor League games before breaking camp with the big league squad in 2004 and making his debut in The Show at 20 years old on Opening Day that year He went on to become a six time All Star five time Silver Slugger three time batting champ and the 2009 AL MVP He 's the only catcher with three batting titles Few people have embodied the values and spirit of the Minnesota Twins like Joe Mauer Twins president and CEO Dave St. Peter said in a statement From the moment his name was called on Draft day in 2001 Joe has been a true hometown hero and a cornerstone of our organization His humility leadership kindness and care for others paired with his unparalleled excellence on the diamond have made him a role model for generations of youth across our region Mauer is also the most recent draftee to find his way to Cooperstown and by a long shot the most recent draftee inducted into the Hall before him was Roy Halladay who was drafted in 1995 Mauer 's induction also marks the second shortest period of time between being drafted and elected into the Hall of Fame 23 years He trails only his longtime idol Kirby Puckett who did it in 19 years I had a couple guys that I looked up to but number one was Kirby Puckett Mauer said He was my guy Just the joy he had for the game And you know I keep talking about joining a special fraternity definitely excited to be there with him Helton like Mauer was also a first round Draft selection taken No 8 overall in 1995 by the Rockies The duo become the 16th and 17th first rounders to head to Cooperstown You know it 's something that you do n't play for but obviously it 's the greatest reward you can have as a baseball player Helton said Originally drafted by the Padres in the second round out of high school in 1992 Helton elected to attend the University of Tennessee instead and it paid off for the slick fielding first baseman Shortly after being selected by Colorado three years later Helton joined the Single A Asheville Tourists for 54 games where he hit .254 with 13 extra base hits He showed enough there to open the following season with Double A New Haven where he really took off slashing .332/.425/.486 with 33 extra base hits and walked more 51 than he struck out 37 over 93 Eastern League games That effort earned Helton a late season promotion to Triple A Colorado Springs where he made the most of the hitting haven that is the Pacific Coast League batting .352/.439/.521 in 21 contests Helton returned to the PCL in 1997 and continued his barrage on the pitching there slashing .352/.434/.564 with 16 homers two triples 31 doubles and 88 RBIs for 99 games until he was called up for his big league debut on Aug. 2 The 50 year old went on to play his entire 17 year MLB career with the Rockies A five time All Star and four time Silver Slugger Helton also won three Gold Gloves at first base He led the Majors with a .372 average in 2000 and finished his career with more walks 1335 than strikeouts 1175 You never know when the one kid is there that that 's his first time watching you play Helton said So that 's what I thought about when I went out there to play is to try to show the younger kids how to play the right way\", 'link':

Rookies of the Year after putting together tremendous seasons for the D backs and Orioles respectively But there were several other rookies from last year who showed flashes of what could make them stars in the future These rookies may have had strong starts before fading later in the season or perhaps they excelled in one facet of the game while struggling in another But they have a chance to take a big step forward during their sophomore campaigns in 2024 Here 's a look at 10 players entering Year No 2 with an eye toward doing just that But the phenom cooled off considerably after that From June 24 through the end of the season he posted a .643 OPS with a 35 strikeout rate De La Cruz who just turned 22 earlier this month has all the makings of a superstar he had an average arm strength of 95.9 mph in his rookie campaign and his Sprint Speed was 30.5 feet per second tied with Bobby Witt Jr. for the best in the Majors If De La Cruz can figure things out at the plate he could become one of the best players in the game Hunter Brown Astros Brown was fantastic over his first seven Major League appearances in 2022 posting a 0.89 ERA over 20 1/3 innings He started off strong in his first full big league season pitching to a 2.37 ERA last April He showed some inconsistency through the remainder of the season 's first half but still owned a 3.64 ERA through June From there things started falling apart Brown began to exhibit command issues and was potentially fatigued as he crossed the 100 inning threshold he had never thrown more than 126 1/3 innings in a single season as a professional to that point Over his final 16 appearances 14 starts his ERA was 6.95 With a full MLB season behind him Brown Houston 's top pitching prospect when he debuted in 2022 could take a big step forward in 2024 particularly given his arsenal With a fastball that reaches 99 mph and an assortment of effective secondary offerings we could see a breakout sophomore campaign Jordan Walker Cardinals Walker the Cardinals No 1 prospect heading into last season was sensational to begin his MLB career in 23 tying Eddie Murphy 's 1912 record of 12 consecutive games with a hit to start a career by a player 20 years old or younger But Walker hit just .192 over the next eight games and was optioned to Triple A Memphis Upon Walker 's return in June he began to heat up again at the plate He hit .338/.427/.549 that month before posting a .756 OPS the rest of the season As he heads into the 2024 campaign he 'll look to have a more consistent sophomore season in which he is n't bouncing back and forth between Memphis and St. Louis That in itself could lead to a much better performance in 24 Anthony Volpe Yankees Volpe was the Yankees No 1 prospect heading into last season and while some of his numbers at the plate left a lot to be desired his stellar defense at shortstop earned him a Gold Glove Award for his rookie campaign While he hit only .209 with a .666 OPS Volpe did launch 21 homers and steal 24 bases in 2023 That bodes well for the 22 year old going forward And that .209 batting average involved some bad luck according to Statcast Volpe 's expected batting average last year was .230 Year 2 could bring a significant stride forward for the young shortstop who grew up in New Jersey wanting to be a Yankee someday After a 3.3- bWAR performance in 2023 24 may have some big things in store for Volpe Francisco Alvarez Mets Alvarez made quite the impression with the Mets in 2023 After smashing a 439 foot home run for his first MLB hit on the penultimate day of the 2022 regular season he belted 25 more last year Only three catchers in AL NL history hit more than 25 homers as a rookie Mike Piazza 35 in 1993 Matt Nokes 32 in 1997 and Wilin Rosario 28 in 2012 The impressive slugging notwithstanding Alvarez was a below average hitter overall He finished with a .721 OPS 95 OPS+ which leaves plenty of room for the 22 year old backstop to get better The key will be for him to cut down on the strikeouts he struck out 26 of the time last season His hard hit rate 45.1 and barrel rate 12.8 were strong If he connects more often in 2024 that should lead to better results across the board Defensively there 's room to improve his blocking and particularly his throwing he threw out 13 of runners attempting to steal well below the league average of 19 His framing was excellent as a rookie with his 9 catcher framing runs ranking fourth in baseball Grayson Rodriguez Orioles Baltimore 's top pitching prospect entering 2023 and the No 2 prospect overall in the organization Rodriguez made his debut with the Orioles last April and struggled during the first half of the season But he turned things around dramatically posting a 2.26 ERA over his final 12 starts Rodriguez who stands 6 foot-5 showed what he could do despite a rough start His changeup and slider were particularly effective with run values of 7 and 8 respectively Opponents hit .201 against the changeup and .155 against the slider and the latter generated a 34.1 whiff rate With a four seamer that averaged 97.4 mph and also a curveball and cutter he mixes in from time to time the 24 year old appears to have a bright future ahead of him And that begins with the 2024 campaign in which Rodriguez is primed to make major strides Joey Wiemer Brewers Wiemer among several top prospects who made their debut with the Brewers last season struggled to a .645 OPS in 410 plate appearances during his rookie year He did hit 13 homers but his swing mechanics seemed to be detrimental to his timing against big league pitching He has reportedly worked some things out mechanically which could lead to better results in 2024 Despite his issues at the plate Wiemer was very good defensively finishing with 7 Outs Above Average in the outfield to put him on par with the likes of Michael Harris II and Alek Thomas in that department If he can straighten things out at the plate Wiemer could become a valuable all around threat for Milwaukee Ezequiel Tovar Rockies When Tovar made his MLB debut as Colorado 's Opening Day shortstop last season his reputation as an excellent defender preceded him How well he would fare at the plate was uncertain While the altitude of Coors Field makes evaluating that somewhat challenging his offensive production was pretty much what you might expect the 22 year old hit .253/.287/.408 although he did have 37 doubles and 15 homers The defense was fantastic Tovar 's 13 defensive runs saved were fourth among MLB shortstops and his 16 Outs Above Average tied him for sixth in baseball among all position players Is there more in the bat Tovar showed flashes of impressive pop particularly to the opposite field during his rookie season He also had an above average Sweet Spot rate putting the ball in play within an optimal launch angle range 36.4 of the time For that to really help him though he 'll have to raise his hard hit rate of 36.2 Tovar is certainly going to be a Gold Glove Award candidate going into his sophomore season If he can add some value at the plate he 'll take a big step in the right direction in 2024 Patrick Bailey Giants Bailey was one of the best defensive catchers in baseball in 2023 not bad for a guy who had never caught in the big leagues before making his debut on May 19 He led all MLB backstops with 16 catcher framing runs per Statcast He was also second only to the D backs Gabriel Moreno with a Caught Stealing Above Average score of 6 and tied for second with an average pop time on throws to second base of 1.87 seconds Offensively Bailey is a work in progress He was n't a slugger in the Minors but he showed the potential to be a better hitter than his rookie slash line of .233/.285/.359 would indicate His 10 barrel rate and 36.2 Sweet Spot rate certainly give him something to build on at the plate Year 2 for the 24 year old could be big for him if his defense only gets better with more experience and his hitting starts to come along too Davis hit .213/.302/.351 with seven homers in 255 plate appearances in his first taste of the Majors This offseason he 's been working with Driveline to enhance his performance at the plate and as far as improving behind it he 's been catching bullpens at the Pirates Spring Training complex in Bradenton Fla. One of those bullpen sessions was with another No 1 overall pick in the Draft by the Pirates hard throwing right hander Paul Skenes MLB Pipeline 's No 1 overall pitching prospect Skenes could be in the Majors sometime this year and the first time he and Davis combine to form Pittsburgh 's battery could be a seminal moment\", 'link': 'https://www.mlb.com/news/players-who-could-improve-in-sophomore-season', 'author': 'Manny Randhawa', 'published_date': '2024-01-22', 'image_link': 'https://img.mlbstatic.com/mlb-images/image/upload/t_2x1/t_w1536/mlb/m5xhecwylhlzntngejms.jpg'}, {'id': '26802e0dde7c192d0c1d987b2e4924e7', 'rank': 752, 'location': 'Colorado Springs, Colorado', 'title': 'Can these 2nd half stars carry success into 24', 'excerpt': \"Getting off to a slow start may not be the end of the world but it 's not exactly ideal either No player wants to be forced to claw back from posting a sub-.200 average in April or carrying a 5.00\", 'summary': \"Getting off to a slow start may not be the end of the world but it 's not exactly ideal either No player wants to be forced to claw back from posting a sub-.200 average in April or carrying a 5.00 ERA into the All Star break nor does anyone really want the consolation prize that is having an impressive line given how poorly it started That said pretty much every player sooner or later is going to turn in an underwhelming first half and a lot of times that can turn into an underwhelming year The ones that do n't those cases where a midseason adjustment works in a player 's favor a lingering injury finally heals or their luck changes for the better are worth noting especially in the ramp up to a new season We 're there again so let 's have a look Here are nine second half stars looking to carry that momentum into 2024 Seiya Suzuki RF Cubs 1st half .748 OPS | 2nd half .938 OPS Suzuki played just 41 games for the Cubs in 2022 before he was sidelined with a sprained left ring finger that cost him more than a month He then missed most of Spring Training and the first two weeks of the 2023 season with a left oblique strain Given that it was n't hugely surprising that he did n't really find his rhythm until July You 'd hardly call Suzuki 's first half poor but he found another gear after the All Star break and only got better with time His improvements culminated in a red hot September during which he hit .370 with nine doubles two triples and seven home runs matching his first half total in 28 games Do n't be so quick to dismiss that as a small sample size either the numbers Suzuki put up in the second half look quite a lot like his career NPB numbers .315/.414/.570 .984 OPS Ke'Bryan Hayes 3B Pirates 1st half .683 OPS | 2nd half .874 OPS Hayes is already one of the best defensive third basemen in baseball has been really since he debuted in 2020 but his bat has lagged behind his glove to this point Recurring injuries have n't helped much either and his 2023 season went off course when he was placed on the injured list with back inflammation from June 28 to July 6 played one game then landed back on the IL with the same injury through Aug. 1 Abbreviated or not though Hayes second half was pretty promising No longer hampered by the back injury he had some more power behind his swing posting a 50.6 post break hard hit rate up 3.9 points from the first half and hitting 10 home runs in 49 games doubling his total of five in 75 first half games That he took home his first Gold Glove Award this past season is a big deal but keep an eye on his bat in 2024 Max Kepler RF Twins 1st half .688 OPS | 2nd half .926 OPS Kepler has spent a lot of his time in the Majors just trying to get back on the field and 2023 did n't start much better for him He was sidelined with right patellar tendinitis in April and then a left hamstring strain in May. When he was in the lineup in the first half it was pretty clear from his diminished power and uptick in strikeouts that he still did n't really have his legs under him Fortunately for both Kepler and the Twins it was really just a matter of time Plagued mainly by ground balls in the first half Kepler raised his combined line drive fly ball rate by 6.7 percentage points post break That along with the 7.6 point boost in his hard hit rate turned into the best results Kepler has ever had at the plate in the Majors In all even with the slow start he set new career highs in hard hit rate 47.9 barrel rate 12.2 xBA .271 and xSLG .503 all good signs heading into his final season before free agency Ryan Mountcastle 1B DH Orioles 1st half .691 OPS | 2nd half .893 OPS At his best Mountcastle takes his hacks He ended the 2022 season with the second highest swing rate among qualifying hitters 56.2 But through June 2023 he was working on a 57.7 swing rate and career worst 41.4 chase rate Then the Orioles placed him on the injured list because he was experiencing vertigo which went a long way toward explaining what had been going wrong Mountcastle 's season is pretty perfect for this list he got just one more first half at bat after his IL stint so his return is almost entirely captured by those excellent second half stats His chase rate was 6.1 points lower after the All Star break 35.3 It 's only one element of his game but given his power potential the increased discipline he showed late last season is huge He hit 33 home runs in his first full season in 2021 but 2024 could be the year he steps up as a centerpiece of the Orioles talented young lineup MJ Melendez OF Royals 1st half .622 OPS | 2nd half .836 OPS Melendez has punishing power he ranked in the 96th percentile of qualifying big leaguers with an average exit velocity of 93.2 mph in 2023 but he also struck out 103 times in 84 first half games in keeping with a larger career trend This is n't the case for every player on the list but Melendez 's resurgence actually does have everything to do with the All Star break which he spent in the batting cage retooling his stance to correct an issue with his timing Those adjustments helped him take a huge step forward in his development in the second half when his chase whiff and strikeout rates all dropped noticeably Melendez 's improvement with the bat is especially important given that he is now primarily an outfielder after the Royals moved him out from behind the plate early last season Jameson Taillon SP Cubs 1st half 6.15 ERA | 2nd half 3.70 ERA After an injury plagued few seasons Taillon made 29 starts in 2021 and a full 32 in 2022 He pitched well but never exactly stopped feeling like a work in progress That carried over into 2023 His first month with the Cubs during which he along with half the league was developing a sweeper was interrupted for three weeks by a left groin strain He lost his feel for his delivery and as if to add insult to injury his defense recorded -10 Outs Above Average behind him on the year ranking near the bottom of the Majors His first half FIP 4.90 definitely does n't sparkle but it 'd have been preferable to his ERA Taillon has since discussed some of the adjustments both mechanical and mental that helped him turn things around after his ERA sat near 7.00 entering his best start of the season on July 7 against the Yankees eight scoreless innings one hit He saw notable gains in his zone and whiff rates and strikeout to walk ratio after that point perhaps setting him up for a better Year 2 in Chicago Freddy Peralta SP Brewers 1st half 4.70 ERA | 2nd half 2.81 ERA This one we can probably chalk up to getting back in the groove Peralta was enjoying a breakout 2021 season when he developed inflammation in his right shoulder which recurred in 2022 Between that and a right lat strain he never really looked sharp in the 18 appearances 17 starts he did make in 2022 He came back stronger last season but he was still missing the four seamer that had defined his previous success The pitch that generated a 35.5 strikeout rate two years earlier had dipped to just 24.9 in the first half of 2023 Fortunately for him and the Brewers who rode their rotation to the postseason he just needed time to find it again His K% on four seamers was up to 41.5 after the All Star break and he notched the second most strikeouts in the second half 103 in 73 2/3 innings trailing only Spencer Strider 's 115 Most pitchers do n't need swings and misses out of their fastballs Peralta does and assuming he 's healthy his last three months of work in 2023 bode well for 2024 Robert Stephenson RP Angels 1st half 4.45 ERA | 2nd half 1.50 ERA The Rays sent Minor League infielder Alika Williams to the Pirates in exchange for a struggling Stephenson on June 2 and as they have so many times before helped a pitcher become the best version of himself Stephenson debuted with an excellent slider His problem for years has been his four seam fastball Case in point In 2023 it averaged 96.8 mph but opponents hit .300 with a .575 SLG against it Stephenson did n't entirely scrap the four seamer with Tampa Bay but Rays pitching coach Kyle Snyder helped him make some long awaited adjustments to his best pitch That worked out to put it mildly His new and improved iteration is so different it 's not actually technically even a slider anymore Given its much tighter break it 's now classified as a cutter by Statcast but Stephenson does still refer to it as his slider Whatever you want to call it it was crazy good By September he was throwing it over 70 of the time and opposing hitters never figured out what to do with it going 8 for-79 .101 with a 59.9 whiff rate against it overall That pitch is so potent that it helped him earn a three year contract from the Angels according to a report Now we 'll see if he can hang onto it with his new club Pierce Johnson RP Braves 1st half 6.49 ERA | 2nd half 0.96 ERA Johnson did spend the first half with the Rockies and calling Coors Field home definitely had something to do with his results It 's true that through July 24 when he was traded to the Braves he had a 7.23 home ERA against a 4.11 ERA on the road It 's never a bad idea to get a struggling pitcher out of Denver but there 's more to it than that With the Rockies Johnson generated a mere 28.6 ground ball rate well below the MLB average of 43.1 and issued nearly six walks per nine innings The Braves helped change his fortunes with a new gameplan and pretty straightforward advice Lean on your best pitch and pitch to contact Johnson upped his curveball usage from 53.0 in Colorado to 71.6 in Atlanta nearly doubled his groundball rate 55.8 and dramatically slashed his walk rate 1.9 BB/9 The only question now is whether he can carry that success through a full season The Braves certainly think he can re signing Johnson to a two year $ 14.25 million deal this offseason\",

otherworldly itself And despite lasers that can rob the unwary of eyesight rattlesnakes mountain lions wildfires blizzards and dizzying drops beside a twisty 19 mile access road two dozen people live and work on the scrub covered mountaintop here helping illuminate and unravel cosmic mysteries With a high pitched whirr a swath of the massive white dome containing Lick 's Shane telescope rolls up like a four story garage door to expose the giant instrument to the twilight sky Scarcely 45 minutes later resident astronomer Elinor Gates has already used light wavelength data to identify a quasar the galaxy core where gases and space dust go out in a blaze of luminous glory just before they 're sucked inside a black hole We 've made a new observation nobody 's made before Gates says in the screen filled control room beside the Shane It 's mission accomplished The Shane Dome at the Lick Observatory at Mt. Hamilton Calif. on Monday Nov. 20 2023 Nhat V. Meyer Bay Area Group Dozens more quasar hunting missions will follow on this night Gates calls herself a morning person and she 's been up since 5:30 a.m. But on this as well as on many other nights she 's a 24 hour person remaining awake till dawn analyzing data while a technician at a work station beside her points the Shane with its 10 foot wide mirror at targets in the sky that could be stars as near as 150000 light years away or quasars billions of light years distant Around 6:30 p.m. Gates guzzles the rest of a can of Coke I have some tea with me she says I need to stop drinking caffeine at 2 a.m.-ish or so to make sure I actually sleep when I finally get to The images and graphs on her screens tell Gates whether gases around an outer space object shine with color patterns like quasars or like stars Gates is researching dust shrouded quasars For each new observation she 'll later peer deep into her data to try to help answer fundamental questions about how the universe works Is being cloaked in dust a stage for a quasar Or does it happen when galaxies merge Elinor Gates right staff astronomer and Dan Espinosa mechanician chief electro mechanical technician work on finding quasars in the control room called the Shane 120 Read Out Room in the Shane Dome at the Lick Observatory at Mt. Hamilton Calif. on Monday Nov. 20 2023 Nhat V. Meyer Bay Area Group Since University of California owned Lick went operational in 1888 increasing light from the growing Bay Area metropolis below has come to interfere with astronomy Still says Andrew Fraknoi former head of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific and currently an astronomy professor at the University of San Francisco it 's a remarkable thing that being so close to San Jose and its city lights it 's still able partly because of its location and partly because of the clever people designing its instruments to do important work Much space research like Gates does not require the world 's largest telescopes or darkest nights and Lick 's array also includes the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope famed for early detection of the star explosions called supernovas Next to Gates in the control room is Dan Espinosa telescope technician and Lick 's chief mechanic How many other places do you get to use a jeweler 's screwdriver and a 15 ton crane to adjust the same instrument says Espinosa who has a mechanical engineering degree from San Jose State University and unlike morning person Gates describes himself as a natural born vampire Espinosa likes numbers He figures he climbs almost 1000 vertical feet a day on stairways around the facility 's nine operable telescopes He once tried counting all the ball bearings in the observatory machinery but gave up well into the triple digits One telescope alone the 57 foot Great Lick Refractor built in the 1880s and housed in the main building visible from much of the Bay Area has 130 ball bearings he says and every single one of them 's got to be greased As the sun begins to set chief mechanic Dan Espinosa walks on a catwalk 30 feet above ground surrounding the dome of the Shane telescope at the Lick Observatory in Mount Hamilton Calif. on Monday Nov. 20 2023 Jose Carlos Fajardo Bay Area Group On a recent afternoon Espinosa has grease on his face and hands but he 's also often tasked with putting his meaty mitts to non mechanical work beating on software to make sure it 's doing what it was designed to do Espinosa may sometimes be found in his lair a cave like office and repair shop beneath the Shane where the cool air smells of oil and grease and hulking metal work machines gleam in the fluorescent light tools of the trade for a mechanic caring for sophisticated but often aging gear On a late afternoon Espinosa is crouched outside by an open electrical box working on the cooling system for the Automated Planet Finder the world 's first robotic telescope capable of detecting rocky planets outside our solar system that might support life Espinosa holds up a length of wire extending from the box its black sheathing bearing fresh little scars This is my current little nightmare he says The mice have been at this Mice in the eastern Santa Clara County hills often mean rattlesnakes A stone 's throw from Espinosa a sign on a building warns staff and visitors to give the reptiles some respect Other placards advise people they 're in mountain lion habitat so keep children close and if attacked fight back Brush fires occur regularly on the mountain and the 2020 SCU Lightning Complex firestorm nearly took Lick out Last winter heavy snow forced technicians to trudge through deep drifts to maintain sensitive equipment while the domes stayed shut for weeks Not everyone can live up here says Gates a Lick resident for a quarter century Two other astronomers live at the observatory plus four telescope operators three technicians and other staff plus a few partners and one home schooled 7 year old making for a population of 25 In our tiny town we have neighborhoods Gates says rattling off Rattlesnake Ridge Tortilla Flats Kepler Peak and Downtown where the visitors are noisiest and homes have signs saying Quiet Please Day Sleepers inside But many who conduct research at Lick do n't have to live there Most any day students and astronomers are visiting or collaborating remotely with scientists on the mountain Scientist Eliot Young red jacket and chief mechanic Dan Espinosa return inside after touring the outside of the dome of the Shane telescope at the Lick Observatory in Mount Hamilton Calif. on Monday Nov. 20 2023 Jose Carlos Fajardo Bay Area Group On this particular day Gates is joined on the quasar search via video by Piper Walker 22 an astrophysics major at UC Santa Cruz Gates gets Walker to give target coordinates to Espinosa Computers bleep and bloop as two cameras on the telescope start and stop eight minute exposures Gates performs a preliminary analysis on the results They 're positive Walker from her Santa Cruz bedroom has helped identify her first quasar I wish I was there in person but this is still really cool Walker says She is scheduled to study at Lick in January and February Gates notes and tells her she may get to ride the dome stand on the catwalk of the Shane dome as it rotates You can watch the scenery go by Gates says Meanwhile at the Nickel telescope in the main building Eliot Young is preparing for his two minutes of truth Principal scientist at the Southwest Research Institute 's Space Studies Department in Boulder Colorado he has come to Lick for just two days to observe Uranus moon Titania as it passes briefly in front of a bright star a rare event No one knows if Titania has an atmosphere how starlight bends around it Young hopes will show him if it does Next to the door in the control room for the Nickel which is also used in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence a big red button warns LASER EMERGENCY STOP This telescope like the Shane has a powerful laser used to zap the atmosphere and make a false star reference point for canceling out atmospheric turbulence Enter the dome at the wrong time and you could be struck blind Visitors like Young can stay in on site dorms The observatory no longer has a dining hall but Young stopped on his way up to buy milk and cereal for breakfast and canned soup and baked potatoes to heat up in the kitchen Residents of the homes scattered around the domes at Lick can see Yosemite 's Half Dome on a clear day but the closest groceries are nearly an hour away in San Jose I 'm up and down the mountain at least once a week says Gates who has a boyfriend in San Mateo and performs with Lyric Theater in San Jose she 's a soprano I always look for the wildlife and the flowers Maintenance worker Billy Decaneo also appreciates the wildlife He 's seen five California condors in the past two weeks he says and a couple bald eagles were soaring over us this morning Some 35000 visitors a year make the trek to Lick 4265 feet above sea level On a recent weekday Arizonans Victor Robinson and his son Preston 7 have left a family gathering in Livermore to observe the observatory that Robinson used to visit when he lived in San Jose Preston has a telescope at home almost as tall as he is He gazes in awe through a window at the 70 foot tall Shane apparatus I wanted to come here because I really love space all the stars the galaxies and planets Preston says Meanwhile the Titania observation goes well for Colorado scientist Young Photos showed the moon blocked out the star he says and now will come detailed analysis of how the star 's light behaved It will take some careful work Young says to see if there 's a

the university took place at the front steps of Columbia 's Low Library According to Columbia University 's campus newspaper The Spectator it was there that about a dozen or so students began smelling a foul odour akin to sewage Some reported physical symptoms like nausea and burning eyes as well as damage to their personal belongings The New York Police Department NYPD confirmed that it is

the list overall saw large jumps between this year and last like Greensboro NC which moved up 25 spots and Milwaukee which jumped up 15 In better news some cities moved down the list having improved

that feed on human blood resulting in red itchy bite marks These mostly nocturnal pests are round measure about 5 millimeters long as adults and are a red to dark brown color Bedbugs can not fly but do travel efficiently clinging to clothing purses luggage bed sheets furniture and other fabric surfaces They are considered a public health pest by the Environmental Protection Agency EPA the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention CDC and the United States Department of Agriculture USDA though they are not known to carry or transmit diseases like other such pests Bedbugs are resilient and multiply quickly according to Orkin as female bed bugs can deposit up to five eggs a day and lay 200 to 500 eggs in their lifetime They can also survive several months without food but are likely to emerge the moment a food source meaning humans or animals becomes available Because they travel so well bedbugs are likely to follow you home on personal items like bags and clothes You 're most likely to pick them up from places where people sit or hang out often such as bus and train seats airplanes movie theater cushions and public furniture Once in your home they can attach to multiple fabric surfaces but are known specifically for hiding in mattresses box springs bed frames and bedding hence the name bedbugs Most people can agree that preventing bed bugs is better than treating them once they 've already taken hold in your house To avoid them the EPA suggests Check for signs of bed bugs in any secondhand or newly acquired furniture Put a protective cover on your mattress and box spring and consider getting a pretreated mattress cover Consider getting a plain light colored mattress cover and bedding to make spotting bugs easier Be extra careful in shared laundry facilities Vacuum and clean your home frequently Reduce clutter which reduces the spots bedbugs have to hide Bedbugs are often a big consideration when traveling To avoid bringing them back as unwanted souvenirs the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services suggests Put your luggage on a rack or in a dry bathtub avoid placing bags on or near the bed and other furniture Check for signs of bed bugs in the bedding along the edges and seams of mattresses box springs and bed frames Check the furniture near the bed where they could be hiding All hail the Chicago Rat Hole People leave offerings at viral rat shaped cement imprint Bedbugs can sometimes be mistaken for other insects and vice versa meaning the first step to treating them is making sure you actually have them according to the EPA Adult bed bugs are about the size of an apple seed long and brown with flat oval shaped bodies if not recently fed and balloon like reddish brown and more elongated if recently fed Young bed bugs are smaller translucent and whiteish yellow Eggs are tiny about the size of a pinhead and pearl white Rusty brownish red stains on your bedding or mattress Bedbug poop which appears as small dark spots on your mattress or other bedding Traces of tiny white eggs or eggshells Small yellowish white skins left behind after shedding A sweet musty smell Use heat by washing bedsheets clothing linens and curtains

start his upcoming testimony depending on how he 's feeling Early Monday the judge asked to see doctors affidavits before approving such an arrangement LaPierre then watched and took notes as Oliver North testified against him all day Monday A dispute over NRA leader Wayne LaPierre 's health spilled over into his New York corruption trial Monday when the judge asked that his doctors provide sworn statements attesting as his lawyers contend that he 's too ill to withstand daylong testimony I do think there should be affidavits the judge state Supreme Court Justice Joel Cohen said in court before the civil jury was bought in for the day LaPierre announced three days before the trial 's January 8 start that after 30 years at the gun lobby 's helm he will resign at the end of the month for health reasons His lawyers later revealed he has chronic Lyme disease LaPierre is expected to testify before the end of the week in the trial at which the New York attorney general 's office is alleging top executives diverted tens of millions of donor dollars into their own pockets and those of favored vendors and that the nonprofit enabled the corruption Last week LaPierre 's lawyers filed a pair of three week old letters from his doctors as proof that he struggles extensively with even the most basic tasks as an infectious disease specialist wrote and has suffered significant cerebral volume loss his internist wrote The letters dated January 3 and addressed from the doctors to NRA president Charles Cotton were submitted as proof that LaPierre is too ill to commit to all day testimony The defense asked that the gun lobby leader have the option to basically start and stop his testimony over the course of days depending on how he feels Lawyers for Attorney General Letitia James countered in a filing on Sunday that LaPierre is asking for broad and undefined relief that could be highly disruptive to the state 's case LaPierre has attended the trial regularly and continued on as NRA 's chief executive the AG 's filing noted What is more Mr. LaPierre requests this relief without providing the Court and Plaintiff with satisfactory evidence or enough warning to plan in advance for making additional witnesses available to fill in any gaps in testimony the AG 's filing added The judge agreed Monday morning that as he put it that I 'm not terribly impressed by the timing and that none of the doctors notes are signed or verified LaPierre has attended nearly every day of the two week trial missing only two out of four days of jury selection After Monday 's discussion of his health the gun lobby leader sat in the courtroom 's front row and listened to testimony against him by friend turned whistleblower Oliver North who served as president of the NRA in 2018 and 2019 LaPierre 74 watched closely taking notes on a small yellow legal pad North 80 told the jury that he and LaPierre had been close friends and that he attended the NRA leader 's 1998 wedding LaPierre OK'd a massive pay package for North $ 5 million over three years without getting the required NRA audit committee -pre approval North said But when North began asking questions about rampant spending including millions a year to a single favored law firm Brewer Attorneys Counselors LaPierre pushed him out he testified Multiple times I would tell Wayne LaPierre Brewer 's bills are astronomical North testified He would say things like Brewer is the reason why I am not going to spend the rest of my life in an orange jumpsuit North likened the in fighting over alleged financial improprieties to a circular firing squad I was not trying to pull a coup North said I was doing nothing to get Mr. LaPierre fired he said In demanding an outside audit of the NRA 's books in early 2019 he merely wanted to stop this circular firing squad North added It was incredibly damaging to us I did not want to harm the NRA North said from the witness stand At this point LaPierre still take notes began writing energetically underlining something three or four times in his notepad as his former friend spoke What I was trying to do is protect Wayne LaPierre North said The judge has not

National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum President Josh Rawitch discusses issues fans have a deep interest in', 'summary': \"Today millions of fans will tune in on television coverage begins at 4 p.m. ET on MLB Network with live announcement at 6 p.m. ET on social media and elsewhere to see who if any has been selected to enter the Baseball Hall of Fame Members of the Baseball Writers Association of America BBWAA with at least 10 years of experience covering the game are allowed to vote for the ballot that is released in November The rules given to the writers in which to make their selections spans just 23 words making the art of selection different for each individual Voting shall be based upon the player 's record playing ability integrity sportsmanship character and contributions to the team(s on which the player played Located in Cooperstown NY the mythological spot where baseball was supposed to have been born the Hall is a mecca for hundreds of thousands of fans each year More than just plaques of those inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame it is a vast museum and research facility that houses books manuscripts over 250000 photos tens of thousands of hours of video and over 40000 physical artifacts Overseeing it all is president Josh Rawitch who has held the position since 2021 Prior to the position he spent a decade with the Arizona Diamondbacks with his final six years as Senior Vice President of Content and Communications Before the D Backs he was part of the front office of the Los Angeles Dodgers for 15 years Easygoing smart and well equipped to deal with the media Rawitch is able to not only manage the Baseball Hall of Fame but talk to some of the more sensitive issues that have come with it Namely with baseball 's long past being one to work to tell baseball 's story as well as address some of those players that have not been inducted I think what we 've tried to do is just find more ways to continue to stay relevant for the next generation Rawitch said to me in an exclusive We 're going to continue to look for things like that will make the next generation of fans love the Hall of Fame How The Likes Of Pete Rose Barry Bonds And Roger Clemens Actually Are In the HOF One of the most hotly contested debates in all of sports centers on several players that had incredible playing careers but have not been inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame Pete Rose who was issued a lifetime ban from Major League Baseball for gambling on the sport is often cited So too are Barry Bonds who holds the single season and all time home run record and Roger Clemens who ranks 3 all time for Wins Above Replacement WAR for pitchers both of whom have been under the cloud of steroid use Rose remains on baseball 's ineligible list and since a rule was passed by the Hall of Fame in 1991 no player on the list is to be considered for the Hall of Fame through either a vote by the writers or committees Bonds and Clemens did not reach the requisite 75 in their 10 years on the writers ballot and failed to gain inclusion in 2022 through the Contemporary Era committee So are these players truly not in the Baseball Hall of Fame The answer is yes and no We at the Hall of Fame try to remind people all the time that there is the Plaque Gallery which has the rules for election and committees that the Hall of Fame does n't decide who goes gains inclusion there Rawitch said What we do decide is how we tell the story of baseball history And whether it 's Rose or Bonds or Clemens as well as thousands of others who are n't at the level of maybe a Hall of Fame caliber player but who contributed in some way to the game 's history Rawitch went on to say that while there are a subset of fans who think the HOF is just a hallway in a small village in upstate New York it 's much more The reality is the Baseball Hall of Fame is a three story museum that 's living and breathing and changing Using Rose as an example Rawitch said there are a considerable number of items that Rose has donated Rose 's story is told in numerous places and he was very generous with the museum in terms of artifacts he said The Issue Of What Hat An Inductee Has On Their Plaque Since the advent of free agency many of the players that are in the Plaque Gallery have played for multiple teams which can make for a difficult call on what hat a player might wear or the words on the plaque that are meant to last as long as the HOF exists Some were to address obvious corrections Roberto Clemente 's initially had his middle name and last name flopped Others may have come due to historical significance When Jackie Robinson was inducted he did not wish to have anything mentioned about his breaking of the color barrier After his death his widow Rachel suggest it be added as a significant part of his legacy In other cases it has revolved around how players may wish to be remembered with their hat While this may seem like a small matter to some it is a matter that players that are alive at the time of induction and the Hall of Fame itself grapple with constantly Jim Leyland who was voted in by the Baseball Eras Committee coached or managed with the Chicago White Sox Pittsburgh Pirates Florida Marlins where he won a World Series Colorado Rockies and Detroit Tigers At his press conference during the Baseball Winter Meetings he said that all of them meant a lot to him and only through working with the Hall would he then know what cap would win out on his plaque for eternity We work very closely with the Hall of Famer to try to understand who they 'd like to have and then ultimately try to determine whether their suggestion matches the proper historical significance of their career Rawitch said But changes players can forcefully advocate to have the hat on their plaque changed The most recent example is Andre Dawson Ultimately he worked with the Hall and I think as a group they seem to have come to a consistent consensus that they thought the Expos was where he did his most significant work Rawitch said That was before the option to have a blank hat came into play While Rawitch said that the Hall has historically looked to not change plaques unless under certain circumstances the biggest reason you 're unlikely to see plaques changed often comes down to something much more mundane Once the actual plaque is created the foundry that makes them gets rid of the mold so you really have to start from scratch Rawitch said What The Future Holds For The Baseball Hall Of Fame As the indispensable Hall of Fame Ballot Tracker run by Ryan Thibodaux shows 2024 wo n't be a year when no one gains inclusion Adrian Beltre Joe Mauer Todd Helton and possibly BillyWagner could be announced Rawitch will be on MLB Network to make the announcement today and with it this summer will have a ceremony to induct those that have garnered the requisite votes from the writers But as noted the Hall is about telling baseball 's story and this year sees a significant addition Announced during the Baseball Winter Meeting s in December Souls of the Game the Voice of Black Baseball will open Memorial Day Weekend in conjunction with the Hall 's first East West Classic a game once staged annually during the heyday of the Negro Leagues Rawitch is included in a 30 member committee that includes former Black stars CC Sabathia Dave Stewart and Josh Barfield who were in attendance for the press conference as well as Hall of Fall Fame board chairman Jane Forbes Clark and several representatives of Major League Baseball It 's been a learning experience more than just an advisory one said Stewart at the time So much about black baseball history was unknown but it shows how the game has evolved to what it is today We can be very proud of this exhibit getting it right and exposing it to the general public I found that small things really matter Coverage of the Baseball Hall of Fame class of 2024 voting begins at 4 p.m. ET on MLB Network with Rawitch announcing any players voted into the Hall at 6 p.m. ET\", 'link':

Crumbley that depicted a handgun a bullet and a bleeding figure next to the words Blood everywhere My life is useless and The thoughts wo n't stop help me Ethan told school counselors the drawings were for a video game he was designing school officials have said The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home prosecutors have said The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing prosecutors say This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter 's parents had n't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the

feels awesome for the sale to hit that milestone I feel like the show has really had more interest this year than ever before Schweger said Schweger 's mom Marj Sater is the founder of the Super Duper Garage Sale After Sater died in 2020 Schweger took up the mantle to keep the sale going She came up with this idea as a way for the average person to sell their items and not have to wait for summer to have a garage sale Schweger said of her mom It just gives people an opportunity to sell their stuff and for shoppers to find treasures This year 's Super Duper Garage Sale included 102 vendors which Schweger said is on par with the years before the COVID-19 pandemic She also estimated a couple thousand visitors attending the sale between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday Schweger said many of the shoppers are repeat customers around 100 people even showed up at 8 a.m. for an hour of early shopping before doors opened to the public A lot of people look forward to this event every year Schweger said It 's really exciting My mom she loved this event It 's amazing to see people love it so much too Schweger explained that while some of the vendors are professional dealers others are simply locals hoping to move some items out of storage The result is booth upon booth of antiques and one of a kind items all under one roof There really is n't any other event like this she said It 's so big and you do n't know what you 're going to find There 's some of everything here Some of everything is a fitting description of this year 's sale A walk through the vendor booths reveals the unique taste of each seller whether that 's boxes of old vinyl records a collection of Vans sneakers or a table full of Elvis Presley memorabilia Boulder vendor Julie Crofford who has been selling at the event for 20 years called the sale a good opportunity for dealers to organize their inventory and learn what buyers are interested in It 's really a good service for our community and for the community of dealers Crofford said Melissa Durovich from Louisville has spent roughly a decade selling at the Super Duper Garage Sale featuring handcrafted items like textiles and rugs With the way things have changed so much with the internet to have a show like this that has lasted 30 years speaks volumes Durovich said Through face to face shopping you get to meet the customers what they 're

through protected Utah woodlands stopping a large scale crude oil conveyance project in its tracks The 12 mile segment which would have run through northeastern Utah 's Ashley National Forest was a key component of the proposed Uinta Basin Railway an 88 mile stretch of rail that would run alongside the Colorado River The project would serve to connect Utah fossil fuel producers to the larger national railway network and ultimately enable these sites to sell their resources to Gulf of Mexico refineries But officials across the border in Colorado as well as environmental groups have long lambasted the plan citing potential risks of catastrophic oil spills adjacent to a river that serves as the lifeblood of the U.S. West The Forest Service 's withdrawal of its approval follows an August U.S. Court of Appeals decision that overturned the project 's authorization and deemed its required environmental impact statement EIS in violation of the National Environmental Policy Act NEPA That authorization as well as the problematic EIS were the products of the Surface Transportation Board an independent federal entity that regulates certain railroad issues The August ruling which occurred in response to a petition filed by Eagle County Colo. and local organizations determined that the EIS violated NEPA protocols from several angles The decision cited deficiencies in quantifying foreseeable upstream and downstream impacts on vegetation and in accounting for oil refining impacts on Gulf Coast environmental justice communities The EIS also did not take a hard look at wildfire risk as well as impacts on water resources downline while additionally failing to provide sufficient information on local accident risk per the ruling Utah 's Seven County Infrastructure Coalition a public interlocal partner in the rail project petitioned the August ruling but the court in December declined a rehearing on the subject Susan Eickhoff supervisor of Ashley National Forest attributed the Forest Service 's decision to revoke its approval to the fact that the court had vacated both the EIS and a biological opinion prepared by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service If the deficiencies are addressed and resubmitted for consideration the Forest Service may issue a new decision Eickhoff wrote The withdrawal was met with widespread enthusiasm among the environmental organizations and politicians who had spearheaded the fight against the railroad Two Colorado Democrats Sen. Michael Bennet and Rep. Joe Neguse applauded the decision as a pivotal move toward protecting the Colorado River and those who depend upon it A derailment along the headwaters of the Colorado River could have catastrophic effects for Colorado 's communities water and environment Bennet said in a statement Neguse meanwhile described the Forest Service 's decision as instrumental in avoiding the dangers that accompany this project The withdrawal he explained serves to help Coloradans preserve the state 's water supplies wildlife habitat outdoor recreation assets and the broader River Basin Ingrid Wussow mayor of the nearby city of Glenwood Springs emphasized the importance of preventing this potentially devastating project from moving forward This project had the potential of creating an environmental disaster that would have impacted the water source for over 40 million Americans she added\", 'link': 'https://news.yahoo.com/forest-nixes-permit-allowed-colorado-201313799.html', 'author': 'Sharon Udasin', 'published_date': '2024-01-22', 'image_link': 'https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_hill_articles_341/0d34b19173dea1d6b5a68041a7d79c9b'}, {'id': '3e630e3b032082d3db5d2f946b6dd59b', 'rank': 31, 'location': 'Colorado Springs, Colorado', 'title': 'UI football starts to take shape ahead of 24 season', 'excerpt': 'Jan. 24 Idaho football coach Jason Eck continued to bolster his staff and roster over the last couple of days The Vandals signed two new position coaches on Tuesday Deontae Cooper running backs', 'summary': \"Jan. 24 Idaho football coach Jason Eck continued to bolster his staff and roster over the last couple of days The Vandals signed two new position coaches on Tuesday Deontae Cooper running backs and Hunter Hughes will lead the Sams outside linebackers and Nickels cornerbacks Idaho also promoted several members from within its staff including tight ends coach Tyler Sutton who will now also coordinate the special teams unit Receivers coach Matt Linehan and defensive line coach David Lose added recruiting coordinator and edge coach respectively to their resumes And last Friday the Vandals signed nine new players seven of whom were transfers Here 's a look at UI 's additions over the last couple of days Hughes brings much experience Hughes comes to Moscow after spending one season as the defensive backs and quality control coach for the New Orleans Breakers of the USFL The Nashville native helped lead the Breakers to a 7 3 overall record good enough for a second place finish in the South division Before New Oreleans Hughes spent six seasons as the headman at West Texas A&M DII where he compiled a 32 29 record His best finish as a head coach came in 2021 when the Buffs finished 7 4 overall and 5 2 in Lone Star Conference play 16 players earned all conference honors for West Texas A&M in 2021 and freshman linebacker JT Cavender was labeled the conference 's linebacker and freshman of the year Before leading the Buffs Hughes spent a decade coordinating the Colorado State Pueblo defense While leading the Thunderwolves he was named defensive coordinator of the year from within the Division II ranks by FootballScoop in 2011 In 2011 Colorado State Pueblo led all of Division II in scoring defense 12.8 points per game passes intercepted 29 defensive touchdowns 7 and turnovers 43 He also led CSUP to a 13 0 victory over Minnesota State Mankato in the 2014 championship game Hughes began his college coaching career as a graduate assistant at Colorado in 2003 where he worked alongside Eck I am thrilled to join the staff here at Idaho and be a part of this special team that coach Eck has assembled Hughes said in a news release I have known coach Eck for over two decades and jumped at the opportunity to work with him again What he and his staff have done here in just two seasons is impressive and I 'm excited to be a part of building a great program here in Moscow Cooper is set to take on a new crop of backs Cooper will have the opportunity to coach and elevate an inexperienced running backs room for Idaho The Perris Calif. native comes to Moscow after a five year stint as the headman at Highline High School in Burien Wash.

that was mentally emotionally and physically exhausting Teresa Mendoza met her daughter Then just one day after her due date the baby died Sylvia was my first pregnancy the Washington based nurse tells TODAY.com adding that her pregnancy was routine I had an appointment the day after her due date and it was there that we learned she had died unexpectedly of course and unexplained She had dark hair long fingers and big feet we like to think she would have been a dancer Mendoza recalls Our families were able to be there meet and hold her celebrate her existence and grieve her death until we said goodbye This was not Mendoza 's last pregnancy though When she last spoke with TODAY.com she was pregnant with her fourth child her rainbow baby Related The rainbow after the storm is joyous but anything but simple Psychologist Dr. Jessica Zucker author of I Had a Miscarriage A Memoir A Movement tells TODAY.com that people generally refer to a baby born after a pregnancy loss infant death stillbirth or miscarriage as a rainbow baby In fact Zucker has a rainbow baby of her own Similarly the American Pregnancy Association defines rainbow baby as symbolizing hope healing and something beautiful after a dark and turbulent time This is much like the rainbow 's symbol of promise and light There is even a Rainbow Baby Day Aug. 22 Mendoza explains the storm and rainbow reference might not be the best imagery to describe the loss of a pregnancy or baby Referring to anything with her as darkness or a storm felt like it focused strictly on her death rather than her very real life she shares Pregnancy and infant loss is already so very stigmatized and shrouded in families feeling isolated and pressured to move on she says My kids are siblings One of them is dead and others are alive I do n't feel the need to call their existence anything other than they are their sister 's brothers and she is their sister Referring to anything with her as darkness or a storm felt like it focused strictly on her death rather than her very real life Meg Konig a photographer and mom in Colorado first heard the term shortly before she miscarried her daughter Hope When she delivered her son Everett after her loss Konig says she was n't in love with the idea of calling her newborn a rainbow baby partly because she does n't want to define Everett in relation to Hope For me the term aligned with the idea that we would n't have tried for another baby if we had had a successful birth with our previous pregnancy Konig says It 's been many years since our miscarriage but when I think of losing Hope and then of having our son Everett I think of it as two separate events Konig published her thoughts in an essay on the Colorado Springs Moms Collective and discovered she was not alone in her discomfort with the term Her baby Hope was not a kind of tumultuous event that we had to overcome Konig wrote She was n't the storm We want to remember her herself as the rainbow Related As she tells the story my mom is sobbing a deep guttural cry Something I have n't really seen from her ever The mom of four echoed Mendoza 's feeling that there 's pressure to get over or move on from a loss Storms pass and then a rainbow appears Loss does n't clear up like a storm does Loss can not be compared or measured My loss with Hope was deeply impacting and I had to work through it for a very long time she says The timeline for grief varies by each person and there was no grand rule book or timeline for bereavement Zucker attempts to clarify the potentially problematic phrasing noting that it might be helpful to step back and look at the phrase more broadly saying Many women think My loss is not a storm how dare we talk in contrast seeing the loss as a storm She tries to reassure them by saying Of course your baby is not a storm but the situation may cause tumult in your life and that 's what the storm is referring to Both Mendoza and Konig mention the importance of recognizing their emotions A tremendous amount of healing and connection is possible in sitting with sadness acknowledging it and working through it Mendoza says There will always be someone missing and the profound longing and sadness I feel from that are OK emotions to carry Some things do n't need a positive spin This article was originally published on TODAY.com\", 'link':
