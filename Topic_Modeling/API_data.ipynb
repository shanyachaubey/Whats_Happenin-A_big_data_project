      "            \"summary\": \"Jan. 29\\u2014For the first time in more than two decades, Folsom Field will see new concert acts outside of Dead & Company this summer, including its first electronic music group.\\n\\\"It's going to be awesome. It's going to be a great production and a lot of fun,\\\" Ryan Gottlieb, University of Colorado Boulder senior associate athletic director said, adding, \\\"It's really cool to have shows with modern music that has a young audience and young fanbase.\\\"\\nIn October, CU Boulder announced singer Tyler Childers will be performing at Folsom Field on Aug. 17, whose music is a mix of country, bluegrass and folk. On Monday, the university announced the electronic group Odesza will perform on June 29. It will be the first electronic music concert ever held at Folsom.\\n\\\"I think these shows are going to bring a new and unique vibe to Folsom and Boulder and they should both perform extraordinarily well,\\\" Gottlieb said.\\nDon Strasburg, co-president of AEG Presents Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, has been working with CU Boulder to find other concerts and opportunities after Dead & Co. had their last shows at Folsom in July.\\n\\\"I'm really pumped,\\\" Strasburg said. \\\"This year, having two new artists that AEG Presents is bringing to the community, Odesza and Tyler Childers, are showing that there is a larger scope and breadth of entertainment that fits in Folsom Field and in Boulder.\\\"\\nOdesza will be the first new act at Folsom since Dead & Co. started performing there in 2016. Before 2016, there was a 15-year period where no concerts were held at Folsom Field. However, the venue has a legacy of hosting some big-name musicians and bands, especially during the '70s and '80s, with concerts from acts like Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney.\\nAfter Dead & Co. held its final shows at Folsom in July, CU Boulder said it sought to continue concerts by seeking new acts.\\n\\\"We knew we would have to be creative to find some new stuff,\\\" Gottlieb said.\\nGottlieb said CU Boulder hopes to host anywhere from two to four or five shows a year. The university does profit from hosting concerts, and the revenue goes toward supporting a variety of departments on campus, including athletics, the CU Boulder Police Department, parking services and facilities management.\\nCU Boulder wants to program multiple summer events in the stadium, Gottlieb said, because of the impact on the university and the Boulder community, including hotels, restaurants and retail shops.\\n\\\"Those groups just see such a massive lift when there's a concert,\\\" he said. \\\"It's great for us and it's great for the community.\\\"\\nThe Visit Boulder Convention and Visitors Bureau conducted an economic impact report for the final three Dead & Co. shows. A $31 million direct impact was calculated, in addition to a $48 million total impact.\\nThe direct economic impact includes direct spending by visitors, organizers, media and sponsors for purchases related to lodging, transportation, food and drink, retail and recreation. The total impact represents the indirect additional spending by local businesses and by employees through generated income. It also includes the spending that leaks outside of the local economy, due to the purchase of goods, services and raw materials by locals and event organizers.\\nThose calculations were run knowing that 44,000 people attended day one and two and 38,000 attended day three.\\n\\\"Bringing large-scale events to Boulder brings a vitality that permeates all the aspects of the community,\\\" Strasburg said. \\\"And that vitality is ephemeral in the sense that it makes for fun things to do in the community, but it's also financial because a lot of people come to the concert and spend money.\\\"\\nJohn Tayer, president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber, said the chamber is looking forward to making sure the concerts are a positive experience for visitors, residents and businesses.\\n\\\"We love the diversity of entertainment that CU is attracting to our community and the audiences that we enjoy welcoming to our restaurants, retail and hotel venues,\\\" Tayer said.\\nTickets for Tyler Childers are available online. Presales for Odesza start at 10 a.m. Wednesday and general sales start at 10 a.m. Friday. For more information or tickets, visit tinyurl.com/yz7tk2fr.\\n\\\"Folsom field is special, Boulder is special, and we can't wait to spend more time there this summer,\\\" Strasburg said.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Ahead of Colorado football's first season back in the Big 12 Conference, the Buffs' 2024 schedule was announced on Tuesday. CU's slate features three intriguing nonconference games, six total home dates and an East Coast road trip.\\nAfter leading the Buffs to four wins in 2023, head coach Deion Sanders has landed over 20 transfer portal players so far this offseason, including a slew of experienced offensive and defensive linemen.\\nCoach Prime's roster reboot isn't complete just yet, but the Buffs have improved at several key positions. Starting quarterback Shedeur Sanders, two-way star Travis Hunter and several other big names are also set to return.\\nTake a closer game-by-game look at Colorado's 2024 schedule:\\nLocation:\\u00a0Folsom Field (Boulder, CO)\\nSeries Record:\\u00a0Never met\\nNorth Dakota State's 2023 Record: 11-4 (5-3 Missouri Valley)\\nWhether or not you believe in 'trap games,' Colorado can't afford to overlook this matchup. North Dakota State has been a premier Football Championship Subdivision team in recent years that will be looking to spoil the Buffs' season opener.\\nLocation:\\u00a0Memorial Stadium (Lincoln, NE)\\nSeries Record:\\u00a0Nebraska leads, 49-21-2\\nNebraska's 2023 Record:\\u00a05-7 (3-6 Big Ten)\\nLast season's battle between first-year head coaches Deion Sanders and Matt Rhule was great entertainment and Colorado's 2024 matchup against rival Nebraska should be even better. The Buffs will be looking for their fourth straight win over the Cornhuskers.\\nLocation:\\u00a0Canvas Stadium (Fort Collins, CO)\\nSeries Record:\\u00a0Colorado leads, 68-22-2\\nColorado State's 2023 Record:\\u00a05-7 (3-5 Mountain West)\\nThe Rocky Mountain Showdown will be played in Fort Collins for the first time since 1996.

The AI turned up 130,000 images of rocks with compelling features, half of which the researchers reviewed. Their research is published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'Normally, lunar dust is very porous and reflects a lot of light back in the direction of illumination,' said Marcel Hess, a researcher at TU Dortmund University and co-author of the study, in the release. 'However, when the dust is compacted, the overall brightness usually increases. This is not the case with the observed dust-covered rocks.'\\nSo what the heck is going on with this dust? The team isn't quite sure, but the Lunar Vertex mission may have answers. The solar-powered lander is slated to explore over 1.2 miles of the Reiner Gamma region, where it will sample some of the magnetic properties on the lunar surface. If the lander focuses on the photometric behavior of the dust, the team wrote, it may clarify why the dust appears different to other lunar dust, in turn potentially revealing details of the Moon's formation or impact history.\\nMore: Fate of Japan's History-Making \\u2018Lunar Sniper' in Doubt After Power Malfunction\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSign up for Gizmodo's letter.

This decline in bee populations has prompted scientists and environmentalists to petition for Colorado's pollinator species to get federal protection under the Endangered Species Act, according to a Jan. 25 press release.\\nThis extensive new report shows in detail how pollinators are crucially important to the ecosystem, and affect many aspects of human life from food production to tourism. For example, industrious squash bees, native to Colorado, work behind the scenes to pollinate cantaloupe blossoms, making them a key part of the production of the famous Rocky Ford Cantaloupes.\\n'Our native bees have co-evolved with our native plants. We recreate in our beautiful high alpine mountains because they are covered in colorful wildflowers, which wouldn't be there if they didn't have our native pollinators to help them reproduce. Additionally, those native plants are integral to our rangelands, supporting over $5 billion worth of livestock across the state,' said Adrian Carper, an entomologist in the Department of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at CU Boulder and the CU Museum of Natural History.\\nThe report said that Colorado's pollinator population has decreased by more than half in the last 35 years. And, Carper pointed out, this is only for the species we have good data for.\\n'That's a huge alarm call,' he said.\\nThis page from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's website has more information on how and why pollinators are important to human life. They also provide a list of pollinator-friendly practices to help bees thrive.\\nBut you may be wondering, is there anything you can do to support local bumblebees and other pollinators? Planting native plants in your backyard is one important way, says Carper.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Feb. 4\\u2014Among the honors given out last December by the American Institute of Architects Santa Fe chapter as part of its AIA 2023 Design Awards, the one that went to what was essentially the best house was the Commendation Award for the Maul/Harnar Residence. The architect was Michael Krupnick of Santa Fe's Krupnick Studio Architecture. But as the refreshingly self-effacing Krupnick would be the first to point out\\u2014and did\\u2014the owner of the house, Jeff Maul (who also founded and owns Santa Fe Awning) came to Krupnick and said, I have a dream. Can you help me? \\\"I was like, Absolutely,\\\" recalls Krupnick, who's about to leave for a monthlong recharge in Bali (with one of his current clients, the sculptor Kevin Box). \\\"I love creative clients.\\\"\\nMaul, who's partners with Lori Harnar, the widow of the late legendary New Mexico architect Jeff Harnar (whose most renowned public buildings would be the Jean Cocteau Cinema and the Santa Fe Children's Museum), wanted an \\\"aging-in-place version\\\" of the [Jeff Harnar-designed] house he'd been in\\u2014which was at the top of a mountain and had about 350 steps from the driveway to the front door, far enough away that it had a tram (for transporting beer and furniture). I'm getting old, Maul had said. I can't walk that far every day for the rest of my life. I need a grownup version of the house I've lived in the past 30 years. A Harnar house. This is that house\\u2014but the 2.0 version.\\n\\\"I tap into the energy of my clients and we go back and forth,\\\" says Krupnick of his process, who cut his architectural teeth in Florida and Arizona before setting up his own studio in Santa Fe in 1995. \\\"I call myself a co-designer. Jeff and I co-designed his space. But it's always my client's vision. I help them art direct and guide them toward the final product.\\\"\\nMaul knew what he wanted: steel and glass. And then more steel and glass. Western-facing glass. With a dining room table that's suspended from the ceiling by a steel cable\\u2014so it sways. Like a sailboat. Like a glass-and-steel sailboat coming out of the side of the mountain.\\nStarted a year before the pandemic lockdown and finished in 2023 (though Haul will likely be tinkering with it forever), when he was ready to move in Maul marveled to Krupnick, I can't believe I built this thing. It's so beautiful. \\\"That's my job is to take his vision and his skill and his talents and make it beautiful and functional,\\\" says Krupnick. \\\"Jeff was taking a giant risk. We didn't know if it was gonna work. We went on the adventure together. And it did work.\\\"\\nLooking very much like a high-desert Neutra house, Krupnick sees it as integrated very much with the land and nature. And reflective of New Mexican culture. \\\"My favorite art form in New Mexico is the low rider. And this is definitely a low rider of the architecture world.\\\"\\nKrupnick doesn't really work for awards or fame. In most ways, though, he embodies what the AIA Santa Fe is all about: community and communalism. As its executive director Tom Spray said, \\\"I believe the community would be interested in these awards because architects help to shape our surroundings, and as we navigate our daily lives, much of what we see is a result of their creativity. People naturally want to know what's happening in their community, especially when it comes to seeing the best work in the Santa Fe area that has been recognized by a jury of professionals.\\\"\\nThe judges praised the Maul/Harnar house thusly: \\\"This project stood out from other residential entries. ... It reads as a multigenerational experiment in difficult sites, ethereal structures with experiential doors and furniture. The jury was intrigued to understand how, rather than imposing style or preferences, the architect served as a medium for the owners to tell the story and pay homage to Jeff Harnar, one of New Mexico's originals. ... The collaboration of Owner, Artist, and Architect succeeds in execution of an 'idea.' \\\"\\nPeople often ask Krupnick who his favorite architect is and he tells them: Miles Davis (despite citing a background working under Scottsdale, Arizona's \\\"Boulder House\\\" architect Charles Johnson\\u2014\\\"I learned how to be kind of fearless and organic by working with him\\\"\\u2014who worked under Richard Neutra, who worked under Frank Lloyd Wright). \\\"I like the jazz approach to architecture,\\\" says Krupnick, who's not at all ashamed to add he does everything from \\\"high rises to chicken coops.\\\"\\nHe loves adobe, and mixes it as much as he can with contemporary modernist theory and design. Along with what he'd learned from his wife, alongside whom he's worked half his career. \\\"I honestly learned how to design with a feminine touch by working with her,\\\" says Krupnick. Her influence came in the form of the lime plaster on the walls, \\\"that really softened it up. And we brought the outside in\\u2014we put boulders in the living room.\\\" A very Harnaresque touch.\\nAside from his Bali retreat with Box and the 20 or so other projects he always has going, he's working on a transitional living center in Espa\\u00f1ola for drug rehab (converting an old motel into an Austin-style boutique hotel for people in recovery) and a container village food truck complex in Ohkay Owingeh for a Native food-truck group.\\nThough some saw Maul as difficult, Krupnick saw a bit of a soulmate. \\\"He wakes up every day ready to see what the world has to offer.\\\"\\nTo see all of 2023's Design winners, go to: www.aiasantafe.org/2023designawards.\\nSaguna Severson graduated with a BA in Architecture from the University of California, Berkeley, College of Environmental Design. After going off to study architecture in Japan, she moved to Santa Fe and has never looked back. Working first for Santa Fe architects, she then went for an MA in Counseling Psychology, and is now the Marketing Director at Zachary and Sons Homes at: zacharyandsons.com\",\n",

'We have this 30-year history of working on the scientific stuff but then turning it into solutions and working with partners to get it implemented into scale.\\n'In a broad sense, that's what they're trying to do with this engines program.'\\nA key component of the program, he added, is its plan to develop the workforce necessary to implement solutions.\\n'We're looking at building an industry that hardly exists,' Willson said. 'How do we do that in a way that benefits not just our students at the research universities, but also other sectors of the economies of Colorado and Wyoming?'\\nInnosphere Ventures will lead the CO-WY Engine, spokespeople for multiple project participants said. The extensive partnership also includes six other universities in Colorado; the University of Wyoming and its High Plains American Indian Research Institute; the community college systems of both Colorado and Wyoming; five federal laboratories; three regional economic development and business councils; the cities of Fort Collins, Boulder, Greeley, Denver and Cheyenne, Wyoming; eight industry partners; and a number of other entities.\\n\\n'The CO-WY Engine will be instrumental in bringing technology-driven solutions to life, growing our two-state economy and reshaping our region's and nation's ability to become more climate resilient,' said Mike Freeman, CEO of Innosphere Ventures, in a news release. 'In 10 years, the CO-WY Engine will generate significant economic impact for our region, including 22,000 new climate technology-related jobs, $1.5 billion in regional GDP impact, more than $1 billion in private capital formation, train or reskill more than 2,000 individuals, and distribute $80 million in commercialization grants to startups in the climate technology sector.'\\nCSU played 'a key role in developing the proposal and the concept,' Willson said. 'It takes advantage of the great expertise in Colorado,' noting the satellite measurements taken by Lockheed Martin and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to the on-the-ground monitoring of methane emissions performed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology.\\nProjects under the CO-WY Engine umbrella could include wildfire mitigation, water resource management, soil carbon capture, earth sensing, methane, sustainable agriculture and adaptation to extreme weather events, officials said.\\n'How do we do improved measurements, analysis and prediction to increase the value of interventions related to climate and community resiliency,' Willson said.\\n\\nThe commercialization of these new technologies by the collaborators will result in economic growth and job creation, Innosphere Ventures said in its news release, by supporting the growth of existing businesses, the emergence of new startups and attracting outside investment.\\n'This economic boost is expected to transcend traditional industry boundaries, creating new opportunities in sectors directly and indirectly related to climate technology,' the news release reads.\\nThe universities of Colorado and Wyoming will also take leadership in various areas of the CO-WY Engine, based on the strengths of their specific research and innovation, said Cassandra Moseley, CSU's new vice president for research.\\nOne of the biggest strengths of the CO-WY Engine, she said, is the number of participants, each bringing their unique expertise to the table.\\n'Science is always a team sport,' Moseley said. 'Innovative science in the climate world has got to be a team sport. People thinking really big, building on strengths through these partnerships are going to be able to do a lot more than any of us can do individually.'\\nReporter Kelly Lyell covers education, breaking news, some sports and other topics of interest for the Coloradoan.

Over billions of years, the surface has been hit by asteroids and comets, with the resulting angular fragments constantly getting ejected from the impacts,' Nicholas Schmerr, another author of the study, said.\\n'As a result, the reworked surface material can be micron-sized to boulder-sized, but all very loosely consolidated. Loose sediments make it very possible for shaking and landslides to occur,' Dr Schmerr explained.\\nNasa hopes to launch its first crewed flight to the moon in more than five decades as part of the Artemis missions in late 2024. With plans evolving to ultimately establish a long-term presence on the lunar surface, researchers hope to scope out the Moon further to identify more locations that may be dangerous for human exploration.\\n'This work is helping us prepare for what awaits us on the Moon \\u2013 whether that's engineering structures that can better withstand lunar seismic activity or protecting people from really dangerous zones,' Dr Schmerr said.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Earth's moon is a constant in the night sky, following predictable phases in its orbit. However, its size likely has been changing over time. A study published January 25 in the Planetary Science Journal found that the moon has shrunk more than 150 feet in circumference as its core gradually cooled over the past few hundred million years.\\n[Related: The moon is 40 million years older than we thought, according to crystals collected by Apollo astronauts.]\\nA team of scientists from NASA, the Smithsonian, Arizona State University, and The University of Maryland discovered evidence that the continuing shrinkage led to some surface changes around the Lunar South Pole. The terrain has even changed in areas where NASA hopes to land during the crewed Artemis III mission.\\nThis lunar shrinking process looks similar to how a grape wrinkles when it becomes a raisin. The moon also wrinkles and creases as it shrinks down. However, a grape has a flexible skin, while the moon has a brittle surface. The brittleness causes faults to form where sections of the crust push up against each other.\\nThe fault formation caused by this continued shrinking often comes with seismic activity like moonquakes. Any locations near these moon fault zones could pose a threat to human exploration there, the same way that those living near fault lines on Earth face a greater risk of earthquakes.\\nIn the new study, the team linked a group of faults in the moon's south polar region to a powerful moonquake recorded by Apollo seismometers over 50 years ago. They used computer models to simulate the stability of surface slopes here and found that some areas in particular were vulnerable to lunar landslides from the seismic activity.\\n'Our modeling suggests that shallow moonquakes capable of producing strong ground shaking in the south polar region are possible from slip events on existing faults or the formation of new thrust faults,' Thomas R. Watters, study co-author and senior scientist emeritus in the National Air and Space Museum, said in a statement. 'The global distribution of young thrust faults, their potential to be active and the potential to form new thrust faults from ongoing global contraction should be considered when planning the location and stability of permanent outposts on the moon.'\\nShallow moonquakes occur only about 100 or so miles deep into the moon's crust. They are caused by faults and can be strong enough to damage equipment and human-made structures. Earthquakes tend to last for only a few seconds or minutes at most. Shallow moonquakes can last for hours and even a whole afternoon. The team connected the magnitude 5 moonquake recorded by the Apollo Passive Seismic Network in the 1970s\\u00a0 to a group of faults detected by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter more recently. This means that this seismic activity could devastate any future hypothetical settlements on the moon.\\n[Related: 10 incredible lunar missions that paved the way for Artemis.]\\n'You can think of the moon's surface as being dry, grounded gravel and dust. Over billions of years, the surface has been hit by asteroids and comets, with the resulting angular fragments constantly getting ejected from the impacts,' study co-author and University of Maryland geologist Nicholas Schmerr, said in a statement. 'As a result, the reworked surface material can be micron-sized to boulder-sized, but all very loosely consolidated. Loose sediments make it very possible for shaking and landslides to occur.'\\nThe team will continue to map out this seismic activity on the moon, hoping to pinpoint more locations that could be dangerous for human exploration. NASA's Artemis missions are currently scheduled to launch their first crewed flight in September 2025, with a crewed moon landing scheduled for September 2026. One of the ultimate goals of these future missions is a long-term human presence on the moon.\\n'As we get closer to the crewed Artemis mission's launch date, it's important to keep our astronauts, our equipment and infrastructure as safe as possible,' Schmerr said. 'This work is helping us prepare for what awaits us on the moon\\u2014whether that's engineering structures that can better withstand lunar seismic activity or protecting people from really dangerous zones.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Ask any travel expert why they got into the business, and they'll likely be quick to shout out a specific destination that stole their heart. Maybe it was the incredible food, the lively arts scene, or the picturesque views that won them over and made them think, I'd like to do this for a living.\\nWhile the options are seemingly endless, especially for people who do it for a living, everyone secretly has that one spot that trumps the rest. We asked six travel experts to weigh in on the places that made them fall in love with travel.\\nHere's what they said:\\nSarah Marston Crocker, the founder and owner of\\u00a0Pathways Active Travel\\u00a0in Boulder, Colorado, grew up hiking hut to hut in the Swiss Alps with her family. But it wasn't until 2016, when she was between jobs, that a trip to Northern Italy propelled her into the travel industry.\\nThe idea for her active travel company was born on a rocky, rugged hiking trail, the Alta Via 2, in the heart of the Dolomites, a mountain range in the northern Italian Alps.\\n'We had just ascended up to the highest point on the Alta Via 2 and were enjoying a nice gentle traverse while taking in the panorama as we made our way towards Passo Pordoi and closer views of the Marmolada Glacier,' Crocker told HuffPost.\\nNext, Crocker visited Madonna di Campiglio, a small ski town, and was blown away by how beautiful and accessible this area of the Dolomites was. The visit solidified her desire to create Pathways and share this type of memorable hiking experience with others.\\n'I fell in love with this place and these mountains \\u2014 and with the friendly, warm people, the culture and the incredible food,' she said.\\nEmma Lasiuk\\u00a0visited Costa Rica in her junior year of college to volunteer near Manuel Antonio. She fell in love with the country's lush green fauna, deep blue sea and pink and orange sunsets. The local people, or 'Ticos' as they proudly call themselves, won her heart next.\\n'I had traveled extensively before visiting here but had never felt so warmly welcomed and safe,' said Lasiuk, now a travel consultant with Costa Rican Vacations. She embraced the Pura Vida lifestyle, filling her days with hikes, early-morning beach swims and wildlife spotting.\\nWhen it was time to return to the United States, she was terrified that Costa Rica would fade to a memory \\u2014 so much so that she instantly booked another trip and eventually moved there full-time.\\n'There is something for everyone in Costa Rica, whether it be zip lining above the treetops in La Fortuna, swaying on hanging bridges in the dense cloud forest of Monteverde, jumping off waterfalls in the deep jungles of Manuel Antonio or diving off the Central Pacific coast at Ca\\u00f1o Island,' she said. 'I cannot see myself living anywhere else.'\\nMadison Ned Butler, communications manager with the Rail Passengers Association, has seen most of the country through their long-distance train travels, but one destination in the South stood out.\\n'Mississippi is beautiful, complicated, joyous, bold and friendly,' they told HuffPost. In 2019, Butler spent a week and a half traversing the Gulf Coast and exploring the Delta, in awe of the state's culture and communities.\\n'The food, music, and art scenes are phenomenal right now. I've seen brilliant emerging talent from the state that has already produced many of our most acclaimed artists,' Butler said.\\nPerhaps their favorite part was visiting the various historical sites and museums, including the Mississippi Freedom Trail\\u00a0and the\\u00a0Civil Rights Museum in nearby Memphis, Tennessee.\\n'There is a feeling of hopeful change with a recognition of history's tragedies that I think is very conscious and beautiful,' Butler said. 'I think everyone that lives in the U.S. should visit these sites and take that history in for themselves.'\\nIn 2006,\\u00a0Stephanie Chastain\\u00a0and her husband were looking for a destination for their honeymoon. Chastain had never traveled internationally. They chose Ireland because they'd heard great things about the scenery and history.\\nChastain, now the founder of Infinite Ireland Travel Co., told HuffPost she\\u00a0'was a goner' from the moment she stepped off the plane. She was most looking forward to the iconic sites like the Cliffs of Moher and Killarney National Park \\u2015 and while they were spectacular, it was the people and the local sites that wound up being the most memorable for her.\\nShe and her husband spent their days weaving though mom-and-pop shops, visiting old, tiny pubs, and stumbling on hidden gems that weren't in their guidebooks, such as the 300 A.D. stone fort sitting in the middle of a farmer's field.\\nAfter that trip, and a few return visits, Chastain decided to help others experience authentic, local Ireland. People who travel to Ireland often try to zip around to all the iconic sites; Chastain encourages people to go at a slower pace so they have time to meet the local people, meander through lesser-known spots, and leave room for adventure.\\nNick Kembel, a travel photographer and writer, first visited Taiwan because he was curious to learn about a new destination. He immediately felt welcomed \\u2014 he said locals help people navigate around and provide tips on cheap eats.\\n'They'll insist you try their grandma's secret soup dumplings, or point you toward hidden night market stalls that only locals know about,' Kembel said.\\nWhat sealed the deal for him, though, was the nature. 'From the peaceful Sun Moon Lake to the dramatic Taroko Gorge, every landscape told stories, and hiking was seeing more magic,' Kembel said.\\nYears ago, Jim Pattiz, a nature filmmaker and co-founder of the organization More Than Just Parks, took a spur-of-the-moment summer road trip from his home in Atlanta to the Grand Canyon. It ended up changing the course of his life. Pattiz and his crew borrowed his grandmother's Prius and drove straight through to New Mexico, followed by a visit to Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona.\\n'Having grown up in Georgia, all I knew were woods and streams, but here you could see beautiful summer storms rolling in miles and miles off in the distance,' Pattiz told HuffPost.\\nHe recalls the blue mesas, the striped hills and, of course, the petrified wood. The vastness of it all awakened his senses, he says, and everything suddenly seemed so exciting and possible.\\n'That feeling of enchantment and wide open possibilities is one I've chased ever since in my travels all across America's public lands,' he said.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Space scientists are eager to protect the option of doing astronomy from the moon.\\nThere are plans in the works to place astronomical hardware on the lunar landscape such as super-cooled infrared telescopes,\\u00a0a swath of gravitational wave detectors, large Arecibo-like radio telescopes, even peek-a-boo instruments tuned up to seek out evidence for \\\"out there\\\" aliens.\\nYes, the future of lunar astronomy beckons. But some scientists say there's an urgent need to protect any moon-based astronomical equipment from interference caused by other planned activities on the moon, ensuring they can carry out their mission of probing the surrounding universe.\\nTo that end, efforts are ongoing to scope out and create policy in conjunction with the United Nations in the hope of fostering international support for such protections.\\n\\nThis action plan is spearheaded by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU brings together more than 12,000 active professional astronomers from over 100 countries worldwide.\\nRichard Green is chair of the IAU group specific to looking at the issues of staging astronomy from the moon. He is also an assistant director for government relations at Steward Observatory, run by the University of Arizona in Tucson.\\nThe IAU working group is aiming to collaborate with a number of other non-governmental organizations to protect the option of doing astronomy from the moon, Green tells Space.com.\\nA number of participants in the IAU working group are spectrum managers from radio observatories, strongly linked to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and ITU's World Radiocommunication Conference, a treaty-level forum to review and revise, if necessary, radio regulations and global agreements regarding use of the radio-frequency spectrum and the geostationary-satellite and non-geostationary-satellite orbits.\\nThe working group members want to maximize the range of protected frequencies, \\\"including the very low frequencies needed to study the early universe and auroral emissions from planets,\\\" Green says.\\nThe other approach, says Green is for protection of sites on the moon that might be suitable for cooled infrared telescopes or gravitational wave detector arrays.\\n\\\"We have common cause with those who want to protect historical legacy sites and even those who want dedicated sites for extracting water or minerals,\\\" Green says. \\\"We imagine that the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is the venue in which some process can be developed to claim a site for protection and to resolve competing claims.\\\"\\nThe IAU Astronomy from the moon working group has space law and policy experts who can provide a strong basis for that approach, Green says.\\n\\\"Of course, the main goal is to conduct astronomical observations that can be uniquely done from the moon,\\\" Green explains. The working group is embracing the expertise of principal investigators of lunar missions or concepts for missions.\\nDoing so, Green says, can help engage the astronomical community in prioritizing sites of extreme scientific interest and take in issues of conducting science in an environment for which \\\"equitable access\\\" is anchored in the spirit of the United Nations 1967 Outer Space Treaty.\\nA thumbs-up approval of the IAU initiative is Ian Crawford, a professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck College, London.\\n\\\"My own view is that a subset of lunar locations, for example specific polar craters and key far side locations, need to be designated as 'Sites of Special Scientific Importance' and protected as such, Crawford told Space.com.\\nA possible\\u00a0model, Crawford suggests, might be the\\u00a0Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) as defined in Annex V of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty.\\n\\\"In any case, international coordination is clearly required so United Nations involvement appears entirely appropriate,\\\" Crawford says.\\nNASA is working with several U.S. firms to deliver science and technology to the moon's surface by way of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (CLPS) initiative.\\nGiven the uptick in future CLPS-enabled robotic lunar exploration, we are about to the see the first NASA-funded science payloads landed there in over 51 years \\u2014 since the Apollo 17 human moon landing in December 1972, says Jack Burns, professor emeritus in the department of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\\nOne payload, for which Burns serves as co-investigator, is called the Radio Wave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath (ROLSES). If successful, it would be the first radio telescope on the moon and situated at the lunar south pole. ROLSES is to be emplaced there in February via the Intuitive Machines Nova-C lunar lander's IM-1 mission under the CLPS partnership.\\nThis will be followed in two years by the Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment-Night, or LuSEE-Night, slated to fly in 2026 aboard the Firefly Aerospace Blue Ghost Mission-2 lander. This endeavor is also part of the CLPS undertaking and Burns is a science team member of the LUNAR far side experiment.\\nLuSee-Night is a radio telescope that will look into the never-before seen dark ages of the early universe \\u2014 a time before the birth of the first stars.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWith this potential and promising burgeoning of radio astronomy from the moon, Burns says \\\"it is essential that we now develop international agreements to protect the far side of the moon for radio astronomy as it is the only truly radio-quiet site in the inner solar system.\\\"\\nBurns emphasizes that radio observations from the moon are no longer science fiction but science fact.\\n\\\"We are entering a new era of science investigations from our nearest neighbor in space,\\\" Burns says.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"The smell of vinyl and the sound of a clacking sewing machine will soon be replaced by the aroma of fresh-baked sourdough and the din of diners at 247 Linden St.\\nBread Fellow, a new bakery and cafe in Fort Collins, is set to open in the historic 1882 building in late February, marking a new life for the longtime former auto upholstery shop. The bakery's opening will also signify the end of eight years of closed doors and a two-year redevelopment project that has transformed the space from top to bottom.\\nThe building is the first project for Snagwood, a Boulder-based development business focused on restoring historic mixed-use buildings in walkable downtown areas across Colorado. The company purchased the Tubbs and Cowan block at 247 and 249 Linden St. \\u2014 best known for its decades as Joe's Auto Upholstery \\u2014 in 2021, according to Snagwood founder and owner Drew Fink.\\n\\\"I felt like downtown Fort Collins was a uniquely special historic center \\u2014 it's expansive, it's cohesive, it's been really well preserved,\\\" Fink told the Coloradoan. \\\"At the same time, you have a lot of creatives and entrepreneurs. (It) felt like a really vibrant place.\\\"\\nWalking the line between a full table service and fast-casual restaurant, Bread Fellow is looking to strike a balance with its elevated food and cozy atmosphere, according to co-owner and founder Jenn Webb.\\nThe small-batch bakery and cafe is the latest project for Jenn and her husband, Andrew Webb, who opened Bindle Coffee together out of an old mechanic's garage in the redeveloped Jessup Farm Artisan Village back in 2015.\\nBread Fellow has been in the works for about two years \\u2014 roughly around the time the Webbs found the Linden Street space and became part of its redevelopment plans.\\nThe bakery and cafe will focus on sourdough with an emphasis on nourishing foods, including soups, bread, toast and weekend brunch, Jenn said.\\n\\\"(It's) an elevated version of what we're currently doing,\\\" she added, referring to Bindle Coffee. \\\"We'll still have a full espresso bar and pastries, but with the addition of sourdough bread and breakfasts and lunches.\\\"\\n\\nBread Fellow is hoping to softly open in late February, Jenn said. Its hours will be 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday.\\nSince purchasing the Tubbs and Cowan block, Snagwood has rebuilt the building's interior, which had been gutted prior to its 2021 sale, into a mixed-use space with Bread Fellow on its ground floor and an apartment on its second floor. The apartment will be used as a short-term rental, according to Fink.\\nAs part of the apartment's renovation, Fink said Snagwood preserved the building's original second-story window openings and used a historically accurate plaster on its brick walls.\\nWith the exception of replacing its garage doors, windows and trim \\u2014 as well as the repair and repainting of its original brick \\u2014 few changes were made to the exterior of the building, Fink added. Of the changes made, all fit within the Secretary of the Interior's standards for the\\u00a0treatment of historic properties since Snagwood is seeking state and federal tax credits for the project, he said.\\nThe building has been listed as a contributing structure in Fort Collins' locally and nationally designated Old Town Historic District since the late 1970s.\\nAlmost all the materials salvaged from the building during its interior demolition have also been cleaned and repurposed for use in Bread Fellow \\u2014 from its original 1880s interior wood framing to its floor and roof boards, Fink said.\\nMeanwhile, in a garage on the other side of Jefferson Street, another homage to 247 Linden St. is in the works.\\nWhen I walked into Joe's Auto Upholstery's Willow Street shop early this week, I was greeted by the characteristic quiet of a Monday morning, the slight chill of an airy Colorado garage in January and Richard Cienfuegos.\\nThe 77-year-old has spent practically all his life around Joe's Auto Upholstery \\u2014 the business his father, Joe Cienfuegos, started after coming home to Fort Collins following his service in World War II.\\nAfter first running his upholstery business out of an auto repair shop at the corner of Jefferson and Linden streets, Richard said his parents, Joe and Teresa, purchased the building at 247 and 249 Linden St. around 1952. It set them back $7,000, according to Richard.\\n\\\"That was a lot back then,\\\" he said. 'The average wage then was only $1 an hour for grown men \\u2014 not even that.'\\nBy then, the Italianate-style building \\u2014 which had spent its early years as a restaurant; furniture store; and, later, a feed, hay, coal and harness shop, according to local blog Northern Colorado History \\u2014 had settled into its life as an auto service station. The building had been modified with a garage door by at least 1929, per historic building permits, and was home to Hawley's Auto Top Shop when the Cienfuegos family took it over, Richard said.\\nWant more Fort Collins history? Check out The Coloradoan's binge-worthy 'podpast' podcast\\nRichard remembered working alongside his dad and brothers, Joe Jr. and George, in the Linden Street shop, which was often characterized by the smell of vinyl fabric, the trill of a sewing machine and the hiss of Joe's air stapler \\u2014 an amazingly modern gadget back in the 1950s, Richard recalled with a laugh.\\n\\\"It's a great building. My dad always said, 'Linden Street's the place to make your living,' \\\" Richard recalled, noting that the downtown street was once home to multiple grocery stores, a furniture store and auto shops like Joe's Auto Upholstery.\\nJoe ran the shop until his retirement around 1985, when Richard took over the business. He died in 2011.\\nRichard said Linden Street got increasingly busy over the years, with regular 8-to-5 businesses like Joe's Auto Upholstery giving way to more bars that catered to Colorado State University students. In 2015, after more than 60 years in the Cienfuegos family, Richard sold the building. Roughly five years ago, he moved the auto upholstery shop to its current location at 310 Willow St.\\nIt was there, surrounded by tables of fabric samples and walls lined with antique clocks and telephones, that Richard directed me to a table near the center of his shop Monday and gently lifted up a panel of vinyl fabric lined with a quilt-like pattern of stitches.\\nAs part of the redevelopment, the \\\"Joe's Auto Upholstery\\\" sign that once hung above the business's door will be showcased in a decorative display case constructed from the building's original lumber and set against this upholstered piece from Richard.\\nOnce finished, it will be returned, backlit and displayed in the only home it knows: 247 Linden St.\\nThis article originally appeared on Fort Collins Coloradoan: Fort Collins restaurants: Bakery taking over Joe's Upholstery space\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"\\u2018You should be very proud,' said Chemmy Alcott, as my face smacked into thick snow for the third time and my goggles began to steam up with the exertion of constantly righting myself. 'You're one of the first 100 people to come through here this season. You're flattening the trail, making it easier for everyone else.'\\nAlcott, a one-time Olympic downhill ninja and now the effervescent co-host of the BBC's Ski Sunday, had swung us into the Hidden Valley, one of her secret showstoppers in the Tignes area, after delivering a warning. 'This is off-piste,' she said, suddenly serious. 'So you do this at your own risk.'\\nAs we jittered on to the snaking trail, which was about the width of a tea tray, we quickly realised this wasn't a valley at all: more of a tight, twisting gorge, flanked by sheer-sided boulders and dotted with hair-raising drops that even Alcott couldn't descend without taking off her skis.\\n'What a mellow morning,' she said breezily, as the sunlight cascaded through the pines all around us. That wouldn't have been my word for it, especially when the track veered into a delightful snow-dusted forest. I caught an edge and ended up cartwheeling down the mountain, almost taking out some hikers snowshoeing up through the drifts. 'Those runs we did to get here,' said Alcott when I finally caught back up, 'they're lovely and they're fun \\u2013 but they're not memorable. This is memorable.'\\nIt was a spectacular introduction to the many delights of Tignes \\u2013 and it was just the warm-up. Ahead lay the Four Corners Challenge: an up-at-dawn, skip-the-long-lunch sprint around the extremities of Espace Killy, as the linked area of Tignes and Val d'Is\\u00e8re is called. This odyssey reaches its giddying climax atop the wind-blasted Grande Motte glacier, some 3,456 metres up.\\nI was able to enjoy these breathtaking mountains without the gnawing guilt generally associated with reaching them\\nAs I lay sweating in the hotel sauna that evening, I could feel the impact of the slopes on every bit of my body. But nowadays, of course, you also have to think about your own impact on the slopes. Global heating is already having a devastating effect on the Alps, with the lack of snowfall leaving resorts, especially lower ones, struggling to stay open for the whole season. One, La Sambuy, has permanently closed its slopes.\\nFor once, though, I was able to enjoy these breathtaking mountains without the gnawing guilt generally associated with reaching them. I'd come by rail, departing from London St Pancras at 9am on a Saturday \\u2013 aboard the inaugural journey of Eurostar's resurrected Snow Train, a service axed in 2020 when Covid struck.\\nAfter one rapid change at Lille, where we didn't even have to switch platforms, our roomy TGV eased into Bourg St Maurice after nightfall, having sped past some ravishing sunsets over gleaming lakes. The train certainly seemed popular with Brits: our hurtling juggernaut ran out of tea in one hour flat. From Bourg, in the heart of the French Alps, it was just 40 minutes by minibus to Tignes.\\nWhile transport will make up the lion's share of any snow holiday's carbon footprint, hotels play a part too. We stayed at Rosset, a chalet-style hotel boasting a swish top-floor bar with mountain views, plush sofas, a crackling, cheek-sizzling log fire, and a seemingly endless supply of post-piste cake and pre-dinner canap\\u00e9s and fizz.\\nNo wonder the apr\\u00e8s in Tignes and Val d'Is\\u00e8re tends to mean dancing on tables: the adrenalin just keeps coming\\nA five-minute walk from the Tignes lifts, Rosset has implemented waste, water and even clingfilm reduction methods, along with refillable toiletry dispensers and the requirement that guests pick dinner in advance, cutting down on food waste. This allowed me to choose from miso aubergine, roasted sea bass or steamed mussels, while biting into goat's cheese on sourdough toast at breakfast.\\nWater is from the tap (bottled can be supplied) and the overall ethos is less meat, more veg, and a push to source locally \\u2013 right down to the artworks on the walls. The hefty black-and-white images depict brooding and often cloud-shrouded mountains, all supplied by a local photography collective called Art'com and a far cry from the usual bland blue skies over airy peaks.\\nThe Four Corners required an early morning trip on the Scare Chair, the nickname given to the Leissi\\u00e8res link to the Pisaillas glacier, an oasis of fabulous and generally less-busy runs. Widely regarded as the world's most frightening lift, the Scare Chair is a stomach-churning, high-speed ride up to a gnarled mountain ridge, followed by a lurching plummet down its other side.\\nIt didn't disappoint, providing a glorious gateway to everything that is great about Tignes, one of the highest resorts in Europe. You can knock about all day on its wide, weaving, twisting, banking, bread-and-butter runs, bouncing in and out of powder fields off-piste. But should you also have a yearning to go high, far and fast, Tignes takes some beating \\u2013 as we discovered on every thrilling inch of the Four Corners, not least that long, final, dizzying descent from Grande Motte, reached by a funicular that shoots up a tunnel like a bullet through the black.\\nNo wonder the apr\\u00e8s in Tignes and Val d'Is\\u00e8re tends to mean dancing on tables: the adrenalin just keeps coming. 'I was voted the best dancer in Folkestone!' said the woman sharing a tabletop with me at the Folie Douce, or Sheer Madness, a legendary open-air party palace that blasts out bangers in the peaks above Val d'Is\\u00e8re, just as the sun begins to set. Chemmy Alcott, a Folie Douce superfan, had by now left us, but I could imagine her saying: 'Other bars are lovely and fun \\u2013 but they're not memorable.' The Folie Douce, with its resident dancers in spangled outfits sharing stage space with a swirling light show, is certainly memorable.\\nThere was plenty of cool kit on show (as well as two guys in Teletubby costumes). But I was pleased to notice, among all the flashy big brands, the occasional piece of Re-Action gear. Re-Action is a global collective with a branch in nearby Courchevel. There, five staff recycle the uniforms of, say, lift operators, ski instructors and chalet staff, repairing and patching costly garments that are generally tossed into landfill after just a few seasons.\\n'I used to own two boot-fitting shops,' Re-Action's founder Gavin Fernie-Jones told me, over beer at the Loop bar in Tignes. 'But I got tired of seeing the consumption and waste in the industry. People will even buy kit and just dispose of it at the end of their holiday. But we can take a \\u20ac400 jacket, patch it up, put it on sale for \\u20ac120 \\u2013 and it'll be gone in seconds.'\\nFernie-Jones, who is 43 and originally from the Peak District, was wearing a '50/50', a Re-Action speciality in which two jacket halves are spliced together, in this case one grey and one teal. It looked fantastic. 'We want our stuff to be identifiable,' he said. 'We've got our own look. The patches aren't meant to blend in. They celebrate the work.'\\nIn terms of eco-thinking, he added, Tignes is one of the better resorts, boasting Flocon Vert, or Green Snowflake, status. 'Imagine mountains without bins,' says a common sign on its lifts. 'Take your rubbish home with you.' So I did: mostly napkins, tin cans and used teabags, which I zipped into my bag as I left my hotel room, glancing one last time at the framed message on the table. 'Help us go greener,' it said, 'so our mountains don't.'\\nTrip provided by Inghams Ski, which offers seven nights half-board at Hotel Rosset, Tignes, departing from London St Pancras, from \\u00a31,438 per person, based on two adults sharing.

I've never had so many compliments on my hair and I put it half the effort I did previously.

      "            \"summary\": \"Writers draw inspiration from countless sources and experiences. For a younger Nilo Cruz, a New York Times story about the 1991 arrest and imprisonment of Cuban poet and novelist Mar\\u00eda Elena Cruz Varela helped spark his play 'Two Sisters and a Piano.'\\n'She and her friends wrote a manifesto asking for Cuba to open up, the equivalent of perestroika,' Cruz says in a Zoom interview from his Miami apartment on a rare day off from the production of 'Two Sisters' he's directing for Miami New Drama. 'Brigadiers dragged her into the street and tried to force her to eat the manifesto. She spent two years in prison and another year under house arrest.'\\n'Two Sisters and a Piano,' which previews at Miami Beach's Colony Theatre on Thursday, Jan. 25, and Friday, Jan. 26, then officially opens with an already sold-out performance on Saturday, Jan. 27, follows last season's box office and critical success with Miami New Drama's Cruz-directed production of 'Anna in the Tropics,' which was seen by 8,700 theatergoers, according to the Miami-based theater company. That play was a life-changing work of art that made Cruz the first Latino winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2003.\\n'Two Sisters' is an earlier play, a kind of prelude to 'Anna in the Tropics' in its exploration of the power of literature, the escape that words and the imagination can provide, the relationship of two disparate sisters. It began in the 1990s as a radio play, then was expanded for its 1999 world premiere at the Tony Award-winning McCarter Theatre Center in Princeton, New Jersey, where Cruz found ongoing champions for his work in former artistic director-playwright Emily Mann and dramaturg Janice Paran.\\nReturning to 'Two Sisters and a Piano' in Florida at this moment in time, Cruz says, seems right \\u2013 particularly since so many school districts here have banned books.\\n'(Cuba is) a country we criticize because of dictatorships, but here we are in the United States where books are being censored, not just because of sexual content but because of historical content as well,' says the playwright, who came to Miami from Cuba on a 1970 Freedom Flight when he was 10. 'I read books like \\u2018The Bluest Eye,' \\u2018The Diary of Anne Frank,' \\u2018To Kill a Mockingbird' as a teenager. They had an impact on me, understanding words as a way to escape oppression.'\\nCruz's two sisters are Maria Celia (Thais Menendez), a novelist whose husband Antonio has left for Europe, where he's working to get her out of Cuba, and the younger Sofia (Stephanie Machado), a talented pianist and imaginative romantic. After two years in prison, the women have come back to the Obispo family's once-stately home, now stripped of much of its furniture and treasures \\u2013 except for Sofia's precious piano.\\nTwo men \\u2013 one a dangerous official with an agenda, the other an amusing romantic who loves music as much as Sofia does \\u2013 enter the sisters' closed-off world.\\nLieutenant Portuondo (Maurice Compte) has been confiscating Maria Celia's letters to Antonio, and his to her. He's trying to crack the coded communication between the couple \\u2013 while at the same time finding himself increasingly beguiled by the writer and her prose.\\nAlthough the sisters have a permit to have their badly neglected piano tuned, they wait, then wait some more, for someone to arrive. Victor Manuel (Gabriell Salgado) finally does, and he proves to be everything that the yearning Sofia could desire.\\n'Two Sisters and a Piano' has had a sporadic presence in South Florida, including a 2008 production at the now-closed Promethean Theatre in Davie, where actors Deborah L. Sherman and Ursula Cataan (who originated the roles of sisters Conchita and Marela in New Theatre's 2002 world premiere of 'Anna in the Tropics') played Maria Celia and Sofia.\\nCruz, who writes and publishes his plays in English, translated 'Two Sisters' into Spanish in 2019 and staged a production for Miami's Arca Images at Miami Dade County Auditorium's On.Stage Black Box. In June 2023, he directed a production at Two River Theater in Red Bank, New Jersey, using his original English script; ditto at Miami New Drama.\\nAs he did with 'Anna in the Tropics' at last season, Cruz has approached the new 'Two Sisters and a Piano' with deep knowledge gleaned from past productions coupled with a collaborative willingness to take a fresh approach with the actors and designers, including Carbonell Award-winning set designers Christopher and Justin Swader.\\n'I wanted to explore the metaphor of suspension. When you walk into the production, you'll see the furniture that was taken hanging in midair. Later, you'll see a suspended labyrinth of letters from Maria Celia and her husband,' says Cruz, who was inspired by his memory of a long-ago exhibition with suspended works of art at the Duomo in Naples, Italy. 'The suspension applies to the lives of the women, the island itself and the sisters' future.'\\nCruz has also added something to the script: a monologue for Victor Manuel, the piano tuner who is deeply drawn to Sofia but afraid of the consequences if he continues to act on his feelings 'in a world that is so vigilant,' says the playwright.\\nAll four cast members grew up in Miami, though only Salgado still lives here. Cruz has been inspired by them during the give-and-take of rehearsals, and vice versa.\\nThe marquee name in the cast belongs to Compte, whose father Roman fought at the Bay of Pigs and later ran the Mutiny Hotel in Coconut Grove in its flashy heyday; a limited-series MGM+ crime thriller, 'Hotel Cocaine,' starring Miami native Danny Pino as Roman Compte, should begin airing this summer. Of note: 'Hotel Cocaine' was created by Chris Brancato, the co-creator of the Netflix series 'Narcos,' which featured Maurice Compte as Horacio Carillo in a dozen episodes.\\nThe younger Compte has done theater in the past, some in his hometown where he went to Miami Senior High, but his very long list of credits is largely focused on film and television. He said yes to 'Two Sisters and a Piano,' he says, 'because of Nilo and Miami New Drama.'\\nCompte has a vivid memory of going to the Colony Theatre in 1995 to see a production of 'Romeo and Juliet' starring Pino and Blaine Dunham.\\n'I thought, \\u2018One day I'll come back and be the lead here in a play,' says Compte.\\nThe actor is enthralled with the discoveries that come during the rehearsal process, making tiny adjustments, solidifying choices. He finds Cruz's unique writing style both descriptive and colorful, lying somewhere between reality and a dream world.\\nAs an actor, Cruz says, 'Maurice has a certain mystery, ambiguity, rawness, danger, which is like what Marlon Brando had.'\\nMenendez comes from a Cuban American family, Machado from a Brazilian one. Both grew up reading or seeing Cruz's plays and seem a little in awe of working with him.\\nMenendez appeared in GableStage's intense production of Charise Castro Smith's 'El hurac\\u00e1n' ('The Hurricane') last season with Adriana Savan, who played Maria Celia in the 2000 Public Theater production of 'Two Sisters' in New York. She says of Cruz, 'Just because it's his play doesn't mean he knows everything. He knows what works. But you get the sense he's doing it with fresh eyes every time.'\\nA Boston College graduate who speaks fluent Spanish and French as well as English, Menendez has found a key to Cruz's distinctive style: 'Nilo's writing is like singing. It has melody, rhythm and crescendos. He writes in English, but the sentence structure is the way it is in Spanish.'\\nCruz cast Menendez, who is younger than some actors who have played Maria Celia, because this time he wanted the character to be 'someone who hasn't had enough time in her marriage, someone longing for children. I wanted her to have physical beauty and a certain elegance, holding onto an Old World dignity.'\\nTo play Sofia, he chose Machado, who has a master's degree in acting from Yale, also because of the way she exudes elegance \\u2013 and more.\\n'She has so many tools at her disposal \\u2013 she embodies fragility and innocence, but she can also be comedic and tragic. I told her, \\u2018You're meant to be in my plays,'' he says.\\nMachado, who speaks Portuguese as well as English, lives in New York where she teaches and acts ('I vowed I would never wait tables,' she says, laughing). When her father comes to 'Two Sisters and a Piano' on opening night, it will be the first time he has seen her perform since her days as a high school musical theater major at Miami's New World School of the Arts.\\nCruz, she says, is a wonderful writer and director.\\n'I love heightened text. It's what drew me to Nilo from the get-go. His language can get so poetic, but it's rooted in truth. His characters want big things,' she observes. 'The way he directs is also poetic. He told me that the character I'm playing \\u2018is like a pomegranate about to explode.' He has so much dignity and poise.'\\nMachado had a 'pinch me' moment in rehearsals when she and Menendez were working on a scene in which the sisters 'escape' by dressing up and dancing together.\\n'He helped us do the salsa. It hit me all at once: Here I am dancing with Nilo Cruz, looking into his eyes, doing this play in Miami,' she says. 'He's not pompous at all. He just nonchalantly throws wisdom at us.'\\nSalgado, a New World college grad who appeared with Menendez in 'El hurac\\u00e1n,' has built an eclectic resume appearing at theaters throughout South Florida, most recently adding his turn as one very funny cook in 'Clyde's' for Miami's Zoetic Stage. Last season, he played the pivotal role of the dreamy lector in Cruz's 'Anna in the Tropics,' and though Salgado intended to focus on film projects this season, Cruz, 'Two Sisters' and Miami New Drama drew him back to the stage.\\n'Nilo wrote this beautiful monologue, which I wasn't aware of until the first day of rehearsals\\u2026There is definitely humor in this play. I'm practically doing clown work, borderline physical comedy for the scenes in the first act,' says Salgado.\\nHe adds: 'I have never felt more in my wheelhouse than I do now. Every time Nilo does something, it's like he's doing it for the first time. He puts all the same sand in the sandbox, but when he takes it out he builds a new castle\\u2026What a genuine, present, vulnerable and gracious director and artist he is.'\\nOnce 'Two Sisters and a Piano' is up and running, Cruz will have very little time before going into rehearsals for his next project: the world premiere of 'Sed en la calle del agua' ('Thirst on Water Street') for Arca Images. The Spanish-language production, which will have simultaneous English translation, will have a brief run at the On.Stage Black Box from Thursday, March 14, to Sunday, March 17. About an artist fighting to regain her sanity after a tragedy, it is set in a New York asylum, with flashbacks to earlier days in Mexico.\\nCruz is also writing a new play for Miami New Drama, creating a historical play for Ford's Theatre in Washington D.C., working on likely New York productions of 'Two Sisters and a Piano' at Classic Stage Company and 'Anna in the Tropics' by an as-yet unannounced major company. In 2025, 'El ultimo sue\\u00f1o de Frida y Diego' ('The Last Dream of Frida and Diego'), with music by Gabriela Lena Frank and a libretto by Cruz, will mark the playwright's Metropolitan Opera debut.\\nAnd he has other projects in the works too.\\nThe workflow, he says with a smile, can make him 'feel like Sisyphus' as he does the playwright's equivalent of rolling a boulder up a hill over and over again. But at the same time, he's happy about what's on the horizon.\\n'I'll just be glad to be working in New York again,' says Cruz, who lives in Miami. 'It's my second home.'\\nWHAT: 'Two Sisters and a Piano' by Nilo Cruz\\nWHERE: Miami New Drama production at the Colony Theatre, 1040 Lincoln Road, Miami Beach\\nWHEN: 8 p.m. Thursday-Saturday, 3 p.m. Sunday, through Feb. 18\\nCOST: $46.50, $66.50, $69.50, $76.50, $83.50\\nINFORMATION: 305-674-1040 or www.miaminewdrama.org\\nArtburstMiami.com is a nonprofit media source for the arts featuring fresh and original stories by writers dedicated to theater, dance, visual arts, film, music and more.

Enhanced automated and efficient synthesis methods have effectively lowered production costs, enabling the creation of purer, more complex peptides.\\nNew York, Jan. 29, 2024 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The peptides market was valued at USD 45.5 billion in 2023 with significant growth and is projected to reach at USD 89.6 billion by 2033 with an outstanding CAGR of 7.2%.\\nThe peptide market is experiencing a surge in demand driven by the need for advanced treatments, particularly in addressing the rising incidence of metabolic disorders and cancer. Peptides, small chains of amino acids connected by peptide bonds, are crucial in mimicking natural biological processes. These tiny proteins, comprising 50 or fewer amino acids, play a substantial role in hormone production, cell signaling, and immune system activity.\\nCancer, affecting over 1.7 million individuals, results in 600,000 deaths annually in the United States alone, with healthcare expenditures reaching $185 billion. In India, approximately 1.46 million cancer cases were reported in 2022, highlighting the global impact of this disease. Peptide therapy emerges as a promising avenue, offering targeted treatment alternatives by interfering with specific cellular functions. Scientific studies support the reliability of peptide therapy, especially in cancer treatment, where peptides can selectively target tumor cells without affecting healthy ones.\\nPeptide therapy's health benefits extend beyond cancer treatment, encompassing anti-aging applications.

The bail bond serves as a surety bond, posted by the company to the court, guaranteeing that the arrestee will appear at the court hearings. Bail agents underwrite and issue bail bonds as official representatives of the company. Usually, these companies charge a percentage of the bail amount, which could differ from company to company. The companies also require collateral including cash, investments, or property before issuing a bail bond. Commercial or for-profit bail bond companies operate only in the US and the Philippines.\\nAccording to a report by IBIS World, the revenue of bail bond services in the US has grown to $2.4 billion, at a CAGR of 4.3%, from 2018 to 2023.

      "            \"summary\": \"Some 90,000 years ago, a group of humans walked across a sandy beach in the city of Larache on Morocco's northwest coast. Remarkably, archaeologists have found a large number of intact footprints from the journey. These represent the oldest human prints found in the region and among the earliest attributed to Homo sapiens worldwide.\\n\\nFootprints represent moments frozen in time that can reveal fascinating details on everything from stature, age and body mass to speed, gait and social behavior. After studying 85 of the most well-preserved fossilized prints found in Larache, the international team of researchers concluded they were made by at least five people, including children, an adolescent and adults. They detail their findings in a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports.\\n\\n'This is an exciting discovery, and it adds to other evidence that the Middle Stone Age inhabitants of Morocco were visiting the coast, presumably in search of food and other items,' Louise Humphrey, a bioarchaelogist with London's Natural History Museum who was not involved with the research, said over email.\\n\\nScientists stumbled upon the footprints in 2022. While on a field mission studying boulders on a rocky beach, they noticed an indentation in the ground, and closer inspection revealed more of them. In the study, they describe how they identified the markings as footprints based on anatomical characteristics reflective of human feet, such as a rounded heel, a plantar arch and relatively short toes. And they detail how they dated the rock containing the footprints using optically stimulated luminescence, a cutting-edge technique that measures when materials such as grains of sand last absorbed sunlight.\\n\\nMorocco is also home to the Jebel Irhoud archaeological site, where scientists discovered the earliest known fossilized remains of homo sapiens, dating back 300,000 years. The oldest known homo sapiens footprints, found in South Africa, date back 153,000 years.\\n\\nThe Larache researchers believe their footprints survived many millenia, at least in part, because they're located in a spot where a large boulder partially protects them from wave swells that would erode the site over time.\\n\\nThe last 90,000 years have seen around 78 feet of sediment deposited above the level of the footprints, Mouncef Sedrati, a life sciences professor at France's University of South Brittany and a co-author of the study, said in an interview.\\n\\n'It is conceivable that in recent years, with the frequent occurrence of storms, the cliff, of which the layer of footprints constitutes the current base, started to erode,' Sedrati said. 'Consequently, the rocky platform began to peel away layer by layer until it reached its present level, revealing the footprints in the process.'\\n\\nIt's unknown what, exactly, the ancient humans were doing on the beach. They could have just been passing through along two trails. But since our Pleistocene predecessors were hunter-gatherers, and past studies have shown the importance of coastal regions for their resource gathering, they likely were foraging for food. The orientation of their footprints perpendicular to the coastline suggests a search for a marine meal.\\n\\nThe researchers hypothesize that the children present in the group may have aided in that hunt, though further studies will be needed to validate this theory.\\n\\n'What is particularly exciting about this discovery is the entire paleontological and paleoanthropological potential it provides,' Sedrati said. 'We have only examined the best-preserved 85 footprints. Dozens more human and potentially animal prints remain to be explored and studied.'\",\n",

To get it in your inbox, subscribe here.\\n\\nVenture capital investors are obsessed with software businesses and healthcare is no different. The idea being that software equals the biggest opportunities with the highest profit margin and the greatest return on investment compared to more labor-intensive services businesses. But when Sam Toole and Marisa Bass, early stage healthcare investors at Primary, recently surveyed the IPOs and M&A exits of digital health unicorns over the past decade, the results were surprising. 'We would have thought that the software side would be way more efficient in terms of that enterprise value creation versus services,' Toole told Forbes.\\n\\nBut that wasn't the case \\u2013 even though healthcare software businesses had wildly outsized valuations over the past few years. When looking at total dollars raised divided by valuation on the public or private markets, the return for companies providing healthcare services was 4.7x, while companies selling software to health insurers and health systems came in at 3.8x, according to the Primary analysis. There's one big caveat here \\u2013 the analysis looked at companies started after 2010, which means neither Veeva Systems nor Livongo was part of the analysis.\\n\\nAs the IPO drought continues and startups have to raise more and more money, early stage investors can end up getting shafted if they don't participate in future fundraises. That's why Toole and Bass are starting to think about non-traditional funding structures, including tranche investments, such as co-leading rounds with bigger, later-stage VCs and giving the startup access to more money over time as it hits certain milestones. The question Toole and Bass posed was whether early stage investors should even invest in healthcare companies. And they're not throwing in the towel just yet. Toole believes the market is finally at a tipping point, more than a decade after the HITECH Act spurred the march towards electronic health records.\\n\\nAs health systems continue to be squeezed by cost pressures, including labor shortages, they are going to be looking to technology as a driver of efficiency. He believes we're at a tipping point of combining underlying technology with providers who are finally willing to adopt it. 'But the hardest thing was with venture investing,' he said, 'is if you're wrong from a timing perspective, it doesn't matter.'\\n\\nCrowdHealth wants you to ditch traditional health insurance for a new approach to managing expenses.

Teens under 18 seeking treatment for opioid or alcohol use disorders will be eligible for the program.\\n\\nAutoimmune Disease: Genentech has entered into a multi-year research agreement with San Francisco-based genetic medicine company GenEdit to develop nanoparticles to deliver drugs for autoimmune diseases. The deal includes a $15 million upfront payment to GenEdit, up to $629 million more in milestone payments and tiered royalties on any drugs that go to market.\\n\\nAI Diagnostics: Dutch company Thirona announced that its AI clinical software LungQ, which analyzes CT images of the lungs, has been cleared by the FDA for use in the United States.\\n\\nM&A: Sanofi announced that it's acquiring biotech company Inhibrix with an aim to acquire INBRX-101, a drug candidate for Alpha-1 Anytrypsin Deficiency.

      "            \"summary\": \"'It's not true that life is one damn thing after another \\u2013 it's one damn thing over and over.' \\u2014 Edna St. Vincent Millay\\nI've seen the 1993 film 'Groundhog Day' again and again and again, but only once on the big screen, a few years after it was in theaters. It was shown in a packed lecture hall inside Baltimore's Walters Art Museum, followed by a lecture from a comparative religion scholar who took us through the spiritual meaning and symbolism cleverly packaged in what, on its surface, is a rom-com with a 'Twilight Zone' premise.\\nEven if you haven't seen the film you still know the basic plot because the term 'Groundhog Day' has entered the common vernacular \\u2013 which alone speaks to its resonance beyond the film itself \\u2013 as shorthand for repeating the same experience over and over.\\nBut it's worth seeing, for the first time or the tenth, to witness self-centered weatherman Phil Connors (a role only Bill Murray could master) breaking that cycle through personal redemption. It's a grand metaphor some scholars see as Buddhist, Christian or secularly philosophical. It's also directly, practically applicable to how you spend your day today, and everyday.\\nI think the film is best described as 'Buddish,' an adjective coined by the film's director, Harold Ramis, to sum up his own belief system. His mother-in-law and one of his best friends were devout Zen Buddhists who hooked him onto its precepts. 'Memorable, simple, didn't require articles of faith, but completely humanistic in every way that I valued,' he said in aninterview for Chicago magazinein 2008. 'So I proselytize it without practicing it.'\\nAnd what an entertaining Buddish proselytization 'Groundhog Day' is. Like sushi or a Jamba Juice shake, it's so delicious you barely realize you're eating raw fish and fruit. That's the reason for this metaphysical movie's enduring cult status: a genuinely hilarious film that glimpses the meaning of life.\\nThere are many theories about Phil's temporal loop (which by one estimatelasted nearly 34 years) and his eventual escape. One sees it as ametaphor for psychotherapy: repeating the stories of one's past until you have a breakthrough that allows you to dismantle old patterns. Another claims it illustrates aclassic economic paradigm.\\nBut the most wisdom-invoking evidence amounts to religious insight and how to most fruitfully spend our precious hours.\\nOne of the central tenets of Buddhism is that we must continue to reincarnate until we find enlightenment. The concept, called samsara, keeps us living out many lives through 'various modes of existence' (called gati), some lowly animals and others god-like, as determined by your actions (karma). Once ignorance and ego are destroyed by your actions and awareness, you awaken to the true, interconnected reality, which frees you from the cycle and into heavenly nirvana.\\nIn the film \\u2013 written by Danny Rubin, a Zen Buddhist, according to Ramis' DVD commentary of the film \\u2014 Phil reincarnates each day, but he also transforms his behavior over 'time.' He takes self-centered advantage of his unique predicament \\u2013 robbing bank trucks, stuffing his face with angel food cake, tricking a woman into bed \\u2014 but eventually perfects the day with creative self-improvement tasks and compassionately helping others. Once he becomes the best possible version of Phil Connors, he is released from his temporal prison, while simultaneously winning the love of his virtuous producer, Rita.\\nPhil's plight is not unlike a character from Greek mythology who was doomed to eternally and perpetually push a boulder up a mountain. In his essay 'The Myth of Sisyphus,' Albert Camus uses the story to illustrate the absurdity of lives that toil away at meaningless jobs. But Camus says we must find hope, and therefore meaning, in such a plight and he imagines Sisyphus understanding and accepting it.\\nThere's a similar Buddhist tale of an enlightened monk who climbs a mountain to get a spoonful of snow in order to fill a well at the bottom of the mountain, again and again. Some lessons take a long and seemingly futile amount of time to learn. Buddhist monasticism is itself 'Groundhog'-like with the same routine, clothes and daily rituals \\u2014 for decades of practice.\\nYet every moment is still different. Remember what the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said: 'No man ever steps in the same river twice, for it's not the same river and he's not the same man.' In that sense, Phil doesn't repeat the same day over and over because one significant thing is different each Groundhog Day: him. He is the one thing that is changing.\\nWhat is time anyway? Illusory, says Buddhist dogma, a notion contained in the Zen koan Phil asks as he begins to understand that his own time is not progressing: 'What if there is no tomorrow? There wasn't one today.'\\nThat's right, woodchuck-chuckers, there is no past or future. There is only now.\\nThe Catholic concept of purgatory, a spiritual realm where souls must linger until they expiate their remaining sins and earn their way into heaven, fits the film's bill as much as the Buddhist concept samsara. And many references and motifs that recur in the film support the notion that 'Groundhog Day' is Christian rather than Buddhist. 'These sticky buns are heaven.' 'When you stand in the snow you look like an angel.' Thegroundhog hibernation\\u2014 rebirth after a death of sorts, and emerging from the sleepy tomb \\u2014 is reminiscent of Jesus.\\nThere's even a delightfully blasphemous scene in which Phil declares that he isagod. 'I'm nottheGod \\u2026 I don't think,' he wonders aloud as he contemplates how close he comes to the Catholic conception of monotheism. 'Maybe he's not omnipotent. He's just been around so long he knows everything.' This after he has shouted, like an angry deity, 'I make the weather!'\\nThen there's the film's montage with a homeless man whom Phil brushes off early on, patting his pants pockets like he doesn't have any cash. Later Phil tries to help repeatedly, only to find the man dies every time. It's the lesson of the Serenity Prayer, written by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and later co-opted by Alcoholics Anonymous:\\nGod, grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change,\\nThe courage to change the things I can,\\nAnd the wisdom to know the difference.\\nAfter accepting that he cannot save the old man, Phil turns an optimistic and meaningful corner in the plot and begins living in service to others (catching a falling boy from a tree, saving the mayor from choking etc). It's this change of direction that allows him to escape purgatory.\\nWhatever spiritual takeaway the film holds for you, it's an undeniable call for hope. Phil survives his many attempts at suicide \\u2013 leaping from a church, dropping a toaster in the tub, driving off a cliff \\u2013 and is reborn a hopeful, charitable man. Baptized by death and stronger for it on the other side, he tells his television audience: 'When Chekhov saw the long winter, he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope. Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life.'\\nWinter is such a great metaphor for the bleakness that precedes rebirth. 'I'll give you a winter prediction,' the weatherman reports in the 'hopeless' second act of the film. 'It's gonna be cold, it's gonna be gray, and it's gonna last you for the rest of your life.'\\nBut in a more optimistic stage he wakes up one happy morning and surprises a stranger with a hug and a Samuel Coleridge quote: 'Winter, slumbering in the open air, wears on its smiling face a dream\\u2026of spring.' It's from the sonnet 'Work Without Hope' which contains the famous line 'bloom for whom ye may,' which Phil does.\\nThis is the classic hero's journey. Phil is exiled into an unexpected adventure, despairs, suffers losses, but eventually learns how to overcome his obstacles and hopelessness. By the end of the film, he has managed to become the town hero for all the mitzvah he crams into a single day.\\nYou don't have to subscribe to Buddhism or Christianity or believe in reincarnation or heaven for this story to be directly applicable to your daily life.\\n'What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same, and nothing that you did mattered?' Phil asks a townie, Ralph, in the film.\\n'That about sums it up for me,' says Ralph.\\nAnd who doesn't relate, at one time or another, for one day, or many years, to that sentiment. It's Thoreau's 'life of quiet desperation.' It's Sisyphus. It's George Baileypre-epiphany in 'It's a Wonderful Life.'\\n'I think people place too much emphasis on their careers,' Phil says to Rita. 'I wish we could all live in the mountains, at high altitude. That's where I see myself in five years. How about you?' This sentiment echoes an earlier role in Murray's career as Larry Darrell in the movie, based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham, 'The Razor's Edge.' Darrell takes a pilgrimage to find enlightenment with Tibetan monks high in the Himalayas where he observes that, 'It's easy to be a holy man on top of a mountain.'\\nThe rest of us are down here in the valley, where it's harder. Each day is not that different than the last. We're on autopilot sometimes. We're bored. We repeat our bad habits. We are often self-centered and usually under-inspired.\\n\\nBut something does change every day, even if it's imperceptible. It's ourselves. And we can choose how this day will unfold, and how we will slowly evolve. There might even be a 'Groundhog Day'-inspired resolution: memorizing French poetry, playing the piano, figuring out how to help others more often. Like Phil, we can utilize creativity and compassion to change aglass-is-half-empty paradigm, to half full. The pursuit of meaning is itself meaningful. And today, as well as everyday, can be your first day of spring.\\nSign up for CNN's Stress, But Less newsletter.Our six-part mindfulness guidewill inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it.\",\n",

Or did you watch, enraptured and nauseous, and imagine what it would feel like to be sucked from your seat and tossed into a 16,000-foot free fall?\\n\\nOn Reddit, more than 2.4 million users follow a subreddit titled r/sweatypalms, a clearinghouse for videos of near-death experiences. Whatever it is you fear, you're sure to find it here.\\n\\nHere's a cougar stalking a hiker for six minutes.\\n\\nHere's a spelunker pinned in the narrow crevasse of a cave.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nThe subreddit's moderators declined to comment because 'none of us are qualified to be speaking on the human condition.' Fair.\\n\\nOne reason people seek these out, says Hoffner, is to overcome their fears. 'In a safe context, you can experience fear and desensitize yourself,' she says, pointing out it's a common treatment for phobias.\\n\\nThere are more specific subreddits, if you're addicted to a particular type of fear (and, perhaps, want to conquer it). On r/acrophobia, you can watch people dangling off cliff faces, skyscrapers, even the Eiffel Tower. You'll surely stumble up on the viral video from a GoPro camera on the head of a gentleman who climbs 2,000 feet up a skinny radio tower to change the lightbulb at the top.\\n\\nFilmmaker Scott Mann, so enticed by the genre, made a thriller titled 'Fall,' in which two climbers scale a similar tower and get stuck at the top. For about 107 minutes, they dangle and despair. It's horrifying! It reportedly made back 580 percent of its budget at the box office!\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\n'All our fears are baked into the question, \\u2018What if this happened to me?'' says Mann. 'The idea of your life hinging on something as minor as a squeaky bolt.'\\n\\nBut it's still a movie. It's still safe. And that, Mann suggests, is what makes real-life videos \\u2014 such as the one of Alaska Airlines \\u2014 so frightening.\\n\\nShare this article Share\\n\\n'The reason why the airplane [video] was particularly bad is because it wasn't in the safety of the cinema,' he says. 'It was reality. And that makes it all the worse. It's real life, and that's what gets me.'\\n\\nBut maybe heights aren't your thrill. Dread the deep ocean? Head over to r/thalassophobia to join the 1.6 million people watching videos of shipwrecks, deep-sea life and divers having panic attacks.\\n\\nOr head over to TikTok, where the North Sea has been trending. (Yes, the entire sea.) Clips show ships tossed around by massive waves, and crew members brushing their teeth while being thrown from wall to wall.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nChristina Huber will never visit the North Sea but she is 'most definitely, wholeheartedly terrified of the North Sea.'\\n\\n'I live on Lake Michigan, and I've seen how treacherous the waters can get,' says Huber, 29, a Chicago-based podcast host who goes by 'Bravo Babe.' 'Amplify that to the hundredth, and that's what these people are experiencing on the North Sea. Those ships nosedive straight into the water.'\\n\\nOur brains don't care whether the probability is low that we'll end up at the top of a radio tower or in the middle of the North Sea, says Coltan Scrivner, a behavioral scientist at the Recreational Fear Lab at Aarhus University and the department of psychology at Arizona State University.\\n\\n'Somebody found themselves in that situation. And we often find ourselves in situations we never thought we would be in,' Scrivner says. 'Your mind is still like, \\u2018Okay, this is really important. I should pay attention, because what if?''\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nScrivner conducted a study at the beginning of the pandemic and found that people who watched at least one movie about a pandemic, such as 'Contagion,' 'had better psychological resilience' than those who had not.\\n\\n'They'd seen it play out before,' he says. 'There was uncertainty, but it was sort of expected uncertainty.'\\n\\nWhat about the people who actually film these sweaty-palms videos?\\n\\nAlexis Landot, who's 23 and lives in Paris, learned to boulder when he was 8 years old, when his father put him in a gym to burn off his excess energy. Now, he scales skyscrapers without safety equipment, and records it.\\n\\nUnlike his viewers, he can't have sweaty palms when he's climbing. He actively tries to suppress the adrenaline that his fans crave.\\n\\nHe thinks his fans watch because they'd never do it themselves. Says Landot: 'This is the closest they will feel to what I'm doing.'\\n\\nSimon from Brooklyn might watch one of Landot's videos \\u2014 as long as Landot doesn't fall ... on a cat.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"MR. CAPEHART: Good afternoon, and welcome to Washington Post Live and another in our series on 'Race in America' co-produced with the 'Capehart' podcast. I am Jonathan Capehart, associate editor at The Washington Post. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight When Ava DuVernay's movie, \\\"Origin,\\\" premiered at the Venice Film Festival last year, it received a nine-minute standing ovation. The movie, written and directed by Ava DuVernay, is an adaptation of the bestselling book, \\\"Caste: The origins of Our Discontent,\\\" by Isabel Wilkerson. The film's power isn't just driven by the subject matter. It is driven by its lead actress Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, and she joins me now.\\n\\nAunjanue, thank you so much for being here. Welcome to Washington Post Live.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Thank you. Thank you for having me.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: So before we dive into the movie and your performance, let's talk about how your involvement came about. In interviews, Ava has said that she had been interviewing Isabel Wilkerson for two years to prepare for this film. At what point did Ava approach you, and what were those initial conversations like?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Well, I kind of approached her actually.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Oh.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I knew that--I had heard that she was--that she had adapted--was adapting the book. I just thought--I knew the book, right by reputation. I had not read it yet, but I just thought it was just this extraordinary thing that this extraordinary woman was going to do.\\n\\nAnd when I heard that she was starting to cast it, I said I want to be a part of that conversation. And so I--my sister and myself made a picture that sort of matched Ms. Wilkerson's kind of iconic photo that she has of herself, and we sent it to the casting director, and the casting director sent it to Ms. DuVernay. And then we started talking.\\n\\n[Laughter]\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Okay. So then you started talking. You get the role, but--\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I get the role. Thank God.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: But Wilkerson is famously private. I mean, I've been trying for three years since I got my MSNBC show to get her to come on my show just to talk about stuff and her books. How did you approach playing her? What did you do to prepare?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Well, one of the first conversations that I had with Ava about what she wanted to achieve with the film is that she was interested in dramatizing the interior life of a woman, the interior life of a Black woman, particularly a Black genius. And that is something that you rarely see in American cinema, particularly, with women, in general. We don't see the inner workings of a woman's mind, how she creates, how she makes. So that was fascinating to me and one of the reasons why I wanted to do it.\\n\\nAnd then having seen Ms. Wilkerson's interviews when \\\"Caste\\\" came out in 2020, this woman is a refined person, right? She is a wordsmith. So her words are her currency. It's her strategy. It's how she moves through the world is a power of her words. So what I had to do in lieu of meeting her, because I didn't get a chance to meet her--hopefully, I will one day--I had to study her. I had to study her interviews. I had to study her--that famous TED Talk she did when \\\"Warmth of Other Suns\\\" came out. I studied that over and over and over again, and that was my source material.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nAnd I'm sure you would attest to as well, Jonathan, that her writing--one of the reasons probably why you want to talk to her is her writing is so brilliant, and one of the reasons why her writing is so brilliant is that she's so transparent in her approach to her subjects. In other words, she is always present in her writing, her personal life. Her own experiences are always present. It makes her very accessible.\\n\\nSo I just went to her book and pulled out what I could from that book, what I felt was her.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: I'm sorry. I am--I am speechless, because here you play this, as you call it, Black genius.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Yes,\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: And she's so notoriously private that you haven't even met her yet.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: No, I haven't. I haven't--\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Have you heard from her since the movie came out?\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I haven't. I haven't heard from her.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: And so--\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I'm terrified. I'm terrified. I'm terrified. Can I just be honest? I'm terrified.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Wait. Why?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I'm terrified because I--you know, when you--I had this conversation a couple of weeks ago, and someone was in the process of doing--writing a biography. I think it was Alexis Pauline Gumbs, and she was talking about her biography work. And in the process of that conversation, I said, \\\"I'm a biographer on screen.\\\" That is a responsibility. That is a huge responsibility, whether someone is dead or alive, but someone who is still in--so there's--you know, if someone is not around anymore, not walking around, you can really--you can really go into the imagination. Right?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Mm-hmm.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: But at this point, this woman is walking around right now. She's present. She's writing. She's a part of our human--she's a part of our American conversation at this moment, and the audacity of me--\\n\\n[Laughter]\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Do you know what I'm saying?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Right.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: To attempt to portray this woman, this huge force in our culture, I'm terrified. I don't--I don't know what she thinks. I have to not think about it, but yes, I'm terrified.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Well, I will say two things about that. One, she could not help but be proud of the performance you give of her. You are the central--the central character in this story, and I want to get to that in a second. But also, I will tell you, I interviewed the cast and a lot of the producers of the new NatGeo series, \\\"Genius: MLK/X.\\\"\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Mm-hmm.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: And I asked Kelvin Harrison, who plays Martin Luther King Jr, you know, how did it feel to play that role, and he said he was terrified--\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Mm-hmm.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: --terrified to play such an historic figure. So I just throw that out to you. Dead or alive, if you're--if the person you're portraying is a genius or a monumental figure, terror comes with the role. It comes with the role.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Right, right. Because it just doesn't belong to you. It doesn't just belong to you. It belongs to, of course, them. But also, it belongs to the people who read her books, who are inspired by her, and I'm one of them. Yeah.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: So let's talk--so let's talk more about the book. I've read both \\\"Warmth of Other Suns\\\" and \\\"Caste,\\\" and \\\"Warmth of Other Suns,\\\" I could see immediately how that could be a movie. But when it came to \\\"Caste,\\\" it was--you know, the idea that that would be a movie, given the thick subject matter, was a little hard for me to wrap my head around until I saw how Ava DuVernay did it. And she did it by making Isabel Wilkerson the focal point of this--of the story there. There is no real antagonist unless you look at \\\"Caste\\\" and her journey. But talk to me about, you know, what it was like for you to be in a movie that is about a book, where in the book, the author is not the central character, but in the movie, the author is the central character. And the journey to what became \\\"Caste\\\" is what the movie is about.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Well, that's a mark of the visionary work of Ava, of Ava DuVernay. In her research of--with Ms. Wilkerson and talking to her, interviewing her, which also lasted several years, a few years, she found out or discovered really that Ms. Wilkerson herself is a compelling character. I mean, we know that. But what she didn't know was what was happening in her personal life leading up to her writing this book, and what was happening or what had happened was that she was experiencing--she was experiencing incredible loss, unbelievable loss, losing three people in a very--three of the most important people in her life in a very short amount of time. And then she writes this book. Right? That changed--that shifted how we think about race in this country, how we think about social divisions in this country. She went through that and then wrote this book.\\n\\nMost of us would just be felled by that, and we wouldn't get up ever again, you know?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Right.\\n\\nAdvertisement\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I know when I lost the love of my life, I was silly for years, and I'm still going through it.\\n\\nAnyway, so Ava found our hero in Ms. Wilkerson, and I had to embrace that idea. And I just think of her as an Indiana Jones, you know, going around the world on this intellectual and journalistic quest, and the boulder that's behind her is this, you know, mammoth grief that is--that she's suffering from. And yet she keeps going because her quest is nothing short of saving us, saving humanity.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: That is an incredible--yes, she is like--that is a great analogy. She is like Indiana Jones. She is--let's talk about the first spark that drives this film, and that is the killing of Trayvon Martin. And in this scene that we're about to show, your character gets into--gets into it with a persistent editor over the meaning of racism. Watch.\\n\\n[Video plays]\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: All right. So that conversation sparks a journey for Wilkerson and the movie, which is as much about Wilkerson's pursuit of an idea as it is about the idea itself. Her theory is complex. She writes, and I quote, \\\"Race, in the United States, is the visible agent of the unseen force of caste. Caste is the bones, race the skin.\\\"\\n\\nAunjanue, how has this experience working on this film changed the way you view some of these issues of race, justice, and oppression?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: It's changed it dramatically. Dramatically. I would say--I would say in three ways.\\n\\nShare this article Share\\n\\nFirst of all, she's given me language for something that I thought but did not have the language for, if that makes sense.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Mm-hmm.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: For example, she builds her argument with these eight pillars of caste showing how her argument for caste, with these sort of eight ideas, and one of those ideas is how terrorism is used as a means of control.\\n\\nI am from the rural South. I am from Southwest Mississippi, and I live that. I live that. It is a part of my life. These statues, these flags that are everywhere, even now, where I live and knowing, knowing the origin of that gives me language that I did not have before, knowing that these flags and these statues were not erected out of a geography, we're honoring our fallen heroes, but in fact, that they were--they were erected to intimidate, to remind newly emancipated slaves where they came from and where they could easily go back to.\\n\\nAnd then, also, I would say it's given me a broader understanding of how we are connected with people around the world. I mean, the fact that Nazis--the Nazis studied Jim Crow in America to figure out the blueprint for how they would go about Nazism in Germany, that blew my mind. Did that not blow your mind?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Yeah, yeah.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: It blew my mind.\\n\\nAnd then, also, you know, now in this present moment that we are in, in this election, and having a clear understanding that the way folks in the dominant caste, the way that they vote, their choice of who they vote for is so determined not by what they feel would be better for the country but by their insistence on maintaining the caste system in America.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Mm-hmm. So, you know, this is a great segue to another clip that I wanted to show. In this scene, Wilkerson gets some pushback on her historical theory as she has it up to that point. Let's play this. We'll talk about it on the other side.\\n\\n[Video plays]\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: \\\"There is no number.\\\" And I wanted to show that because, if memory serves, it is after that conversation that she's having with those friends in Germany that she then goes down the road of investigating, and this is when she discovers that Nazis came to the United States to learn about the Jim Crow system and took it back there. And that's where the through line of caste from African Americans' experience with slavery and further experience in the United States, the Holocaust in Germany, and then the caste system in India, that that is where from that quote I read earlier, \\\"Caste is the bones.\\\"\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Mm-hmm. Yes, yes. Exactly.\\n\\nAnd, you know, one of the--some of the hardest work--I mean, you know, I have to say that when I watched that scene, I get a--I haven't seen the entire movie. So I've only seen clips, and I see these--see clips in this, in situations like this, where I want--you know, in front of other people. And when I have seen it, I personally--I have a personal reaction to that, and I watch her, Isabelle's reaction. And that would not have been my reaction at all.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I get angry. I get angry watching that. And I guess that's my character work that I had to do is because I had to respond in the way that Ms. Wilkerson would have responded, not in the way that I, Aunjanue Ellis, responded.\\n\\nAnd I have to say this. That was not Isabel--that was not Ms. Wilkerson's words. That was Ava DuVernay's words. And I think it's important--I think it's important to say that, because what Ava was inserting in that moment is this--is this, you know, numberless-ness. Right? That we can't--this number that we will never know, and one of the reasons why we will never know it is because the numbers keep going up. They keep going up. Police brutality in this country and Black people being murdered by the state, that number keeps going up.\\n\\nSitting in that library in Germany where that those conversations actually happened, and the Germans, in fact, the Nazis felt that they--some of the things that were--we were making--not we, but the Jim Crow South particularly were making happen, institutionalizing, they thought it was absurd; for example, intermarriage and endogamy. They said, \\\"There's no way in the world we can make this happen. This is ridiculous.\\\" Even they--even they said the links that the Jim Crow South particularly went to--they said, \\\"We can't do that. That's not possible to make happen here.\\\" It's stunning, and what's even more stunning is that we are not aware. We don't know this. We don't know this about ourselves.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Right. You know, how is it--please explain to me, as an actress, how you have not seen the movie in full. Is that something you do with all of your films or was making \\\"Origin\\\" so emotionally taxing and draining that you don't feel ready to see it in its entirety? Because I have to say, from the opening scene through the end, I am holding onto the--what do you call it?--the armrests in the theater, because it is that powerful from beginning to end. Is that the reason?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Well, I think for me personally as an actor, whatever I am, you know, it's hard for me to have an experience with something and then see it translated in another form, because it's something that I went through. It was something that I personally experienced. And then when it's--then when it's become--when it becomes something else, for someone else to hold, it's not mine anymore. And then it becomes--it becomes vulnerable to opinion, and I'm--I don't want to hear any of that. My own included. My own opinion, you know.\\n\\n[Laughter]\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: And \\\"Origin\\\" particularly was so personal for me. I went all over the world. I had experiences that changed me, and I don't want to bring my own judgment to that. I want that experience to be alive in me and cherished by me, and I want it to be unsullied. So yeah, that's why.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Wow. I can't--we've got to talk about how this movie got made because Ava DuVernay didn't go through the Hollywood system. Maybe the closest she came was going to Netflix who said, \\\"Hey, we want to do the film, just not in 2024.\\\" So what did she do? She went the philanthropic route, went to our buddy, Darren Walker, who's the president of the Ford Foundation and got the Ford Foundation to help finance it and individuals. What do you think--what kind of impact do you think that had on the film? Do you think not--in addition to allowing the film to be made, did it give Ava and you and the other folks in the cast, the freedom to make the movie that needed to be made?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I love when I do interviews with Ava and she says, \\\"We greenlit ourselves.\\\"\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: [Laughs]\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: I love it when she says that, you know?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Mm-hmm.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: That is how powerful, how powerful that is. She did this film outside of the studio system. She made it herself. She took a production all around the world. She did--she broke protocols. She often did not have permission, and I think that's a very meta thing, that she created this film without the permission of the Hollywood system, without their money, without any of it. And she created something, I think, hopefully for the ages, having done so.\\n\\nAnd the other part of it is she would not have been able to make the choices that she made. I likely would not have been in the film if it were a studio production, and the other folks that I worked with, maybe they wouldn't have been in the film as well. She was able to use her own--be her own boss in every way. She didn't have to answer to anyone but herself.\\n\\nYeah, I just--I'm so excited by that. It's a paradigm that she's breaking, and I hope that she continues that, and I hope others, other filmmakers will follow in line with that.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Well, I got a couple of questions on that. One, I find it surprising that you think if she'd gone through the Hollywood system, you wouldn't have been cast. I mean, you're an Oscar-nominated actress. You were nominated for the Oscar, for your role as Serena and Venus's mother--Williams in \\\"King Richard.\\\" So that, you know, to my layperson's eye, once you get an Academy Award nomination, you're put in this little bucket over here of people who, you know, go and get the phone calls. I can see the look on your face. You're like, \\\"Child, you don't have any idea what you're talking about.\\\"\\n\\n[Laughter]\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: But here's the key thing I'm trying to get to. Do you think the fact that you guys did greenlight yourself, that Ava did go outside the system, that she bucked the system, that that is one of the--one of the reasons why \\\"Origin\\\" got nary an Oscar nomination, not one?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Yeah. I mean, you know, it's over now so we can talk about it. Not only did it not get any Oscar nominations, outside of the Gotham Awards, it was not acknowledged or rewarded or awarded for any award. I don't know how else to say that. That was--that--whose organization or governing body or voting body was predominantly White. Not one.\\n\\nIt's over now, so I can say that, you know?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Uh-huh.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Thank God that we have been honored by the Image Awards and the African American Critics Association. They saw. They saw us, you know, to continue the--continue that, the title, the sentiment behind the title of when they see us, Ava's extraordinary work that was on about the Exonerated Five. Shout-out to Yusef Salaam, who's a New York City councilman right now.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Mm-hmm.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Yeah, they saw us. But somehow, you know, that community didn't.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: And you were in--you were in that show.\\n\\nDuring the protests over the murder of George Floyd, we saw lots of gestures made, lots of things said, lots of black squares on Instagram, lots of people doing--putting money behind a lot of things. And it seems like a lot of those--a lot of those things that happened have fallen by the wayside, have faded away, have been reversed. Do you think that even what Hollywood did during that time, were those just gestures, or have we seen even the tiniest bit of change in Hollywood? Or has it reverted back to type?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Well, you know, a couple things. First, I want to say I honor and acknowledge my colleagues and my coworkers who have been nominated, who were singled out and rightfully awarded for their tremendous work. So I want--I think both things can coexist. So I want to be clear about that.\\n\\nYou know, my response to that is I can't care. I can't care. You know, I cannot care. I mean, that's what Toni Morrison said. Right? And I live by this--or try to on my best days, anyway, is that, you know, that's what this stuff does. It's merely a distraction. It distracts you from your work. It makes you feel that what you have to do is defend your existence, defend your art. And while you're defending your existence, defending your art, guess what you're not doing? Is living and making your art.\\n\\nSo I can't care because that--I can't care because it keeps me from doing the work that I need to do. I mean, thank God, Ava didn't care, you know, and as a result of her not caring- or I'll put it like this. She didn't see that as a hurdle for her accomplishing what she achieved in \\\"Origin.\\\" She did it anyway. I mean, that's a very--that's a very Black church thing to say, doing it anyhow. Right?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Uh-huh. [Laughs]\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: That is what she did. We have to do it anyhow. Even when they don't care when they don't see us, we do it anyhow. Yeah.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Where can where can we see you next?\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Where can you see me next? Well, I'm going to say this. You know, I'm still--\\\"Origin\\\" might be in the theaters, maybe another couple weeks, and my goal with this film is to make strides in penetrating the conservative community. And one of those places particularly is organizations like Moms for Liberty. Organizations like Mom for Liberty were instrumental in banning the book, \\\"Caste,\\\" in places like libraries, like Texas, in Texas. And I feel that \\\"Origin\\\" being in the world, yes, it's great. I mean, the great thing about \\\"Origin\\\" is that we are having these discussions now about the caste system in this country. But the other part of that is what is standing in the way of our knowing that, of our awareness, and part of that is book banning. So I'm going to be doing work in that area to bring \\\"Origin\\\" and the book, \\\"Caste,\\\" again--it's already--that work is already done with the book, but bringing back that back to the forefront.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Whoo. Oscar-nominated actress Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, star of the movie \\\"Origin.\\\" This has been so much fun. You know, we've gotten three minutes overtime. I want to thank you--\\n\\n[Laughter]\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Yes, we have. I want to thank you so much.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Can I fan out two seconds? Can I fan out two seconds?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Oh, who am I to say no?\\n\\n[Laughter]\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: You're not. You are not.\\n\\nI saw you years ago at the--what's the New York Public Library, the award?\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: The LION Award.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Yes, yes, yes. I think Colson Whitehead might have been--might have been honored that night. Yeah. And you were at the--you were at the end of the table, and I was sitting right down. And I was like, oh, my God, there's Jonathan Capehart. So I didn't know until last night that you were going to interview me today, and I'm so excited. I'm so excited.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Oh, wow. Oh, wow.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Yes,\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Well, thank you very much for that, Aunjanue, and next time, come over and say hello. [Laughs]\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Okay. Done, done.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Great. This has been wonderful.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Thank you, Jonathan.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, thank you very much for coming to Washington Post Live.\\n\\nMS. ELLIS-TAYLOR: Thank you. Bye-Bye. Bye.\\n\\nMR. CAPEHART: And thank you for joining us.

      "            \"summary\": \"By\\n\\nWelcome back to Two-Night Minimum, a series of city guides for those who want to get to the heart of a place in a short time\\u2014be it on a business trip or a weekend vacation. For this Denver edition, we independently scoped out more than 90 venues and distilled the list down to the very best of the best: Every recommendation below has earned our most discerning stamp of approval.\\n\\nEver since its establishment as a gold rush town in the 1850s, Denver has been a city of transplants. Never has that been more evident than in recent years, with legions of work-from-anywhere types heeding its mile-high, Rocky Mountain-backed call of the wild.\\n\\nThese transplants\\u2014mostly millennials\\u2014have become the proxy architects of the city's fast-evolving neighborhoods.\\n\\nRetail businesses and restaurants, almost always in prefabricated, low-rise glass buildings, seem designed for social media with a cheery, photo-friendly patina; many are popular concepts brought in from their original hometowns, such as Brooklyn, New York, pizza icon Roberta's and Austin sushi stronghold Uchi. But if Denver feels at times like a generic catchall of Pan-American culture rather than its own distinct place, that's in the process of changing.\\n\\nThe city's economy is roaring as one of the fastest-growing in the nation, led by software development, financial services and aerospace technology. Denver International Airport, already one of the largest and busiest in the US, is forecasting passenger arrivals to climb from 69 million in 2019 to 100 million in the next decade. That will happen just as it completes a $1.3 billion expansion in 2028.\\n\\nWe've always thought Denver was worth visiting just so we could leave\\u2014typically, to explore the natural wonders of the American West. But it's no longer a base camp; it's a destination in its own right.\\n\\nTop Rooms in Town\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Ramble Hotel\\nAt the Ramble, rooms are decidedly Coloradan in theme, with a mod cowboy aesthetic: framed wildlife diagrams, plaid carpeting in the hallways and plenty of leather accents. But the vibe is most defined by the proudly flaunted Denver satellite of famed New York bar Death & Co, which takes over the parquet-and-concrete lobby's velvet sofas every evening. If you're hoping for a solid night's sleep, opt for a third-story room to put some distance between you and the late-night shenanigans on the ground level. Rates from $235\\n\\nSource: The Ramble Hotel\\n\\nFour Seasons Denver\\nThe predictability of Four Seasons' solid hospitality feels like a life preserver in a city where the hotel scene is too often characterized by slapdash hotel themes (Art! Baseball!), surprise resort fees and $9 lobby cappuccinos. The d\\u00e9cor is textbook 'international luxury' circa 2010 (think cherrywood and black lacquer accents), but the oversize rooms are immaculate, turndown service is seamless, and the on-site pool and spa are the perfect way to rescue tired limbs from a long day of hiking in the nearby mountains. Rates from $500\\n\\nSource: Four Seasons Denver\\n\\nBook It on Points\\nHotel Clio\\nA part of Marriott's Luxury Collection, Hotel Clio feels significantly more upscale than the other similarly priced hotels in Cherry Creek, Denver's bougie borough. Guarantee unobstructed views of the city and mountains by requesting a room on the seventh floor or higher. Rates from $270\\n\\nSource: Hotel Clio, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Denver Cherry Creek\\n\\nAll-Day Dining\\n\\nOur favorite restaurants for every meal\\n\\nDenver is dominated by mountains and microbrews. Locals start their free days with an eye toward the former\\u2014either skiing or hiking\\u2014and accordingly pack breakfasts to go. Brunch is big: Restaurants fill up first with people pouring in after exercise classes, then with mountaineers returning for a patio-side refuel. Late-afternoon beers are common antecedents to early suppers\\u20146:30 is prime time. As for post-dinner drinks? They only make sense when adventuring isn't on tomorrow's agenda.\\n\\n\\u25cf Noisette\\nMarried chefs Lillian and Tim Lu spent years working in the finest French kitchens in New York (including Daniel) before opening Noisette, their bakery and bistro in the LoHi (Lower Highland) neighborhood. Floor-to-ceiling windows pour ample sunlight across the dining room's Napoleonic banquettes, where you can have flaky pain au chocolates in the morning and savory lobster vol-au-vent at night, both impressive feats considering the recipe rejiggering needed for oven-work at altitude.\\n\\n\\u25cf Temaki Den & Reunion Bread\\nSushi in the landlocked Rockies seemed like an unappealing prospect until we had lunch at Temaki Den, a newer venture by esteemed chef Toshi Kizaki, who's been flying in his fish from Japan's Kyushu island daily for 40 years. Go for the three-roll temaki set\\u2014little nori cigars filled with tuna and blue crab. Then tack on a couple of orders of seared salmon oshizushi (like nigiri, but more tightly pressed into a brick shape). Bonus: Temaki Den practically shares a space with Reunion Bread \\u2014they're in the same corner of a vaulted shopping arcade\\u2014where you can order a spectacular pastel de nata for dessert.\\n\\n\\u25cf Cart-Driver\\nIt feels blasphemous to say that some of the best pizza in America is in a city more famous for an omelet, and even more outrageous to lavish praise on an oyster served more than a thousand miles from the ocean. But Cart-Driver pulls off the impossible, serving the perfect high-low meal of Neapolitan-style pies and a dozen Wellfleets with zingy mignonette. There are two branches; the one in RiNo (River North Art District) is more casual, with picnic tables in a stack of converted shipping containers, whereas the LoHi locale does full table service.\\n\\n\\u25cf No-Frills Dining on East Colfax\\nColfax Avenue, a seedy artery that tears across central Denver with its pawn shops, gas stations and pay-by-the-hour motels, doubles as the surprising home to some of the city's best unfussy eating. Start a food crawl at Bastien's Restaurant, a family-run institution where marbled steaks get seared with a proprietary sugar rub and slung to cowboy-hatted OGs. Then stop for Ukrainian bar bites including varenyky dumplings and piroshki meat pies at Molotov Kitschen + Cocktails \\u2014don't judge it by the name\\u2014before hopping a 10-minute Uber ride down the street to Mango House, a small food court of impressive international eats in an otherwise shuttered mall. Prioritize the fried samosas and tea leaf salad at Urban Burma.\\n\\u25cf Point Easy\\nWhen one of the chef-owners of Point Easy died less than a month after this Whittier neighborhood spot opened in 2022, it could've been curtains for the New American brasserie. But its knowledgeable and affable staff have stayed the course, turning it into what may be Denver's best restaurant. Although the menu rotates seasonally, our favorites dishes were rich, marsala-style mushroom toast; turnips lavished in vadouvan butter; and a surprisingly light, three-meat Bolognese topped with Parmesan confetti.\\n\\n\\u25cf Yacht Club\\nCrank up the Fiona Apple and dim the fairy lights at this irreverent, self-proclaimed dive bar, which feels like your older brother's dorm room. The cocktails are why you're here\\u2014mind-expanding mixed drinks with bold, untraditional flavors such as curry leaf and Old Bay. But everything's impeccably balanced, and there's canned Miller High Life and franks if you're not feeling spendy.\\n\\nOn the Town\\n\\nActivities to squeeze into any schedule\\n\\n\\u25cf Get Red on the Rocks\\nWhen it isn't teeming with concertgoers, Red Rocks Park & Amphitheatre moonlights (sunlights?) as a do-it-yourself outdoor exercising arena. Head there first thing in the morning for solo stair climbs or group yoga classes; the latter are organized by beloved local studios River Yoga and Buffalo & Sparrow. Come fall, the colosseum-shaped venue plays host to Fitness in the City's 'snow shape' classes, which get you ready for ski season. Or, if you're not into huffing and puffing at altitude, drive up the nearby Lariat Loop Trail for those TikTok-worthy mountain views from the top of the aptly named Lookout Mountain.\\n\\n\\u25cf Drink Like a Local\\nTrickling down from Colorado's iconic mountains is fresh alpine water\\u2014perfect for brewing beer. It's one reason patios and pale ales make up the backbone of Denver's apr\\u00e8s-anything culture. Try Cerebral Brewing, near City Park, for citrusy IPAs and laid-back vibes, or RiNo's supersocial Our Mutual Friend, where the small-batch selection runs from sours to stouts.\\n\\nBeyond hops there's the unexpected Colorado Sake Co., also in RiNo, which serves its own Japanese rice wine with tuna rolls and pork buns. The Family Jones, in LoHi, sells batched cocktails made with its own distilled whiskeys and ryes\\u2014you can take them home or enjoy them on-site in a midcentury-modern cocktail lounge, set inside a large glass-encased cube.\\n\\n\\u25cf Art in the West\\nHidden in an unassuming downtown office building just off Broadway, the American Museum of Western Art is a formerly private collection of paintings that's now open to the public on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. Its galleries showcase the diverse cultures and perspectives of the US frontier, from the expeditionary artists of the late 18th century to modern abstract expressionism. For a CliffsNotes tour, eye the ethnographic portraiture in Bay 3, then jump to the third floor for some of the finest works of the Taos School, which mainly produced landscapes and American Indian portraits\\u2014keep an eye out for Ernest L. Blumenschein's dreamlike depictions of New Mexico's desert mountains and its Indigenous inhabitants.\\n\\nFor a present-day take on art in the American West, visit the temporary exhibition spaces at MCA Denver. Past shows have repositioned the idea of the cowboy in popular culture and explored Georgia O'Keeffe's influence on contemporary American painting.\\n\\n\\u25cf An Interplanetary Adventure\\nA massive mashup of sci-fi and sculpture tucked between the concrete ribbons of a downtown highway interchange, Meow Wolf Denver, Conversion Station may be the city's best import: The interactive museum is an arcane spinoff of the original in Santa Fe, New Mexico. At this location, memories are recorded and traded as currency in a mazelike realm where four faraway planets have suddenly collided. Don't worry if you're confused\\u2014we didn't quite understand it either, but who cares! The Dr. Seuss-meets-Grateful Dead aesthetic, filled with buttons and levers that boop and boink,makes it the perfect place to drop your kids. For adults there's a futuristic bar meant to look like an airport lounge pulled from the year 3066.\\n\\nNeighborhoods to Know\\n\\nHalf-day guides to two areas you should hit: One central and one worth the (short) detour\\n\\n\\u25cf RiNo\\nMany of Denver's neighborhoods strive for a certain Nolita coolness with their funky coffee shops and cheekily abbreviated names\\u2014LoDo (Lower Downtown), LoHi (Lower Highland), etc. Of them all, the ultra-walkable River North Arts District, or RiNo, comes up trumps. Before taking on its of-the-moment boutiques, rewind the clock to the early 20th century, when the area was the city's hub of African American culture\\u2014the 'Harlem of the West.' A self-guided walking tour stretches five blocks along Welton Street, taking you past former jazz halls and the only drugstore soda fountain that allowed Black and White patrons to integrate before the advent of the Civil Rights Movement.\\n\\nNow it's Larimer Street, seven blocks away, that serves as RiNo's main artery, with its surplus of colorful street art and worthy gear shops. A stop at Carbon Knife Co can help you trick out your kitchen with handmade Japanese blades and collectible cookbooks; carry it all home in one of the sleek backpacks from Colorado-founded Topo Designs. There's good eating, too, be it a cortado and croissant at Hearth Bakery or snacks at the Denver Central Market. (The chocolate bonbons at Temper look like miniature works of postmodern art.) Leave room for lunch across the train tracks at Comal Heritage Food, a restaurant that doubles as a small-business incubator for immigrant and refugee women, who churn out homespun burritos and green chili stew.\\n\\n\\u25cf Aurora\\nYes, it's technically a separate city, but Aurora's manageable size and location, wedged between Denver and the international airport, make it a perfect stopover in between. Easily the most diverse corner of Colorado, Aurora is a beacon for new immigrants\\u2014more than 20% of the city's residents are foreign-born, and over 160 languages are spoken\\u2014which for visitors yields a panoply of international shopping and cuisine.\\n\\nStart with a snack at B\\u00e1nh & Butter, which can go in one of two wildly different directions\\u2014be it a b\\u00e1nh m\\u00ec stuffed with fresh cilantro and jalape\\u00f1o or a vanilla br\\u00fbl\\u00e9e 'cruffin' (a croissant-muffin mashup). Either is a great precursor to a flight of small-batch apple ales, handmade by the warmhearted husband-and-wife owners of Haykin Family Cider. For dinner, Annette has garnered a fiercely loyal following for its seasonal mains; it was the effortlessly cool service and even better double-fried frites that won us over.\\n\\nGet a dose of adventure on your drive in or out with a 25-minute detour through the 15,000-acre Rocky Mountain Arsenal National Wildlife Refuge, a wartime munitions test site-turned-bison reserve. Or you can rocket into the air on a flight simulator at Wings Over the Rockies, an aerospace museum in a former US Air Force hangar.\\n\\nExtend Your Trip\\n\\nAdventures beyond the city limits\\n\\nBoulder\\u2014equal parts mountain- and college town\\u2014nuzzles up against the ridges of the Rockies, just 30 miles northwest of big sibling Denver. But with scores of mom and pop shops, trendsetting restaurants and a dozen incredible hikes with trailheads in the middle of town, it's worth two nights all on its own.\\n\\nStay at one of the 60 historic cottages that make up Colorado Chautauqua \\u2014a relic of the utopian late-19th century movement that brought education and entertainment to rural locales. Now functioning as more of a hotel, it's a perfect gateway for hikes around the Flatiron foothills, with a shared dining hall that serves Swedish-style pancakes at breakfast. Do as the locals and hoof it to the outskirts of town to pack a picnic lunch of artisanal charcuterie from Blackbelly before hitting the trails\\u2014or snag a frothy, turmeric-whipped Golden Milk latte from the Boulder Dushanbe Teahouse, an arabesque pavilion originally built in Tajikistan and shipped to downtown Boulder as individual pieces of timber.\\n\\nThere are three most worthy stops on Pearl Street, Boulder's main commercial thoroughfare. The New Local is a gallery and studio space supporting female artists; menswear shop Canoe Club features cutting-edge international labels; then there's Colorado's original fine-dining outpost, Frasca Food & Wine, which is ideal for a celebration. Its prix fixe menu, inspired by Alpine Italy, includes indulgences such as truffled scallops and a deeply rich, wild-herb brodo. With enough planning (figure four to six weeks), you can even nab the singular chef's table, located right in the kitchen.\\n\\n\\n\\nA final tip before you're on your way\\n\\nAsk any Coloradan: The best way to earn your cred as a local is to summit all 58 of the state's so-called 14ers\\u2014mountains with a peak higher than 14,000 feet. (Most people climb a few and say they'll 'eventually' tackle the others.) The two perfect ascents to cut your teeth are Grays Peak and Torreys Peak. They're both located about an hour west of Denver, with 7.5-mile hikes, summits just below 14,300 feet and some 3,000 feet of total elevation. Check out 14ers.com for detailed information; the ideal time to climb is from June to early October.\\n\\nRead next: Two-Night Minimum: Madrid\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"This is a \\nKFF Health News story.\\nIn late 2022, Sarah Gutilla's treatment-resistant depression had grown so severe, she was actively contemplating suicide. Raised in foster care, the 34-year-old's childhood was marked by physical violence, sexual abuse, and drug use, leaving her with life-threatening mental scars.\\nOut of desperation, her husband scraped together $600 for the first of six rounds of intravenous ketamine therapy at Ketamine Clinics Los Angeles, which administers the generic anesthetic for off-label uses such as treating depression. When Gutilla got into an Uber for the 75-mile drive to Los Angeles, it was the first time she had left her home in Llano, California, in two years. The results, she said, were instant.\\n\\\"The amount of relief I felt after the first treatment was what I think 'normal' is supposed to feel like,\\\" she said. \\\"I've never felt so OK, and so at peace.\\\"\\nFor-profit ketamine clinics have proliferated over the past few years, offering infusions for a wide array of mental health issues, including obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and anxiety. Although the off-label use of ketamine hydrochloride, a Schedule III drug approved by the FDA as an anesthetic in 1970, was considered radical just a decade ago, now between \\n500 and 750 ketamine clinics\\n have cropped up across the nation.\\nMarket researcher Grand View Research pegged industry revenues at $3.1 billion in 2022, and projects them to more than double to $6.9 billion by 2030. Most insurance doesn't cover ketamine for mental health, so patients must pay out-of-pocket.\\nWhile it's legal for doctors to prescribe ketamine, the FDA hasn't approved it for mental health treatment, which means that individual practitioners must develop their own treatment protocols. The result is wide variability among providers, with some favoring gradual, low-dosage treatments while others advocate larger amounts that can induce hallucinations, as the drug is psychedelic at the right doses.\\nA vial of Ketamine, Nov. 14, 2022 in Boulder, Colo.\\nMedianews Group/The Denver Post via Getty Images\\n\\\"Ketamine is the wild West,\\\" said Dustin Robinson, the managing principal of Iter Investments, a venture capital firm specializing in hallucinogenic drug treatments.\\nKetamine practitioners stress that the drug's emergence as a mental health treatment is driven by a desperate need. Depression is the \\nleading cause of disability\\n in the United States for individuals ages 15-44, according to the National Institute of Mental Health, and \\naround 25% of adults\\n experience a diagnosable mental disorder in any given year.\\nMeanwhile, many insurance plans cover mental health services at lower rates than physical health care, \\ndespite laws requiring parity\\n. Thus many patients with disorders receive little or no care early on and are desperate by the time they visit a ketamine clinic, said \\nSteven Siegel\\n, chair of psychiatry and the behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine.\\nBut the revelation that \\n\\\"Friends\\\" star Matthew Perry\\n died in part from a large dose of ketamine, along with \\nbillionaire Elon Musk's open use of the drug\\n, has piqued fresh scrutiny of ketamine and its regulatory environment, or lack thereof.\\nCommercial ketamine clinics often offer same-day appointments, in which patients can pay out-of-pocket for a drug that renders immediate results. The ketamine is administered intravenously, and patients are often given blankets, headphones, and an eye mask to heighten the dissociative feeling of not being in one's body. A typical dose of ketamine to treat depression, which is 10 times lower than the dosage used in anesthesia, costs clinics about $1, but clinics charge $600-$1,000 per treatment.\\nKetamine is still shadowed by its reputation as the party drug known as \\\"Special K\\\"; Siegel's first grant from the National Institutes of Health was to study ketamine as a drug of abuse. It has the potential to send users down a \\\"K hole,\\\" otherwise known as a bad trip, and can induce psychosis. Research in animals and \\nrecreational users\\n has shown chronic use of the drug impairs both short- and long-term cognition.\\nPerry's death in October raised alarms when the initial toxicology screening attributed his death to the acute effects of ketamine. A December report revealed Perry received infusion therapy a week before his death but that the fatal blow was a high dose of the substance taken with an opioid and a sedative on the day of his death \\u2014 indicating that medical ketamine was not to blame.\\nA variety of protocols\\nSam Mandel co-founded Ketamine Clinics Los Angeles in 2014 with his father, Steven Mandel, an anesthesiologist with a background in clinical psychology, and Sam said the clinic has established its own protocol. That includes monitoring a patient's vital signs during treatment and keeping psychiatrists and other mental health practitioners on standby to ensure safety. Initial treatment starts with a low dose and increases as needed.\\nWhile many clinics follow the Mandels' graduated approach, the dosing protocol at MY Self Wellness, a ketamine clinic in Bonita Springs, Florida, is geared toward triggering a psychedelic episode.\\nChristina Thomas, president of MY Self Wellness, said she developed her clinic's procedures against a list of \\\"what not to do\\\" based on the bad experiences people have reported at other clinics.\\nThe field isn't entirely unregulated: State medical and nursing boards oversee physicians and nurses, while the FDA and Drug Enforcement Administration regulate ketamine. But most anesthesiologists don't have a background in mental health, while psychiatrists don't know much about anesthesia, Sam Mandel noted. He said a collaborative, multidisciplinary approach is needed to develop standards across the field, particularly because ketamine can affect vital signs such as blood pressure and respiration.\\nThe protocols governing Spravato, an FDA-approved medication based on a close chemical cousin of ketamine called esketamine, are illustrative. Because it has the potential for serious side effects, it falls under the FDA's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies program, which puts extra requirements in place, said Robinson. Spravato's REMS requires two hours of monitoring after each dose and prohibits patients from driving on treatment days.\\nGeneric ketamine, by contrast, has no REMS requirements. And because it is generic and cheap, drugmakers have little financial incentive to undertake the costly clinical trials that would be required for FDA approval.\\nThat leaves it to the patient to assess ketamine providers. Clinics dedicated to intravenous infusions, rather than offering the treatment as an add-on, may be more familiar with the nuances of administering the drug. Ideally, practitioners should have mental health and anesthesia expertise, or have multiple specialties under one roof, and clinics should be equipped with hospital-grade monitoring equipment, Mandel said.\\nSiegel, who has researched ketamine since 2003, said the drug is especially useful as an emergency intervention, abating suicidal thoughts for long enough to give traditional treatments, like talk therapy and SSRI antidepressants, time to take effect. \\\"The solutions that we have and have had up until now have failed us,\\\" Mandel said.\\nThe drug is now popular enough as a mental health treatment that the name of Mandel's clinic is a daily sight for thousands of Angelenos as it appears on 26 Adopt-A-Highway signs along the 405 and 10 freeways.\\nAnd the \\npsychedelic renaissance in mental health\\n is accelerating. A drug containing MDMA, known as ecstasy or molly, is expected to receive FDA approval in 2024. A drug with psilocybin, the active ingredient in \\\"magic mushrooms,\\\" could launch as early as 2027, the same year a stroke medicine with the active ingredient of DMT, a hallucinogen, is expected to debut.\\nRobinson said many ketamine clinics have opened in anticipation of the expanded psychedelic market. Since these new drugs will likely be covered by insurance, Robinson advises clinics to offer FDA-approved treatments such as Spravato so they'll have the proper insurance infrastructure and staff in place.\\nFor now, Sarah Gutilla will pay out-of-pocket for ketamine treatments.

      "            \"summary\": \"A purple daikon radish grown at Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo. and other vegetables are prepared to be served at a meeting to discuss support for small Colorado farmers in December.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. \\n \\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colorado \\u2013 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.\\n \\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.\\n \\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n \\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Guttridge, farmer and co-owner at Ollin Farms, feeds the chickens. The farm benefits from a county program that helps small growers get their produce to more people.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n \\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n \\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n \\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2013 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2013 many of mixed immigration status \\u2013 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \\n \\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n \\nWin, win, win\\n \\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \\n \\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains. \\n \\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \\n \\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n \\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \\n \\nA force for good\\n \\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n \\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n \\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n \\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \\n \\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n \\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2013 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.\\n \\nPhotography by Rachel Woolf.

They see you as the mistress. They see you as the housekeeper. They see you as not the leading lady, so that's why it feels so good to not only be a leading lady, but to have Quinta,\\\" Winfrey said, in reference to \\\"Abbott Elementary\\\" creator and Ralph's co-star Quinta Brunson. \\\"What does that feel like for you sitting in that seat? Being able to have that young woman \\u2026 orchestrate all of this?\\\"\\n\\n\\\"It says that every boulder that had to be moved, every hurdle that had to be jumped over, every time I had to use my voice to speak out for more for women in general, but especially for Black women who were being shut out just because of the color of their skin,\\\" Ralph said in the exclusive clip shared with USA TODAY. \\\"When I look at Quinta, who are looking at her and I said, 'That's my child right there.' And I see my child coming up over the mountain. And I'm like, 'Yes, here we are.'\\\"\\n\\nSheryl Lee Ralph (left) opened up with Oprah Winfrey in a new special, \\\"'The Life You Want' Class: A Conversation with Sheryl Lee Ralph.\\\"\\n\\nRalph's career has gotten a second wind since she began starring as the tough-as-nails kindergarten teacher Barbara Howard on \\\"Abbott\\\" in 2021. The series, which became a ratings hit for ABC, will return with its third season on Feb. 7. Last year, she won outstanding supporting actress in a comedy series for her performance in \\\"Abbott Elementary\\\" at the 74th Primetime Emmy Awards, the first Black woman to win the category in 35 years.\\n\\nRalph also shared an interesting royal connection during her interview with Winfrey involving her aunt, Carolyn, who was a teacher at Bunker Hill Elementary School in Washington, D.C.\\n\\n\\\"She had the audacity to believe that her students could have more, that they shouldn't be judged by their zip code, so she invited the queen of England to come to her school and the queen came twice, so that's my Barbara Howard spirit,\\\" Ralph said in front of a New York City audience.\\n\\n\\\"The person that is so committed to her job to her students that she will not give up, just because others might have, because of where they live and where they come from so thank you,\\\" Ralph continued.\\n\\nWhile the actress stays busy booking roles in Hollywood, she stays bonded to her family. The actress and activist, who is married to Pennsylvania state legislator Vincent Hughes, is a mom of two adult children. Her son, Etienne Maurice is a filmmaker, actor and activist while her daughter, Ivy, serves as Ralph's personal stylist.\\n\\nThe full conversation between Ralph and Winfrey airs Wednesday on Oprah Daily.\\n\\nThis article originally appeared on USA TODAY: Oprah, Sheryl Lee Ralph talk Robert De Niro advice, 'Abbott Elementary\",\n",

LeVision's three invalidity challenges to the RealD 3D\\u00ae dual-beam and the three-beam optical system patents were all rejected, confirming in full the validity and integrity of the invention patents of RealD 3D\\u00ae projection system in China.\\n\\nRealD's three Chinese invention patents are ZL201310233906.3, ZL201480000777.6, and ZL201710333855.X.\\n\\nThese patent challenges are the second time an individual or company has filed an invalidation request against patents owned by RealD 3D\\u00ae regarding their three-beam optical technology in China. All requests to date were denied.\\n\\nThis victory is also the latest case upholding and affirming RealD's patented technology in the world. In 2018, the European Patent Office (EPO) rejected both Volfoni and MasterImage's European patent invalidation challenges against RealD, and the validity, scope, and rights of RealD 3D\\u00ae system remained unchanged. Prior to this, RealD 3D\\u00ae was also challenged by patent invalidation challenges in jurisdictions such as the United States, Japan, Australia, and Russia, and these were rejected by local judicial and patent authorities. RealD's invention patent rights on this technology have been maintained and reconfirmed time and time again.\\n\\nIn addition to maintaining the validity of the entire patent rights, RealD has also won verdicts of patent infringement against MasterImage, Volfoni, and DepthQ in both US and German courts over the past ten years.\\n\\n\\\"The success of these cases underscores the third-party recognition of the quality and value of our patents. They also reaffirmed the intellectual property behind RealD's technology,\\\" said Travis Reid, CEO and President of Worldwide Cinema of RealD.\\n\\n\\\"RealD employs world-class inventors and invests substantial resources in our mission to deliver the perfect visual image. In order to continue this commitment and invest in R&D, we must hold infringers accountable for copying RealD's patented technology and protect our R&D and existing patented technologies,\\\" Reid said.\\n\\nRealD's China subsidiary company was founded in 2010. \\\"In the past ten years, we have established offices in Beijing, Shanghai, and Hong Kong, and in 2017, we established a Support Center in Shanghai to engage in product development and maintenance and gradually move the production base of 3D equipment to China. Along the way, we have built strong relationships with many cinema chains and cinemas, and together, we have brought better cinema experiences to moviegoers across China. The key to our business and partnership is the continuous research and development and the protection of our intellectual property rights,\\\" said Edman Chan, Vice President and General Manager, Asia Pacific of RealD.\\n\\nSince its introduction, the RealD 3D system has become the world's most widely used cinema 3D projection technology. RealD's patented technology delivers nearly double the light efficiency compared to other 3D systems, presenting brighter, better 3D images. Since 2006, RealD has established a strong patent barrier for 3D systems with nearly double the light efficiency. The intellectual property rights obtained by RealD cover the hardware structure, hardware design, and many inventive technologies of the system, and it has a total of more than 470 invention patents in countries or regions around the world, including China.\\n\\n RealD Inc.\\n\\nNamed three times as \\\"Most Innovative Company\\\" by Fast Company, RealD's mission is to perfect the visual experience on every screen and on every device. RealD pioneered digital 3D cinema and today has the world's largest 3D cinema platform with well over 2 billion people having experienced a movie in RealD 3D. RealD's network of theaters includes more than 30,000 installed screens in 75 countries with over 1,200 exhibition partners. As the world's premier visual technology innovator, RealD designs and licenses cutting-edge technologies that enable a premium viewing experience in the theater and on mobile and personal devices.\\n\\nRealD has offices in Beverly Hills, Boulder, London, Moscow, Shanghai, Beijing, Hong Kong and Tokyo.

While subscriber preferences are ever-evolving, subscriptions themselves remain firmly planted within daily routines.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe median trial-to-paid conversion rate was 50%, measuring the proportion of trial users who transition into paying subscribers, confirming consumers still favor trials.\\n\\n\\nThe median signup success rate stood at 89%, which measures the percentage of initial subscription transactions that were approved. This metric is significant, as it reflects the effectiveness of the checkout process and backend payment processing.\\n\\n\\nOver the past year, Recurly saw a 16% increase in active subscribers and when comparing this to 2020, growth surges to 105%.\\n\\n\\n2. Brands build relationships\\u2014attention moves to the most profitable subscribers. \\nRecovery events, defined as instances where technology actively prevents involuntary churn, have become key in preserving subscriber relationships. For instance, the renewal invoice paid rate, the percentage of all renewal invoices that are paid in their final state, came in at 96% in 2023.\\n\\n\\nThe median churn rate across all industries was 4%, staying consistent year-over-year.\\n\\n\\nRecurly saved 72% of at-risk subscribers using recovery events, extending their subscription by a median of 141 days, with 38% of a subscriber's total lifetime happening after a recovery event.\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, Recurly recovered \\n$1.2 billion\\n in subscription revenue through its churn management solutions using a full array of strategies, combining years of transactional data to feed AI-powered transaction retry models to predict and recover potentially lost revenue.\\n\\n\\n\\\"Recurly is excited to announce a major new platform feature, built-in benchmarks, available to all customers. It is an essential addition that allows our customers to directly compare key performance metrics against similar businesses within their industry. This will offer a clear view of where they stand in the competitive subscription landscape over specific timelines,\\\" says Rohrlich.\\n \\nBuilt-in benchmarks\\n\\u00a0will be part of two new dashboards: renewal invoice paid rate and renewal invoice decline rate. Additional benchmarking metrics will be added in the coming months and will deliver comprehensive insights across subscriber acquisition and retention to help Recurly customers better gauge the health of their subscription businesses.\\n3. Personalization is underutilized\\u2014unique subscription offers boost loyalty.\\nAn exceptional subscriber experience grants subscribers co-ownership, enabling them to create a subscription that aligns with their specific needs while allowing for future adjustments. The ability to personalize the subscription offer (plan length, product, price, payment, and promotion) at scale can boost both revenues and relationships.\\n\\n\\nIn 2023, 28% of Recurly customers offered plan customizations to allow subscribers to personalize their subscriptions, resulting in \\n$2.2 billion\\n in incremental revenue.\\n\\n\\nFrom 2020 to 2023, incremental revenue from product add-ons increased by 272% for Recurly customers utilizing the feature.\\n\\n\\nThe subscription pause feature gives subscribers the ability to temporarily suspend the subscription. In 2023, 40% of Recurly customers enabled pause, demonstrating the widespread adoption of this feature to prevent cancellations.\\n\\n\\n4. Payment types impact the subscriber experience\\u2014improving the convenience and likelihood of successful payments.\\nPayments drive the subscriber experience and establish the framework for preferred payment methods, affordability considerations, and subscription payment success.\\n\\n\\nThe most popular payment method was debit cards, accounting for 46% of global transactions in Recurly. Both debit and credit cards have grown in popularity since 2020.\\n\\n\\nAlthough alternative payment methods (APMs) make up a small percentage of total transactions, their significance is indisputable. While PayPal only made up 19% of total transactions in Recurly in 2023, 45% of respondents in our \\nsurvey\\n cited PayPal as their preferred payment method, followed by credit cards (39%) and ACH, debit, and checking account withdrawal (23%).\\n\\n\\nAPMs presented a significantly lower risk of \\nfraud\\n (<1%) when compared to credit (17%) and debit cards (11%) last year, as many APMs offer additional security measures that benefit both businesses and consumers.\\n\\n\\nAdditional insights\\u2014including benchmarks by industry\\u2014are included in the report.

      "            \"summary\": \"A new study shows taxes on sugary beverages like soda reduce demand and are likely to improve public health.\\nSoda is the No. 1 source of added sugar in the American diet. Aside from the tooth decay your mother warned you about, soda and sugar-sweetened tea, fruit, and sports drinks and their added calories increase insulin resistance, obesity, and the risks of diabetes, heart disease, liver cancer, and other chronic disease, research shows.\\u00a0\\nThat's in part because sugary beverages have little nutritional value, and sugar in its liquid form can be especially unhealthy because it is so rapidly absorbed into the blood.\\u00a0In a 2019 study of 10 European countries, sugary beverage consumption increased the risk of premature death across all diseases and complications.\\nTo combat the crisis, dozens of countries have taxed the beverages, and though opposition from the American beverage industry is formidable,\\u00a0a handful of U.S. locales have followed suit.\\u00a0\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Michael Long \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n'Tax and price change gets you to look at your habits and think again, \\u2018Is this what I want to be doing?'\\u00a0' says Michael Long, SD, an associate professor of prevention and community health at George Washington University.\\n \\nThat's just how it's designed, Long says. As with tobacco, alcohol, or cannabis, the higher shelf price signals to shoppers that sugary drinks come with a cost to society.\\u00a0\\nThe new study in \\nThe Journal of the American Medical Association\\n found sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) taxes in five U.S. cities raised soda prices by an average of 33% \\u2013 roughly $1 per 6-pack \\u2013 leading to a 33% drop in sales, and shoppers typically did not leave their cities to buy the drinks elsewhere. (The study looked at data from Boulder, CO; Oakland, CA; Philadelphia; San Francisco; and Seattle.)\\n'This impact was sustained,' says Lisa Powell, PhD, a distinguished professor of health policy and administration at the University of Illinois Chicago. 'That's a very large change in behavior.'\\u00a0\\nStill, widespread adoption of the taxes has been elusive. Only the Navajo Nation and the five cities in the study \\u2013 along with Albany, CA; Berkeley, CA; Cook County, IL; and Washington, DC \\u2013 have levied some form of tax on sugary drinks. Cook County later repealed its tax. Some states, including Arizona and Michigan, have blocked such taxes, while California and Washington have prohibited cities from levying further taxes.\\nA national tax seems even more elusive, despite a 2015 study by Long and others predicting a penny-per-ounce national SSB tax would cost little and generate more than $12.5 billion in tax revenue and $23.6 billion in health care savings over a decade, while increasing healthy life expectancy. (Studies in 2012 and 2019 forecast similar results.)\\nSince 2009 \\u2013 when the industry successfully fought the Obama administration's proposed SSB excise tax \\u2013 beverage companies have spent tens of millions on lobbying efforts. They've spent more on campaigns to shift blame for the obesity epidemic away from their products, according to a 2018 study in the \\nYale Journal of Biology and Medicine\\n.\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n Lisa Powell, PhD \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOne of the industry's favorite arguments is that SSB taxes kill jobs. But Powell says only industry-funded studies have reached that conclusion. Non-industry-funded, peer-reviewed studies have found 'no net negative impacts on employment,' she says.\\nPowell likened it to when people stopped listening to CDs. Jobs were lost in that product sector, she says, but music streaming services created new ones.\\u00a0\\nConfronted with an SSB tax, consumers often buy untaxed drinks made by the same beverage companies, Powell says, or they spend savings on other goods and services \\u2013 not to mention the economic activity generated by the government spending newfound revenue.\\n'Preferences change all the time,' she says. 'The money doesn't disappear from the economy.'\\u00a0\\n \\nAnother industry argument is that SSB taxes hit the poor harder.\\u00a0Powell and Long counter that.\\u00a0\\nClearly, lower-income households consume more soda and are more responsive to price changes, they say. But that's kind of the point: Families that quit buying sugary drinks stand to save money at the grocery store \\u2013 and the doctor's office, Long says.\\u00a0\\nBeverage companies market dangerously unhealthy drinks and are 'putting them everywhere,' even schools and hospitals, Long says. Far from being some sinister plan of 'the nanny state,' SSB taxes are a form of appropriate regulation, he says.\\n'We do need the government to help us achieve our goals as a people and community. The idea we can thrive as a people without any form of collective action is wrong,' Long says.\\u00a0\\nPowell concurs. The key takeaway for January's study is that SSB taxes are 'an effective tool for reducing demand,' she says. An excise tax of 1 to 2 cents per ounce would be most effective at a federal level, she says.\\n \\n\\\"At the end of the day, we have a policy tool that we know is effective in the interest of national public health,' Powell says.\\u00a0\\n'The broader the jurisdiction, the better.'\",\n",

In a release obtained first by CBS News Colorado, the families of the people murdered in the shooting on March 22, 2021, allege the Colorado Healing Fund \\u2013 a nonprofit organization \\u2013 has continued to hold onto donated money the fund collected from generous Coloradans.\\n\\nDespite signing on to a letter in November 2023 demanding more transparency from the Healing Fund, the families say \\\"nothing changed.\\\"\\n\\n\\\"As recently as last month, after asking the Colorado Healing Fund the simplest of questions, the nonprofit has continued to stonewall us, unwilling to answer: How much is currently in the Boulder fund? Who is the treasurer of the Colorado Healing Fund? Who has the power to release financial statements to us? Must a board meeting take place in order to stop the diversion of Boulder funds elsewhere? When is your next board meeting? May our families address the board?\\\" the families wrote in Thursday's release. \\\"A real-time bank balance for the Boulder fund should not be difficult to provide if the nonprofit's accounting is in order.\\\"\\n\\nThe families also expressed concerns that the Healing Fund has refused to release a copy of its audits pertaining to how the donated funds were spent.\\n\\n\\\"We demand that donations collected for us in the wake of this unspeakable tragedy to stop being diverted from us,\\\" the families said in Thursday's release. \\\"We should never have been put in a position by this nonprofit or the state of CO.

Our percentage is closer to 5%.\\\"\\n\\nMcFatridge also said in November, \\\"The Colorado Healing Fund is audited by an outside accounting firm every year, and we account for every penny we receive.\\\"\\n\\nIn Thursday's release, the families of those murdered in the Boulder grocery store shooting alleged the Healing Fund's actions have had detrimental effects. They would like to see state leaders hold nonprofits like the Healing Fund accountable for how donated funds are spent.\\n\\n\\\"We are still grieving,\\\" they wrote. \\\"The Colorado Healing Fund has re-victimized us and the state of CO is allowing to them to continue to re-victimize us.\\\"\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"LOADING\\n\\nAsk any travel expert why they got into the business, and they'll likely be quick to shout out a specific destination that stole their heart. Maybe it was the incredible food, the lively arts scene, or the picturesque views that won them over and made them think, I'd like to do this for a living.\\n\\nWhile the options are seemingly endless, especially for people who do it for a living, everyone secretly has that one spot that trumps the rest. We asked six travel experts to weigh in on the places that made them fall in love with travel.\\n\\nHere's what they said:\\n\\nNorthern Italy\\n\\nSarah Marston Crocker, the founder and owner of Pathways Active Travel in Boulder, Colorado, grew up hiking hut to hut in the Swiss Alps with her family. But it wasn't until 2016, when she was between jobs, that a trip to Northern Italy propelled her into the travel industry.\\n\\nThe idea for her active travel company was born on a rocky, rugged hiking trail, the Alta Via 2, in the heart of the Dolomites, a mountain range in the northern Italian Alps.\\n\\n'We had just ascended up to the highest point on the Alta Via 2 and were enjoying a nice gentle traverse while taking in the panorama as we made our way towards Passo Pordoi and closer views of the Marmolada Glacier,' Crocker told HuffPost.\\n\\nNext, Crocker visited Madonna di Campiglio, a small ski town, and was blown away by how beautiful and accessible this area of the Dolomites was. The visit solidified her desire to create Pathways and share this type of memorable hiking experience with others.\\n\\n'I fell in love with this place and these mountains \\u2014 and with the friendly, warm people, the culture and the incredible food,' she said.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nEmma Lasiuk visited Costa Rica in her junior year of college to volunteer near Manuel Antonio. She fell in love with the country's lush green fauna, deep blue sea and pink and orange sunsets. The local people, or 'Ticos' as they proudly call themselves, won her heart next.\\n\\n'I had traveled extensively before visiting here but had never felt so warmly welcomed and safe,' said Lasiuk, now a travel consultant with Costa Rican Vacations. She embraced the Pura Vida lifestyle, filling her days with hikes, early-morning beach swims and wildlife spotting.\\n\\nWhen it was time to return to the United States, she was terrified that Costa Rica would fade to a memory \\u2014 so much so that she instantly booked another trip and eventually moved there full-time.\\n\\n'There is something for everyone in Costa Rica, whether it be zip lining above the treetops in La Fortuna, swaying on hanging bridges in the dense cloud forest of Monteverde, jumping off waterfalls in the deep jungles of Manuel Antonio or diving off the Central Pacific coast at Ca\\u00f1o Island,' she said. 'I cannot see myself living anywhere else.'\\n\\nMississippi\\n\\nMadison Ned Butler, communications manager with the Rail Passengers Association, has seen most of the country through their long-distance train travels, but one destination in the South stood out.\\n\\n'Mississippi is beautiful, complicated, joyous, bold and friendly,' they told HuffPost. In 2019, Butler spent a week and a half traversing the Gulf Coast and exploring the Delta, in awe of the state's culture and communities.\\n\\n'The food, music, and art scenes are phenomenal right now. I've seen brilliant emerging talent from the state that has already produced many of our most acclaimed artists,' Butler said.\\n\\nPerhaps their favorite part was visiting the various historical sites and museums, including the Mississippi Freedom Trail and the Civil Rights Museum in nearby Memphis, Tennessee.\\n\\n'There is a feeling of hopeful change with a recognition of history's tragedies that I think is very conscious and beautiful,' Butler said. 'I think everyone that lives in the U.S. should visit these sites and take that history in for themselves.'\\n\\nIreland\\n\\nIn 2006, Stephanie Chastain and her husband were looking for a destination for their honeymoon. Chastain had never traveled internationally. They chose Ireland because they'd heard great things about the scenery and history.\\n\\nChastain, now the founder of Infinite Ireland Travel Co., told HuffPost she 'was a goner' from the moment she stepped off the plane. She was most looking forward to the iconic sites like the Cliffs of Moher and Killarney National Park \\u2015 and while they were spectacular, it was the people and the local sites that wound up being the most memorable for her.\\n\\nShe and her husband spent their days weaving though mom-and-pop shops, visiting old, tiny pubs, and stumbling on hidden gems that weren't in their guidebooks, such as the 300 A.D. stone fort sitting in the middle of a farmer's field.\\n\\nAfter that trip, and a few return visits, Chastain decided to help others experience authentic, local Ireland. People who travel to Ireland often try to zip around to all the iconic sites; Chastain encourages people to go at a slower pace so they have time to meet the local people, meander through lesser-known spots, and leave room for adventure.\\n\\nTaiwan\\n\\nNick Kembel, a travel photographer and writer, first visited Taiwan because he was curious to learn about a new destination. He immediately felt welcomed \\u2014 he said locals help people navigate around and provide tips on cheap eats.\\n\\n'They'll insist you try their grandma's secret soup dumplings, or point you toward hidden night market stalls that only locals know about,' Kembel said.\\n\\nWhat sealed the deal for him, though, was the nature. 'From the peaceful Sun Moon Lake to the dramatic Taroko Gorge, every landscape told stories, and hiking was seeing more magic,' Kembel said.\\n\\nPetrified Forest National Park, Arizona\\n\\nChiara Salvadori via Getty Images\\n\\nYears ago, Jim Pattiz, a nature filmmaker and co-founder of the organization More Than Just Parks, took a spur-of-the-moment summer road trip from his home in Atlanta to the Grand Canyon. It ended up changing the course of his life. Pattiz and his crew borrowed his grandmother's Prius and drove straight through to New Mexico, followed by a visit to Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona.\\n\\n'Having grown up in Georgia, all I knew were woods and streams, but here you could see beautiful summer storms rolling in miles and miles off in the distance,' Pattiz told HuffPost.\\n\\nHe recalls the blue mesas, the striped hills and, of course, the petrified wood. The vastness of it all awakened his senses, he says, and everything suddenly seemed so exciting and possible.\\n\\n'That feeling of enchantment and wide open possibilities is one I've chased ever since in my travels all across America's public lands,' he said.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"HANOVER, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Utz Brands, Inc. (NYSE: UTZ) ('Utz' or the 'Company'), a leading U.S. manufacturer of branded salty snacks, today announced that certain of its subsidiaries including Utz Quality Foods, LLC have entered into a definitive agreement for the sale of certain assets and brands to Our Home\\u2122, an operating company of Better-for-You brands that includes Real Food From the Ground Up\\u00ae, Popchips\\u00ae, and Food Should Taste Good\\u00ae ('Our Home'). Under the agreement, affiliates of Our Home have agreed to purchase the Good Health\\u00ae and R.W. Garcia\\u00ae brands, the Lincolnton, NC, and Lititz, PA manufacturing facilities and certain related assets, and assume the Company's Las Vegas, NV facility's lease and manufacturing operations.\\n\\nFollowing the close of the transactions, Utz and Our Home will operate under a Transition Services Agreement for 12 months. The total consideration for the transactions is $182.5 million, subject to customary adjustments, and the transactions are expected to close on February 5, 2024. In addition, post-closing, the parties will operate under reciprocal co-manufacturing agreements under which Our Home will co-manufacture certain Utz products and Utz will co-manufacture certain Good Health\\u00ae products. Certain Good Health\\u00ae products will continue to be distributed and sold on the Utz DSD network for Our Home. Our Home plans to continue to operate and grow the brands and manufacturing facilities under its platform while offering employment to Utz associates working in those facilities as part of the transition.\\n\\nHoward Friedman, Chief Executive Officer of Utz, said, 'We expect these transactions to deliver on our supply chain transformation and value creation initiatives, to fast-track our deleveraging timeline by a full year, and to accelerate our brand portfolio strategy to better optimize for growth. With this important step in the optimization of our supply chain and brand portfolio, together with immediate benefits to free cash flow from lower interest expense, we are well-positioned to execute against our expansion plans across the U.S. and deliver on our margin target.'\\n\\nFriedman continued, 'Our Home's portfolio of Better-for-You brands is well aligned with Good Health\\u00ae and R.W. Garcia's\\u00ae missions of bringing healthy, innovative snacks to consumers. On behalf of everyone at Utz, I would like to thank our associates within the Good Health\\u00ae and R.W. Garcia\\u00ae businesses for their many contributions. They have a great place within Our Home, and I am confident they will have exciting opportunities ahead.'\\n\\nAaron Greenwald, Founder and CEO of Our Home, said, 'We are thrilled to announce this acquisition from Utz as it significantly scales Our Home's snacking platform and manufacturing footprint across the United States. These transactions support our vision to deliver snacks that satisfy while creating a sense of connection and comfort at tremendous value. Through our owned-production facilities led by our invaluable team members, along with a carefully curated brand portfolio, we aim to be the preferred choice for those seeking high-quality, Better-for-You snacks.'\\n\\nFinancial Benefits of the Transactions\\n\\nThe transactions are expected to provide approximately $150 million in after-tax net proceeds, which Utz will use to pay down its long-term debt. The debt reduction is expected to lower interest expense by approximately $12 million in fiscal 2024 based on the Company's current outlook for interest rates, and to accelerate the Company's plan for achieving its target of approximately 3.0x Net Leverage by a full year from the end of fiscal 2026 to the end of fiscal 2025.\\n\\nThe Company expects the impact of the transactions to be accretive to its Adjusted Earnings per Share on a full-year basis in 2024, reflecting the foregone profit related to the Good Health\\u00ae and R.W. Garcia\\u00ae brands, and after factoring in the benefit of cost savings and the use of net proceeds from the sale to paydown long-term debt and reduce interest expense. Utz estimates that Good Health\\u00ae and R.W. Garcia\\u00ae-related products contributed approximately $65 million in net sales for the fiscal-year ended December 31, 2023.\\n\\nIn addition, at the Company's recent 2023 Investor Day, Utz provided fiscal 2026 financial targets that included targeted Supply Chain Network Optimization cost savings of approximately $45 million to be achieved from 2024 through 2026. The Company expects that the completion of these transactions will accelerate the timing of cost savings. Management will further discuss this impact, in addition to its fiscal year 2024 outlook, on its fiscal-year 2023 earnings conference call on February 29, 2024.\\n\\nPreliminary, Unaudited Fiscal-Year 2023 Net Sales Results and Adjusted EBITDA Outlook\\n\\nIn the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, the Company's Circana total retail sales increased 4.1% and Power Brands increased 5.3%, both ahead of Salty Snack Category growth of 2.8%. The Company's total retail sales growth was led by volume growth of 4.3% compared to the Salty Snack Category volume decline of (1.9%)(1). Additionally, based on preliminary financial information, the Company estimates fourth quarter total net sales declined between (1.3%) to (0.2%) to between $350 million and $354 million. The Company anticipates that its net sales growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 to be more consistent with retail sales growth.\\n\\nFor the fiscal-year 2023, based on preliminary financial information, the Company estimates 2023 total net sales growth in a range of 2.0% to 2.2%, and is narrowing its fiscal-year 2023 Adjusted EBITDA outlook range to growth of 9.5% to 10.0% versus the prior expectation of growth of 8% to 11%.\\n\\nThese preliminary results are based on the Company's current estimate of its results for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2023 and remain subject to normal year-end accounting procedures and are subject to change. Under the federal securities laws, the Company is not permitted to release non-GAAP results until it is able to disclose the most directly comparable GAAP measure(2). Due to the Company's year-end closing process, such GAAP figures are not available in advance of the release of such information on February 29, 2024, when Utz plans to release its fiscal-year 2023 financial results. At that time, the Company will host a conference call and webcast with members of the executive management team to discuss these results at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time.\\n\\nPlease visit the 'Events & Presentations' section of Utz's Investor Relations website at https://investors.utzsnacks.com to access the live webcast and presentation.

We use non-GAAP financial measures to budget, make operating and strategic decisions, and evaluate our performance. These non-GAAP financial measures do not represent financial performance in accordance with generally accepted accounted principles in the United States ('GAAP') and may exclude items that are significant in understanding and assessing financial results. Therefore, these measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income, cash flows from operations or other measures of profitability, liquidity or performance under GAAP. You should be aware that the presentation of these measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies.\\n\\nManagement believes that non-GAAP financial measures should be considered as supplements to the GAAP reported measures, should not be considered replacements for, or superior to, the GAAP measures and may not be comparable to similarly named measures used by other companies. We believe that these non-GAAP measures of financial results provide useful information to investors regarding certain financial and business trends relating to the financial condition and results of operations of the Company to date and that the presentation of non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors in the evaluation of our operating performance compared to other companies in the salty snack industry, as similar measures are commonly used by the companies in this industry. These non-GAAP financial measures are subject to inherent limitations as they reflect the exercise of judgments by management about which expense and income are excluded or included in determining these non-GAAP financial measures. The non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance.\\n\\nUtz uses the following non-GAAP financial measures in its financial communications, and in the future could use others:\\n\\nAdjusted Net Income\\n\\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share\\n\\nEBITDA\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA as % of Net Sales (Adjusted EBITDA Margin)\\n\\nNormalized Adjusted EBITDA\\n\\nNet Leverage Ratio\\n\\nAdjusted Net Income is defined as Net Income excluding the additional Depreciation and Amortization expense, a non-cash item, related to the Business Combination with Collier Creek Holdings and the acquisitions of Kennedy Endeavors, Kitchen Cooked, Inventure, Golden Flake, Truco Enterprises, R.W. Garcia and Festida. In addition, Adjusted Net Income is also adjusted to exclude deferred financing fees, interest income, and expense relating to IO loans and certain non-cash items, such as those related to stock-based compensation, hedging, and purchase commitments adjustments, asset impairments, acquisition and integration costs, business transformation initiatives, remeasurement of warrant liabilities and financing-related costs. Lastly, Adjusted Net Income normalizes the income tax provision to account for the above-mentioned adjustments.\\n\\nAdjusted Earnings Per Share is defined as Adjusted Net Income (as defined, herein) divided by the weighted average shares outstanding for each period on a fully diluted basis, assuming the Private Placement Warrants are net settled and the Shares of Class V Common Stock held by Continuing Members is converted to Class A Common Stock.\\n\\nEBITDA is defined as Net Income before Interest, Income Taxes, and Depreciation and Amortization.\\n\\nAdjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA further adjusted to exclude certain non-cash items, such as stock-based compensation, hedging and purchase commitments adjustments, and asset impairments; acquisition and integration costs; business transformation initiatives; and financing-related costs. Adjusted EBITDA is one of the key performance indicators we use in evaluating our operating performance and in making financial, operating, and planning decisions. We believe Adjusted EBITDA is useful to the users of this release and financial information contained in the release in the evaluation of Utz's operating performance compared to other companies in the salty snack industry, as similar measures are commonly used by companies in this industry. We have historically reported an Adjusted EBITDA metric to investors and banks for covenant compliance. We also provide in this release, Adjusted EBITDA as a percentage of Net Sales, as an additional measure for readers to evaluate our Adjusted EBITDA margins on Net Sales.\\n\\nNormalized Adjusted EBITDA is defined as Adjusted EBITDA after giving effect to pre-transaction Adjusted EBITDA for certain acquisitions and dispositions from time to time.\\n\\nNet Leverage Ratio is defined as Normalized Adjusted EBITDA divided by Net Debt. Net Debt is defined as Gross Debt less Cash and Cash Equivalents.\\n\\nManagement believes that the non-GAAP financial measures are meaningful to investors because they increase transparency and assist investors to understand and analyze our ongoing operational performance. The financial measures are shown as supplemental disclosures in this release because they are widely used by the investment community for analysis and comparative evaluation. They also provide additional metrics to evaluate the Company's operations and, when considered with both the GAAP results and the reconciliation to the most comparable GAAP measures, provide a more complete understanding of the Company's business than could be obtained absent this disclosure. The non-GAAP measures are not and should not be considered an alternative to the most comparable GAAP measures or any other figure calculated in accordance with GAAP, or as an indicator of operating performance. The Company's calculation of the non-GAAP financial measures may differ from methods used by other companies. Management believes that the non-GAAP measures are important to have an understanding of the Company's overall operating results in the periods presented. The non-GAAP financial measures are not recognized in accordance with GAAP and should not be viewed as an alternative to GAAP measures of performance. As new events or circumstances arise, these definitions could change. When the definitions change, we will provide the updated definitions and present the related non-GAAP historical results on a comparable basis.\\n\\nForward-Looking Statements\\n\\nThis press release includes 'forward-looking statements' within the meaning of the 'safe harbor' provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"NASA\\n\\nABSTRACT breaks down mind-bending scientific research, future tech, new discoveries, and major breakthroughs.\\n\\n\\n\\nMoon dust has fascinated scientists ever since Neil Armstrong scooped up a vial of the stuff back in 1969. The jagged and statically charged lunar dust provides clues about the moon's early formation, and tells us about our own geologic history and that of the inner solar system.\\n\\nNow, planetary scientists have discovered strange \\\"anomalies\\\" in sun-reflecting particles covering meter-wide moon rocks. This research, published in the Journal of Geophysical Research \\u2013 Planets, could help scientists understand more about the processes that formed and changed the moon's crust and created unexplained magnetic anomalies. But, for now at least, the odd rocks and dust particles remain an unsolved mystery.\\n\\nResearchers came across these extraterrestrial dust bunnies while trawling a catalog of images taken by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft. They used artificial intelligence to go through the more than a million images and narrow rocks of interest down to around 130,000.\\n\\n'We keep finding unknown objects in this way, such as the anomalous rocks that we are investigating in this new study,\\\" said study co-author Valentin Bickel, from the University of Bern, in a press statement.\\n\\nThey saw that some rocks around the Reiner K crater\\u2014a smaller impact crater near the larger Reiner crater on the western side of the moon\\u2014had noticeable dark patches on them. 'Normally, lunar dust is very porous and reflects a lot of light back in the direction of illumination,' explained Marcel Hess, an image analyst from the Technische Universit\\u00e4t Dortmund. 'However, when the dust is compacted, the overall brightness usually increases. This is not the case with the observed dust-covered rocks.'\\n\\nThe team described the rocks' strange light-reflecting properties using a technique called photometric analysis, which measures how light reflects off objects.\\n\\nThe researchers suspect that the dust-covered boulders were dispersed as a result of the impact that formed the crater. But not all of the boulders around the Reiner K crater were covered in the perplexing dust.\\n\\nJust what this dust is and why it only settled on some rocks and not others is still a mystery. The study's authors theorize it could have to do with the physical features of the moon's landscape, something about the microscopic structure of the rocks themselves, the static properties of the dust, or the moon's magnetic fields. The Reiner Gamma region, where the craters lie, is a known magnetic hotspot.\\n\\nThe researchers hope that an upcoming NASA mission to the moon, Lunar Vertex, which will collect samples from the region, will shed some light on the dusty enigma. The mission will also map Reiner Gamma's magnetic field to help uncover how parts of the moon got their distinctive swirls and bumps. That will help planetary scientists understand not only how the moon formed, but also other astronomical objects with thin or no atmosphere in our solar system.\\n\\n'Current knowledge of the moon's magnetic properties is very limited. These new rocks will shed light on the history of the Moon and its magnetic core,' said planetary geologist Ottaviano R\\u00fcschso, from the Universit\\u00e4t M\\u00fcnster, in a statement.\\n\\nPlus, understanding how dust swooshes around the moon will be vital for planning future human settlements on the moon, since moon dust is notorious for causing problems for habitats, equipment, and human lungs and brain cells.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"The 'Killers of the Flower Moon' star on how to curse in Blackfoot, being nominated for an Oscar, and the many Native actors she hopes will follow her.\\nFebruary 4, 2024\\nPhotograph by Carlos Jaramillo\\nLife was different for Lily Gladstone in the summer of 2020. She had built up a small but impressive r\\u00e9sum\\u00e9 in independent films, including two by \\nKelly Reichardt\\n, 'Certain Women' and 'First Cow.' But the pandemic had shut down the industry, and she was worried about sustaining an acting career. Gladstone, who calls herself a 'bee nerd,' looked into applying for a seasonal job with the Department of Agriculture, tracking murder hornets. Then she got an invitation to meet \\nMartin Scorsese\\n over Zoom. He was making a film based on David Grann's book '\\nKillers of the Flower Moon\\n,' about a series of mysterious deaths in Oklahoma in the nineteen-twenties, when the Osage Nation was flush with oil money. Her performance in the film didn't just boost her career\\u2014it has now earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, the first for a Native American woman.\\nThe role of Mollie Kyle, who lived from 1886 to 1937, is a tricky one. She married Ernest Burkhart (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), a white man who conspired with his uncle William Hale (Robert De Niro) to knock off Mollie's relatives in order to inherit her family's headrights. In the film, Mollie suspects from the start that Ernest is after her money\\u2014'Coyote wants money,' she teases him\\u2014but she doesn't divorce him until after his crimes are exposed in court. Playing her scenes with DiCaprio, one of the brightest stars in Hollywood, Gladstone adopts a Mona Lisa smile; ambiguity is central to her mesmerizing performance, and much of it comes across without words. And yet she resists the trope of the stoic, suffering Native heroine. She's by turns flirtatious, shrewd, agonized, ailing, and clear-eyed. Anthony Lane, in his \\nNew Yorker\\n \\nreview\\n, called her 'unmistakably the most compelling presence in the movie.'\\nGladstone, who is thirty-seven, was raised on the Blackfeet Reservation, in Montana, the daughter of a white mother and a father of Blackfeet and Nez Perce ancestry. No acting career is a sure bet, but Hollywood's treatment of Native characters and performers has historically been worse than neglectful\\u2014it's been vilifying and insulting. The Oscars, in their nine-and-a-half-decade history, haven't done much better. In 1973, \\nSacheen Littlefeather\\n was booed when she took the stage to criticize the industry's representation of Native Americans, at the behest of Marlon Brando. A handful of Indigenous nominees have shown up in the acting categories\\u2014most recently, the Native Mexican actress \\nYalitza Aparicio\\n ('Roma')\\u2014but Gladstone walks a mostly untrodden path, and she does it with composure and conviction. When we spoke recently, she was in Washington, D.C., for a screening of 'Killers' at the National Museum of the American Indian, along with the Osage musician Scott George, who is nominated for his original song 'Wahzhazhe (A Song for My People).' 'There are a couple historic nominations this year, and I'm so happy that there's an Osage making history, too,' she said. We spoke about her own historic nomination, her passion for language revitalization, and how to curse in Blackfoot. Our conversation has been edited and condensed.\\nYou're in the heat of Oscar season. What's life like right now?\\nIt's a lot of nice hotels and a very rapid-paced schedule. It's really lovely, the reach that this film is having. It's been a lot of travel, a lot of meeting new people.\\nAwards season is this huge machine. As someone who's been catapulted into it, have you had moments that have felt particularly surreal or fun or stressful?\\nIt does get to a point where you get a little overwhelmed by all of the celebrity, and then pretty soon it's just people, you know? Probably the most surreal moment was when I was at the National Board of Review awards. Patti Smith made the introduction for my award, and I was sitting between her and Daniel Day-Lewis. And then the next day I was at the A.F.I. luncheon, in L.A., sitting between Tim Cook and Leo DiCaprio, and I was telling Tim, 'Why is it that today feels a little bit \\nmore\\n grounded and familiar than yesterday?' When Tim Cook and Leo DiCaprio become 'Oh, hey, guys!'\\u2014it's a strange place to be.\\nThe people you've collaborated with on this movie are, of course, old hands at this kind of thing. Leo, Marty, Bob\\u2014not that I have any reason to call them by those names. Have they given you any sort of advice on what to expect?\\nWhat I really appreciate is: there's not this protective, patriarchal 'Let me give you advice, kid' sort of thing. Anytime Leo's done it, it's been completely self-aware and joking. He's kind of a goofball and a wise-ass. They lead by example. That's been the most grounding thing, because I've been able to be in proximity to people who are so used to it. And meeting other people I'm just so excited by\\u2014how quickly America Ferrera took to me. I'm a huge fan of Emma Stone, and she's been lovely, and all of these people that are now in a peer group, I guess. You just get the sense that it's not as big or scary as you need to make it. It's just about human connection in the end.\\nAt the same time that you're dressing up and going to award shows, you're also carrying the banner of a historic nomination. The Oscars have had an extremely spotty record with honoring Indigenous people, and you're the first Native American woman in the Best Actress category. How has that been sitting with you?\\nI keep saying it's overdue. We're in the ninety-sixth year of the Academy Awards, and we're on Native American land. Natives are natural storytellers. A big part of our understanding of ourselves, since time immemorial, is our stories. So it's just odd that, in the United States, it's taken almost a hundred years for a Native American to reach this milestone in a major acting category. We've had Indigenous representation. We've had Yalitza Aparicio, Graham Greene ['Dances with Wolves'] in supporting, Chief Dan George ['Little Big Man'] in supporting. We've had global Indigenous recognition. But, like you said, it's sprinkled.\\nI'm friends with Sterlin Harjo, the co-creator of 'Reservation Dogs.' We're both in the circuit right now, and we happened to find ourselves in the same hotel the week before last. He put it really well. He said, 'We're in a position where we're kicking the door in. When you kick the door in, you should just put your foot in the door and stand there.' Kicking the door in and running through it means it's going to shut behind you. While I'm the first specifically Native American Indigenous woman, I stand on the shoulders of a lot of performers. It's all circumstantial that I have this moniker of the first, and I'm certainly not going to be the last. If I've kicked the door in, I'm just trying to stand here and leave it open for everybody else.\\nAs a student of Oscar history, I know that it's been a mixed experience for people who have been the firsts in their categories. \\nSidney Poitier\\n was the first Black man to win Best Actor, in 1964, and when he was being honored at the mayor's office, in New York City, reporters kept asking him about civil rights. He finally snapped\\u2014he was not a person who generally snapped\\u2014and said, 'Why is it everything you guys ask refers to the Negroness of my life and not my acting?' I'm curious if you've felt that tension of being out here as an actor, but also as the face of a community. And, in addition to that, you're playing an Osage woman, so it's not even quite your community.\\nThat's something that I try to highlight first. There's just the roadblock that a lot of Natives have in representation, that people don't even think we're still here. There's some empirical data out there, some surveys\\u2014in one study I was reading, forty per cent of people didn't think that Native Americans still existed. The perception of who we are, which has largely been shaped by Hollywood\\u2014it's very narrow. There's an assumption that we just disappeared.\\nThere's an incredible diversity in Indian country. I'm not Osage, but as a Native actor I've played a lot of roles now that required that I speak another Indigenous language. And I'm by no means even fluent in Blackfoot! I can introduce myself. I have a few words and phrases. I know some of the bad words.\\nCan you please curse in Blackfoot right now?\\nI'm just gonna drop this for my Blackfeet folks, but I'm not going to say what it means. \\nSiksimiisii\\n was one of the worst and funniest things you could say about somebody. It's a fairly PG thing, but it's my favorite word in our language. Good luck trying to phonetically transcribe it!\\nAnother film that I did last year was 'Fancy Dance,' which premi\\u00e8red at Sundance. Isabel Deroy-Olson, the actress who plays my niece, and I were playing Seneca-Cayuga, and our director and co-writer, Erica Tremblay, is Seneca-Cayuga. Erica was going through a three-year-long language-revitalization program and wanted to make a film where she saw modern characters speaking Cayuga. So, when Isabel and I were at this talkback, a woman very sweetly asked if it felt good for us to be able to speak in our native language. And Isabel and I looked at each other. Neither of us is Seneca-Cayuga! It was really difficult for us to pick up the language, and to get to the point where we could act in it as well. Tribal languages are incredibly different from each other. The perception that we all speak one Native American language is very commonly held. Most of us are not fluent even in our own languages.\\nThat's an aspect of Native performance that I think a lot of people take for granted. We celebrate other actors for picking up European languages for a role and sounding proficient, but for some reason that same awe and credit are often dismissed for Native actors, because people assume, 'Oh, you all speak that.'\\nIn your \\nGolden Globes speech\\n, you talked about how your mother had advocated for your school to teach Blackfoot when you were growing up. Can you tell me a little bit about that?\\nIt was in second grade, when [the educator] Edward North Peigan came into our classroom. I didn't really know what my mom was up to. I just knew that she was doing everything she could to help in community-building, and she had a degree in early-childhood education. She remembers having to find the funding to pay for a language teacher to come in. The school was fairly mixed\\u2014majority Blackfeet students, but a lot of non-Blackfeet students\\u2014so there was a little bit of pushback. And my mom was saying, 'Well, we're on Blackfeet land, and most of your students are Blackfeet, and it's important for brain development, it's important for sense of self, it's important for connection to community.' I'm so grateful to her. My dad would come into the classroom and record when Edward was speaking so that we would have an archive of some of our language. But I just remember sitting there and learning how to count, learning how to introduce ourselves.\\nAs you were growing up on the Blackfeet Reservation, what sort of art or culture called out to you?\\nI've said it a lot now: 'Return of the Jedi' and my love of Ewoks gave me the early spark to want to be an actor. Missoula Children's Theatre is a touring company, and they take plays to schools all across the country, especially in smaller rural areas. They're in residence for a week and do a big play for the community. So I loved that. But I also remember when Edward and his wife, Wilma, were coming to school and teaching language. Every year, you put on your little school play, and I think a lot of people were pushing for a Nativity play. And the pushback was, 'Well, while we have this grant to have Edward and Wilma in our schools, maybe we ought to do a different story.'\\nSo we staged a trickster story\\u2014our trickster figure. He's also a creator of our world. A lot of these stories, they're fun for kids, but they're also teaching you these sacred world-building lessons. There was an element of the story where the trickster is being chased by this giant rock rolling down a hill, and all of these nighthawks come in to try to save him, and they break apart this big, rolling boulder by throwing their feces. So I remember being one of these little nighthawks, just pummelling one of my classmates dressed as a rock with these little balled-up pieces of paper, and how fun that was for all the kids\\u2014and how triggering it was for a lot of the more conservative families, the non-Blackfeet folks! Our stories don't move the same way Western stories do. They don't have the same lessons. That was a really foundational experience in early childhood, as far as performance goes.\\nYour \\nhigh-school yearbook\\n has made the rounds online, so I know that you were voted Most Likely to Win an Oscar.\\nIt's really sweet. My graduating class, and a lot of people that were in the same drama program\\u2014they're reuniting to watch the Oscars in our old high-school theatre. And then Josh Ryder, who's the other [classmate] that was voted Most Likely to Win an Oscar\\u2014he's still a brilliant actor. He's a restaurateur now. Anybody in Seattle, go check out Betty Restaurant & Bar, on Queen Anne. It's the best.\\nShoutout!\\nLittle shoutout to Betty. I was really more involved in my sophomore and junior years. My senior year\\u2014this is silly\\u2014I wanted to do more complex work than high school would allow for. So I jumped over to the community college, where my mom was teaching. But, growing up back home, after Missoula Children's Theatre shows, people would tell my parents that when they saw me, like, in full costume playing one of Cinderella's ugly stepsisters, they didn't recognize me. I disappeared into character. My identity at home and then in high school became synonymous with acting.\\nThen you studied acting and directing at the University of Montana. When you got out, what was your early career like? What kind of roles were you auditioning for, what were you getting, and what kind of day jobs were you doing for survival?\\nMy dad gave me a little piece of knowledge that, until recently, I thought was a Blackfeet saying: 'Prey runs to the hunter.' Turns out it comes from Carl Sagan! [\\nIn '\\nIntelligent Life in the Universe\\n,' Sagan credits the line to the Soviet astronomer Iosif Samuilovich Shklovskii.\\n] Which is really cool, too. But my career has kind of been shaped that way. I graduated already cast into a touring theatre production with Montana Repertory Theatre, which is a company attached to the University of Montana actor-training program. So I went out for a year with 'To Kill a Mockingbird' and played Mrs. Dubose, the ninety-year-old morphine addict.\\nOh, nice!\\nThen I had a costume transition in the intermission and played a lady in the court. I also doubled as crew, so it gave me a holistic sense of what it is to bring a production together. After that, I decided to stay in Montana instead of going to L.A. or New York. My scene work in class was always praised, but I also got a little bit disillusioned with the whole casting process. If I had gone to L.A. or New York and done the classic [route]\\u2014audition endlessly, get an agent\\u2014just thinking about it was starting to kill my passion for it. So I stayed in Montana, where I had built some connections with local filmmakers. In between the theatre tours, I auditioned for a one-woman show that toured schools.\\nOh, I read about this. And you were acting against a prerecorded track in school auditoriums?\\nYeah. It's a Seattle-based company called \\nLiving Voices\\n, and I was performing a show that was teaching about the Native American boarding-school experience, with historical documents projected behind you on the screen and prerecorded voices from other actors that etch out this period in history. You act as a person who's living through it for about twenty minutes\\u2014\",\n",

The AI turned up 130,000 images of rocks with compelling features, half of which the researchers reviewed. Their research is \\npublished\\n in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets.\\nOn the Moon\\u2014a rocky satellite devoid of winds and erosion\\u2014dust is not just a powdery irritant. The crushed rock is still minuscule, like the stuff that causes our Earthly sneezes, but Moon dust is sharp and electrostatically charged. Poring over the images of boulders on the Moon, the researchers hoped to find a superlative rock that revealed newfound properties.\\n'We recognized a boulder with distinctive dark areas on just one image,' said Ottaviano R\\u00fcsch, a researcher at Westf\\u00e4lische Wilhelm Universit\\u00e4t M\\u00fcnster, and the study's lead author, in a university \\nrelease\\n. 'This rock was very different from all the others, as it scatters less light back towards the sun than other rocks. We suspect that this is due to the particular dust structure, such as the density and grain size of the dust.'\\nThe team concluded that the boulders were ejected when the crater Reiner K formed. Aside from their photometric properties\\u2014which is to say, how the dusty boulders looked compared to other Moon rocks\\u2014'these dust-covered boulders show no further difference with respect to other boulder,' the group wrote in the study.\\n'Normally, lunar dust is very porous and reflects a lot of light back in the direction of illumination,' said Marcel Hess, a researcher at TU Dortmund University and co-author of the study, in the release. 'However, when the dust is compacted, the overall brightness usually increases. This is not the case with the observed dust-covered rocks.'\\nSo what the heck is going on with this dust? The team isn't quite sure, but the \\nLunar Vertex\\n mission may have answers. The solar-powered lander is slated to explore over 1.2 miles of the Reiner Gamma region, where it will sample some of the magnetic properties on the lunar surface. If the lander focuses on the photometric behavior of the dust, the team wrote, it may clarify why the dust appears different to other lunar dust, in turn potentially revealing details of the Moon's formation or impact history.\\nMore: \\nFate of Japan's History-Making \\u2018Lunar Sniper' in Doubt After Power Malfunction\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"(The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news, analysis and commentary from academic experts.)\\n\\n(THE CONVERSATION) Boulder, Colorado, passed stricter regulations against plastic bags at the beginning of 2024, banning them from all retail stores. The tougher rule builds on a 2013 local law that banned plastic bags from grocery stores and began charging shoppers 10 cents for every paper bag they required at checkout. The new law, part of the state's Plastic Pollution Reduction Act, also prohibits restaurants and retail food establishments from using Styrofoam takeout containers.\\n\\nThe Conversation interviewed Eleanor Putnam-Farr, an assistant professor of marketing at Rice University and co-author of ' Forgot Your Bottle or Bag Again? How Well-Placed Reminder Cues Can Help Consumers Build Sustainable Habits,' about the challenges of changing people's behavior \\u2013 even when their intentions are good.\\n\\nHow popular are plastic bag bans and taxes?\\n\\nLaws like Boulder's are popular. Twelve states, plus Puerto Rico, and more than 300 municipalities, including Philadelphia, have banned plastic bag use by consumers. Charging a fee for bags is less common, but rules like this are in effect in Washington, D.C.; Honolulu, Hawaii; Santa Fe, New Mexico; and other U.S. cities.\\n\\nAnd these types of regulations aren't limited to the U.S. Many other countries are also cracking down on plastic bag use, including China, Namibia and Portugal.\\n\\nCities and towns have tried a lot of strategies, from educating consumers to banning the use of bags or just nudging them to do the right thing by imposing small fees. Nudges leave the choice up to the consumer and are often more palatable than outright bans.\\n\\nMany cities have reported decreases in plastic bag use after imposing plastic bag bans and fees, but the effects may be small.\\n\\nIn a study on the efficacy of a bag fee implemented in Toronto, researchers found a 3.4% increase in the use of reusable bags, mostly among higher-income customers.\\n\\nMaybe. Research on parents who were assessed fees when they picked up their children late at 10 different day care centers found that small charges actually led to a big increase in tardy parents \\u2013 who apparently felt they were paying for the right to be late.\\n\\nBoulder may be fighting the same sort of complacency. Disposable bag fees collected from 2013 through 2022 fluctuated slightly year to year, but increased more often than not \\u2013 suggesting that people are buying more bags, not fewer. Earning 6 cents for every bag sold \\u2013 the stores keep the rest \\u2013 Boulder brought in US$243,507 in tax revenue in 2021 and $248,518 in 2022.\\n\\nWhy don't more consumers use reusable bags?\\n\\nConsumers stick to plastic bags for many reasons, including convenience. Research on farmers market shoppers in Ohio suggests accidentally leaving reusable bags in their cars or at home is an obstacle, and some consumers prefer plastic bags because they reuse them for trash and pet waste. But researchers from Chile, which enacted a complete ban on plastic bags in 2019, found that people there at first weren't committed to reusable bags. Consumers in Chile felt pressured to change their behavior, and guilty when they didn't comply. They also felt like 100% of the burden of sustainability was forced on them, all of which undermined the goal of the ban.\\n\\nWhat does work to encourage consumers to use reusable bags?\\n\\nThe most important thing is to understand that most people don't set out to use more plastic. So the best solutions help consumers achieve their goals and make access to reusable bags easier. The key is to determine the biggest impediment to shoppers bringing reusable bags.\\n\\nIn our research about reusable bottles, my colleagues at the Yale Center for Customer Insights and at Google knew that most employees of the office site had reusable bottles but forgot to bring them to the water stations to refill them. Instead of banning plastic cups or disposable bottles, we created reminders and placed them near the workers' desks. These reminders helped people behave the way they wanted to behave and had the added benefit of making the people feel good about the overall process, which can be its own reward.\\n\\nThe same can work for reusable bags even without imposing bans or fines. If people don't have reusable bags, make them available. If people are forgetting their bags in the cars, create reminders in the parking lot. If people are leaving their bags at home, supply bag hooks they can place near their doors. These create easy visual reminders to grab the shopping bags on their way out of the house.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"The nearly 7,000-square-foot home known as Tirranna and designed by Frank Lloyd Wright has landed a buyer.\\n\\nClosing earlier this week for $6 million, the house in New Canaan, CT, was listed last May with an $8 million asking price. The seven-bedroom, 8.5-bath home was built in 1956 and sits on 14 bucolic acres.\\n\\nAnd that pedigree is what attracted the buyers.\\n\\n'The buyers are fans of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture,' Safdie says. 'You could tell that from how well informed they were about the property on their first visit. They researched the history and gathered information from archived documents. They knew everything about it\\u2014they pointed out some of the original room setups and referred to original floor plans.'\\n\\nWright's signature Usonian-style homes are mostly ranch-level and crafted from Philippine mahogany, as this one is. These houses also follow nearly the same layout, with a bedroom wing, wall of windows, and a fireplace in the open-concept living and dining areas, plus heated flooring and built-ins throughout.\\n\\nIncluded with this property is a guest studio, large barn, tennis court, and pool. Other unique features include a rooftop observatory and a wine cellar born out of a bomb shelter.\\n\\n'They loved the trails around the house and mentioned they would like to expand a trail on the back of the property, which extends uphill to a giant boulder,\\\" says Safdie of the buyers' plans for the lot.\\n\\nLandscape architect Frank Okamura designed the grounds, which include a waterfall. The Japanese gardens at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is among the late Okamura's projects.\\n\\n'We had great interest in the house and several offers,' Safdie says, noting that some were eying the place as a primary residence and others were considering it as a country home. 'Buyers came from varied locations but primarily from the New York-metropolitan area. The current owners elected Tirranna to be their primary residence.'\\n\\nThe sale is significant for a few reasons. First, it's among the higher-priced Wright properties to be sold in the last few years. While the Ennis House in Los Angeles sold for $18 million in 2019, most Wright-designed homes sell for far less.\\n\\nAlso, this ranks as one of the most expensive properties sold in New Canaan in the last year, according to Coldwell Banker Global Luxury, with which Safdie and Marsha Charles co-listed the property. Chau Ngo, of the Jennifer Leahy Team at Douglas Elliman, secured the buyer in the deal.\\n\\nWright was at a high point in his career when he designed this project, simultaneously working on the Guggenheim Museum in New York City and even living in this house during that period. In fact, some of the famed museum's scalloped glass windows were used to build this property's greenhouse.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"For a small city, Berkeley, California has a remarkably large presence in American culture. That's in part because of its role as the site of the early Free Speech Movement and related anti-Vietnam War protests, the Asian American movement, the country's first dog park and so many more firsts and cultural touchstones. In many ways Berkeley has become a paragon of liberal American culture, an early adopter of policies such as soda taxes and plastic bag bans that then catch on in the rest of the world.\\n\\nThese days, Berkeley is perhaps best known for being the home of the renowned University of California campus, founded here in 1868. But while the university has loomed large in many of the cultural moments that have made the city famous, there's so much more to Berkeley than just Cal: an abundance to do, see, eat and explore. Here's a list of our favorite things to do in Berkeley, CA.\\n\\nWander around campus\\n\\nYes, Berkeley is more than its campus, but the university is still a great place to start \\u2014 there's plenty to see here, even if you don't have a student ID. From main thoroughfare Oxford Street, walk through the eucalyptus grove on the Grinnell Pathway, stopping to take a few deep breaths and appreciating the peace that emanates from these towering giants.\\n\\nFrom there, you can poke into the picturesque Doe Library, picnic on one of the campus' many green lawns, or stroll around the classically beautiful Faculty Glade. Be sure to finish off your visit with a ride up 307-foot Sather Tower, also known as the Campanile, UC Berkeley's most famous symbol and a great place to enjoy views across the Bay and into Oakland. Keep an ear out for the tower's famous carillon program, which delights visitors and students with music that can be heard across campus three times a day.\\n\\nFind it: Sather Tower is located in the heart of UC Berkeley campus, between Doe Library and Faculty Glade. It is open Monday-Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m., Saturday from 1-5 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3-5 p.m. (closed for the 2 p.m. carillon concert.)\\n\\nLearn about local history\\n\\nBefore you leave campus, make a stop at the Free Speech Movement Cafe, where you can learn about the history of the movement and grab a latte or a sandwich.\\n\\nFor important insight into local Indigenous history, check to see if Ohlone restaurant \\u2018o\\u1e6d\\u1e6doy is open at the Hearst Anthropology Museum, or go see co-owners Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino at one of their regular speaking engagements around Berkeley and the Bay. (At the time of writing, \\u2018o\\u1e6d\\u1e6doy planned to re-open in spring 2024, staying open each spring, fall and summer and closing in the rainy season.) Medina and Trevino have used their two restaurants, Cafe Ohlone and \\u2018o\\u1e6d\\u1e6doy, to bring the foodways of the Ohlone community to the mainstream, served with a mix of modern elegance and down-home deliciousness and often accompanied by a cultural or language lesson. If you can't try the food, see if your schedule matches up with Medina and Trevino's monthly talk at the Berkeley Public Library.\\n\\nTo soak in some off-campus history, sign up for a South Asian Radical History Walking Tour, which explores the lesser-known history of the area's Indian, Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrant communities. When the world descended on California in the 1850s for the gold rush, South Asians came too. Historians Anirvan Chatterjee and Barnali Ghosh take visitors through 120 years and two miles of history, with a particular focus on exploring how these communities have supported the activist causes of their new home.\\n\\nTop it all off with a guaranteed-to-be-adorable stop by the world's first dog park at Ohlone Park. The work of the same activists who created People's Park, which the university has now closed for construction, Ohlone Park was created to be an off-leash space where dogs are free be dogs. See if you can find the memorial fire hydrant inscribed to Doris Richards, a beloved dog park leader.\\n\\nGo shopping\\n\\nLots may have changed in Berkeley since the heady 1960s and 70s, but the town's famous Telegraph Avenue has retained at least a glimmer of its counterculture vibe. For maximum blast-from-the-past feel, while away the hours in a maze of stacks at Moe's Books, sift through vinyl at OG music store Amoeba, or see if any of the older hippies at the Telegraph Avenue Chess Club are at their Telegraph Avenue-and-Haste Street meeting spot. If you're hungry, the street continues to serve students with a remarkable variety of cuisines, from banh mi to Burmese, burgers to bubble tea \\u2014 plus delicious custom ice cream sandwiches.\\n\\nIf 'gritty hippie' isn't really your vibe, head over to more upscale and family-oriented Solano Avenue (technically just over the border in Albany), or the sleek boutiques along Fourth Street. Or, for a quintessential Berkeley experience, stop in at Berkeley Bowl. The grocery store is a beloved institution whose riot of colorful, diverse and affordable produce makes for a unique and entertaining way to plan a meal or grab a snack.\\n\\nHit up a museum\\n\\nA town that loves learning as much as Berkeley does must have great museums \\u2014 and the ones here don't disappoint. Follow your nose to the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents, where more than 200 natural essences from fruits, flowers, trees, grasses and resins are on display, along with artifacts and books about the history of perfumery. Then head up the hill to Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley, which has interactive exhibits on seismic forces, DNA and the flight dynamics of paper airplanes.\\n\\nFor a slightly different take on science, spend an afternoon at the Berkeley Natural History Museums, which features exhibits on entomology, zoology and paleontology. Or if you're less of a science nerd and more of a film buff, check out the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive (known as BAMPFA), which folds stunning modern art into exhibits about movie history and offers a film series showing movies from masters like Werner Herzog as well as from modern filmmakers from across the globe.\\n\\nBask in the great outdoors\\n\\nLike much of the Bay Area, Berkeley is set against a backdrop of stunning hills \\u2014 vivid green in springtime, burnished gold in summer and fall. Both locals and visitors have access to a huge variety of beautiful public spaces to enjoy the great outdoors.\\n\\nIf you love flowers and plants, the Berkeley Rose Garden and UC Berkeley Botanical Garden are full of fascinating and gorgeous specimens. The Rose Garden is most beautiful in May, when blooms are at their height; check out the carnivorous plants at the Botanical Garden's Tropical House or the gorgeous redwood grove any time of year. To see a huge diversity of flora out in the wild, head to Tilden Regional Park, where the Seaview Trail, the child-sized steam train and a 1911 carousel are especially beloved.\\n\\nElsewhere in the hills, Berkeley's many rock parks offer a distinctive slice of the East Bay outdoors. The area's unique geology provides lots of opportunities for scrambling \\u2014 or bouldering and rock climbing, if you're more experienced. Head to Cragmont Rock Park for a good beginner climbing spot and Indian Rock Park for unmatched sunset views \\u2014 no climbing skills required.\\n\\nVisit C\\u00e9sar Ch\\u00e1vez Park at the Berkeley Marina to appreciate San Francisco Bay up close. Fly a kite, listen to the waves splash along the sea wall, rent kayaks, grab a drink or dinner at beloved institution Skates on the Bay, or get a visitors' pass and play captain at Cal Sailing Club.\\n\\nEnjoy the show\\n\\nAfter sunset, immerse yourself in all that Berkeley-by-night has to offer. On campus, Zellerbach Hall hosts world-class lectures, theater and music, from classical to modern. Off campus, if you're in the mood for theater, try Shotgun Players, which often features new work from up-and-coming playwrights, or look up what's playing at local theater the Berkeley Rep. Down the hill, the UC Theater hosts a slate of diverse, international musicians, from as far away as Mali and as close as the Bay Area, while Cornerstone caters to the student crowd with a mix of hipster rock, Americana and R & B.\\n\\nThe Starry Plough, which has been around for half a century, still enthusiastically hosts poetry slams and Irish sessions. Equally longstanding next-door neighbor La Pe\\u00f1a Cultural Center offers salsa, rumba, bachata, singing and dancing classes and parties, supporting a rich community of Latinx musicians from around California and beyond. Grand dame Freight & Salvage has been hosting traditional music \\u2014 which started as folk, roots and bluegrass and has come to encompass genres from across the globe \\u2014 since 1968. Devoted event organizer Harold Adler brings it home at the still-underground Art House, whose collection of psychedelic dayglo prints, 1960s and '70s concert posters and vintage vinyl mix perfectly with an eclectic lineup of musicians playing Grateful Dead-inspired jams and underground punk. It's a vibe that's perfectly Berkeley \\u2014 both then and now.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Whether the toilet lid is up or down doesn't make much difference in the spread of airborne bacterial and viral particles.\\n \\n\\n\\nFile this one under \\\"Studies We Wish Had Let Us Remain Ignorant.\\\" Scientists at the University of Arizona decided to investigate whether closing the toilet lid before flushing reduces cross-contamination of bathroom surfaces by airborne bacterial and viral particles via \\\"\\ntoilet plumes\\n.\\\" The bad news is that putting a lid on it doesn't result in any substantial reduction in contamination, according to their \\nrecent paper\\n published in the American Journal of Infection Control. The good news: Adding a disinfectant to the toilet bowl before flushing and using disinfectant dispensers in the tank significantly reduce cross-contamination.\\n\\n\\nRegarding toilet plumes, we're not just talking about large water droplets that splatter when a toilet is flushed. Even smaller droplets can form and be spread into the surrounding air, potentially carrying bacteria like \\nE. coli\\n or a virus (e.g., norovirus) if an infected person has previously used said toilet. Pathogens can linger in the bowl even after repeated flushes, just waiting for their chance to launch into the air and spread disease. That's because larger droplets, in particular, can settle on surfaces before they dry, while smaller ones travel further on natural air currents.\\n\\n\\nThe first experiments examining whether toilet plumes contained contaminated particles were done in the 1950s, and the notion that disease could be spread this way was popularized in \\na 1975 study\\n. In 2022, physicists and engineers at the University of Colorado, Boulder, managed \\nto visualize\\n toilet plumes of tiny airborne particles ejected from toilets during a flush using a combination of green lasers and cameras. It made for some pretty vivid video footage:\\n\\n\\n\\\"If it's something you can't see, it's easy to represent it doesn't exist,\\\" study co-author John Grimaldi \\nsaid at the time\\n. They found that the ejected airborne particles could travel up to 6.6 feet per second, reaching heights of 4.9 feet above the toilet within 8 seconds. And if those particles were smaller (less than 5 microns), they could hang around in that air for over a minute.\\n\\n\\nMore relevant to this latest paper, it's \\nbeen suggested\\n that closing the lid before flushing could substantially reduce the airborne spread of contaminants. For example, \\nin 2019\\n, researchers at University College Cork deployed bioaerosol sensors in a shared lavatory for a week to monitor the number and size of contaminant particles. They concluded that flushing with the toilet lid down reduced airborne droplets between 30 and 60 percent. But this scenario also increased the diameter of the droplets and bacteria concentration. Leaving the lid down also means the airborne microdroplets are still detectable 16 minutes after flushing, 11 minutes longer than if one flushed with the lid up.\",\n",

Have a question for Care and Feeding? \\nSubmit it here\\n or post it in the \\nSlate Parenting Facebook group\\n.\\n \\nDear Care and Feeding,\\n \\nThe last time my husband and I visited his parents, we had a big conflict. My son was 18 months old, and without explaining where we were going\\u2014he told us we were going on 'a nice short trip'\\u2014he took us all on a very dangerous boulder-hopping trip in their not-so recreational vehicle. My son cried the whole time as we dodged branches and tried to stay upright as the tiny vehicle swayed left to right. I was furious. I confronted him afterwards, and he brushed it off as no big deal. That night he made some very passive aggressive comments to my son about our reaction, so we packed up and left early the next morning. We haven't been back since.\\n \\nWe've since had another baby. My MIL was pretty helpful, staying at our house through the labor until I came home. She took time off work and tried to be as helpful as she could.\\n \\nJust after that, though, my husband and MIL got into a big fight (which they never do). When he asked her to come for a night to help bring him to a doctor appointment, she said she would only if we brought our newborn and 2-year-old to an upcoming family reunion. Thirty people would be there, many having traveled, so because of Covid we kindly said we weren't comfortable with that arrangement and we'd find an alternative ride. My MIL blew up.\\n \\nI removed her from my social media accounts but send daily pics of the grandkids. This crushed her. She went off the map with intense sadness, texting that she was crying all day. We met with her a couple of times to discuss new boundaries: We will never force the kids to do something unless it's best for them first; we have to have an open dialogue from now on about feelings; if she wants time with the kids she needs to initiate it.)\\n \\nWe also listed a number of dangerous situations Grandpa put our toddler in and admitted we were avoiding visiting them and would continue to do so until he could assure us that he would keep things age-appropriate for them for now on. She secretly recorded us during the meeting and told us afterwards she was showing Grandpa the recording. His response was that he would not change, no matter what, but wanted to think it through. Whatever that means.\\n \\nCut to today, five months later. My relationship with my MIL is cold and distant. She comes down to visit, takes our now 3-year-old out on Grandma trips, and leaves the next day. I don't go out of my way to make her feel needed or included. (I also don't like her, and I'm open about that to my husband, which has caused conflict.)\\n \\nSince our open dialogue about open dialogues, nothing's changed. When she visits, it's for the kids and that's it. I don't feel like I can trust her again and I honestly don't want to try, but I feel like it's just a dark cloud following us now.\\n \\nWhat more can I do?\\n \\n\\u2014 End of My Rope\\n \\nDear End,\\n \\nI have no issues with you putting down boundaries for the safety and comfort of your children, and I also don't necessarily object to the social media blocking, even though I'd have probably taken a different approach; I would have been just as frustrated as you that my posts and parenting choices were being used against me. And recording you secretly to share with Grandpa was\\u2014even if she didn't realize it\\u2014pretty brazen. I'd be icy for a long time after that.\\n \\nBut, I do take issue if MIL is making the effort to play by the rules and you aren't extending her an olive branch in return. Her conduct has not been perfect, but your husband has made it clear that he wants to keep a relationship with her. So, I think the question isn't 'what more can you do,' but what are you willing to do going forward?\\n \\nIt's hard to tell from your letter what you want from the relationship. You say you don't like her, but you are resentful that her visits are only about the kids, and nothing more. You say nothing has changed, but she is making an effort to come spend time with your toddler (initiated by her, according to your wishes) and has not pressured you to see more of the family. You expect her to have open dialogue about her feelings, but you admit to not making her feel wanted in your home. I 'm not trying to be combative. I completely understand that your trust was violated by both Grandpa and MIL. I'm just confused about what it is that you want your relationship to be.\\n \\nMy mom has always reminded me, when I am struggling with family relationships, that as the mother of the grandkids/nephews/etc., I hold the power; I am the gatekeeper for whether people see my kids. But with that power comes the responsibility to be gracious and magnanimous whenever possible.\\n \\nI think you need to paint the picture for yourself of what your ideal (yet realistic) relationship with your MIL looks like, and then identify what steps you can take to get there. If you don't want to be closer to her than you are now, then accept your current situation and don't hold it against her. If you want things to be warmer, you'll need to make the first overture. Invite her to stay for a cup of coffee after her Grandma trip and chit chat, just the two of you. If she declines, offer the next time, and the next. Thank her for playing with your son. Start a dialogue of reconciliation and open sharing, rather than putting that onus on her. Relationships are made of these kinds of little moments, and that's where I think you need to begin.\\n \\nNew Year, Same Problems\\n \\nFor an upcoming special edition of Care and Feeding, we want to hear about the messy situations plaguing you that you'd like to shed in the new year. \\nA pet fox corrupting daughter?\\n \\nA 10-year-old behind the wheel?\\n \\nHarsh PTA crackdowns?\\n \\nSubmit your questions anonymously here.\\n (Questions may be edited for publication.)\\n \\nDear Care and Feeding,\\n \\nHow do I regain my 3-year-old's trust? About two weeks ago, my friend 'Bob' was visiting. Bob has a liver condition and carries medication for it\\u2014the sort of stuff that is toxic if taken in the wrong dose. Well, my son 'Albert' got into the medicine bottle (Childproof. Ha!) and swallowed some, he wasn't sure how much.\\n \\nI quickly ran out to the corner store to get an emetic and gave it to Albert in the car. I told him it was candy because I didn't want to waste any time. The emetic worked; Albert threw up all over, and physically, he's been fine.\\n \\nHowever, he remembers how I tricked him and now won't accept anything from me. If I want to give him something, I have to give it to my wife and have her give it to him. She thinks he'll forget about it in a little while, but it's already been two weeks and he hasn't shown any signs of it yet. Am I ever going to be able to fix this?\\n \\n\\u2014 Feeling Failure\\n \\nDear FF,\\n \\nWhen my son was two, he ate his three-year-old cousin's cookie, which greatly put her out. Six months later, she would still mention The Incident whenever my son's name came up. I think now, 18 months later, she's forgotten. Probably.\\n \\nThat anecdote aside, yes, your son will eventually forget, and I don't think it will take 18 months. But there are probably some things you can do to mend the bridge sooner. I think you have two paths you could take, depending on what you've already tried and your kid's disposition.\\n \\nPath one: lean into his refusal by making your wife the sole thing-giver for a period of several weeks. You could even casually eat things he loves when he's around, which your wife and others might accept from you. Hopefully as he sees others interact with you during this period, he'll start to come around.\\n \\nAlternatively, you could address the situation head-on by copping to the lie, apologizing, and making a pact about how you'll handle medicine in the future. You still may have to have the conversation several times before he lets it drop. Remember that this was a major life event for him, so it's natural that he takes a while to process it.\\n \\nFinally, just a note of solidarity to you. It is always such a bummer when a parenting move backfires. Try to console yourself with what a laugh you'll get out of this when Albert is older.\\n \\nCatch Up on Care and Feeding\\n \\n\\u2022\\u00a0\\nIf you missed Sunday's column,\\u00a0\\nread it here\\n.\\n\\u2022 \\nDiscuss this column in the\\u00a0\\nSlate Parenting Facebook group\\n!\\n \\nDear Care and Feeding,\\n \\nI am a single mother with an 8-year-old son, 'Dan.' We're very close with my brother and his family. My brother has two daughters who are 10 and 7. The younger one, 'Lily,' uses a wheelchair. She has very thick glasses that don't fully correct her vision to 20/20 and has poor peripheral vision. She also has ADHD and anxiety, which she received treatment for and manages well.\\n \\nLily and Dan have a lot of the same interests and get along really well. They call themselves best friends. Because of my work schedule, Dan usually goes to my brother's house every day after school and plays with her. However, Dan often expresses his frustrations to me about all the fun things he wants to do with Lily that he can't because of her disabilities. He also feels guilty about feeling frustrated about this.\\n \\nRecently, I took them to a science museum and both Lily and Dan were fascinated by a lot of the exhibits. Unfortunately, some exhibits involved things that Lily couldn't do in her wheelchair. Dan felt uncomfortable participating in them when he knew Lily couldn't. When he came home, he vented to me about how he wished Lily's legs would 'just start working correctly' so that they could do all the fun stuff he wants to do with her. Dan is usually understanding of Lily's physical limitations and neurodivergent quirks when he's with her.\\n \\nI find their friendship really cute. It's also convenient for me because as a single mother, I often rely on my brother's family (my brother, his wife, and his wife's mother who does a lot of childcare for the family) for childcare. I don't feel like I should talk about Dan's frustrations with my brother or his family. They've expressed in the past that they are so grateful that Dan is friends with her and that he sees Lily as a person and not as a wheelchair. Being reduced to one's disabilities is apparently something a lot of disabled children face growing up. How can I guide my son on his relationship with his best friend?\\n \\n\\u2014 Inclusion Matters\\n \\nDear Inclusion,\\n \\nYou are right that a lot of people with disabilities\\u2014no matter their age\\u2014do indeed face an incredible amount of reduction-to-their-disability in society. Discrimination, 'invisibility' and abuse are also pervasive challenges that people with disabilities face on a daily basis. (For a sobering and really insightful glimpse into life with a disability, I highly recommend \\nDisability Visibility\\n, a collection of essays edited by Alice Wong.) But, just because people are treated unkindly for their disabilities doesn't mean a disability shouldn't be acknowledged at all.\\n \\nThe fact of the matter is Lily's mobility disability \\ndoes\\n mean that Dan can't share certain experiences with her. It's unfortunate, but it's also a fact\\u2014and one that Lily is aware of, too. It is OK for Dan to be disappointed by this fact and vent to you about it. (It's not OK for him to express that disappointment to Lily, but I can tell from your letter that you and your son already know that.) Think about it this way: there are a lot of things about our friends' abilities and limits that can frustrate us, not just disabilities. For example, your opposite-sex friend's mom doesn't allow coed sleepovers, or you can't take a certain friend to the pool because they can't swim, etc. Having a disability is just one of many things that make up our identities, and it is OK to acknowledge its impact.\\n \\nOne way you can turn that disappointment into a constructive exercise is to help Dan make a list of cool things he wants to experience that Lily can also do, and try some of those. If those activities involve places like museums, rides, trails, etc. you can check out the destination's accessibility information/resources so that Dan and you know ahead of time what attractions will be successful/available to your whole group. So long as it's OK with her parents, involve Lily in the planning, too!

(TSXV: SGC) ('\\nSolstice\\n', 'we', 'our' or the '\\nCompany\\n') is pleased to provide an update on the exploration program at its Church and Kamuck Projects in the Quetico Subprovince, located approximately 85 km and 200 km NE of Thunder Bay, Ontario, respectively in the actively explored Quetico lithium district.\\n \\nEmerging Quetico Lithium District\\n \\nSpodumene discoveries reported by exploration groups in 2023 are defining a greatly expanded area with high lithium potential within the Quetico subprovince. The Quetico Lithium District is centred around the Georgia Lake Lithium deposit (owned by Rock Tech). In 2023, a new spodumene discovery was reported by Pegmatite One (\\\"\\nPGA\\n\\\"\\n1\\n) west of the Georgia Lake pegmatites and within 15 km of Solstice's \\nChurch Property\\n. Spodumene was also reported in 2023 to the east of Georgia Lake by Tearlach (\\\"\\nTEA\\n\\\") on their Georgina Properties\\n2\\n, immediately adjacent to Solstice's Gathering Lake claims, optioned to Green Technology Metals. Solstice's \\nKamuck Property\\n is located just to the east of these discoveries and exhibits abundant fertility indicators.\\n \\nPrincipal Findings\\n \\nPablo McDonald, Solstice CEO stated, '\\nAfter discovering several 20 to 30m wide pegmatites on the Church Property on the first few days of prospecting, our more in-depth exploration efforts throughout the fall showed a trend of lithium enrichment in alkali feldspars across the southern part of the property, as well as radiometric anomalies that are similar to those seen proximal to spodumene-bearing pegmatites in the region. We have also seen abundant pegmatite on both Kamuck and Church, with promising LIBS readings in an unknown mineral of up to 3.0% Li\\n2\\nO. The combination of positive signs coming out of these properties after initial prospecting show that these areas have the potential to host LCT Pegmatites and I'm therefore very excited to get back on the ground with detailed prospecting and sampling.'\\n \\nBoth properties produced favourable results in 2023, which continues to show promise for Solstice's projects in the Quetico Lithium District:\\n \\nPreliminary exploration at Church in August of 2023, covering less than 5% of the area, delineated five 12-30m-wide pegmatites with quartz, albite and potassium feldspar along with books of muscovite, garnet, and beryl or fluorapatite\\n3\\n.\\nHigh Lithium values in alkali feldspars (50 - 280 ppm using LIBS\\n4\\n) define a lithium-enriched trend along the Southern end of Church. This trend largely aligns with the anomalies in radiometric data which continue to the north of Church and are spatially related to the Pegmatite One spodumene occurrence.\\nLIBS analysis of unknown minerals at both Church and Kamuck have registered strong lithium responses. At Church, readings of up to 1.18% Li\\n2\\nO in an unknown mineral are coincident with the southern radiometric anomaly. At Kamuck, readings of up to 3.0% Li\\n2\\nO in a green mineral, likely fluorapatite were recorded after only one day of prospecting\\n5\\n.\\n \\nDetailed Results\\n \\nFurther exploration of the area included prospecting and sampling throughout the fall of 2023, whole rock geochemical and LIBS analysis. Further study of publicly available geological and geophysical data has also helped to reveal promising geochemical and structural trends related to pegmatites on the Project.\\n \\nKey results include:\\n \\nAnalysis of Ontario Geological Survey (OGS) radiometric data\\n6\\n show Equivalent Uranium ('\\neU\\n') anomalies that are related to a major structure \\u2013 the Black Sturgeon River Fault ('\\nBSRF\\n') and related faults which are also developed near Pegmatite One's recent spodumene discovery and other known pegmatites in the area (see \\nFigure 1\\n). The eU anomalies are interpreted by Solstice to be associated with a potassic granite source intrusion(s) which may also be the source of related pegmatites on the Property. Some pegmatites in the area are known to be uranium-bearing\\n7\\n.\\nGeochemical analysis using LIBS has identified a lithium-enriched trend of over 50 ppm Li in alkali feldspars (50 \\u2013 280ppm), from potassic granites or pegmatites. Similar readings in alkali feldspars \\nhave been shown to be reliable indicators for the presence of spodumene in known lithium districts\\n8,9\\n.\\nSampling to date at Church suggests that elevated lithium in alkali feldspars is largely coincident with the pronounced eU anomaly. More regionally, the Pegmatite One spodumene occurrence and mapped (OGS) fertile pegmatites also display a close spatial relationship with eU anomalies (see inset, \\nFigure 1\\n)\\neU anomalies coincident with lithium enrichment in alkali feldspars at Church suggest potential fractionation outwards from core potassic (and uranium-enriched) source intrusion area(s). This is supported by low K/Rb ratios (a measure of fractionation) in pegmatites sampled to date outside the main area of eU enrichment (\\nFigure 1\\n).\\nLIBS analysis in an unknown mineral has registered \\nreadings of up to 5,470ppm Li\\n (\\n1.18% Li\\n2\\nO\\n) in a newly identified area of pegmatites in the SE area of the Project.\\n \\nFigure 1: Church Project exploration results\\n \\nMuch of the Church Property has not been prospected or sampled. Based on the promising results that are clearly tied to eU anomalies that have analogs to the North along the BSRF, these areas have the potential to host LCT Pegmatites, and therefore the next step on the Property will be to cover the rest of this area with detailed prospecting and sampling.\\n \\nKamuck Property\\n \\nSolstice acquired the 31km\\n2\\n Kamuck Property in October 2023 after a one-day property due diligence examination. Key observations include:\\n \\nConfirmation of a well exposed pegmatite swarm covering a 1km by 800m area which was initially identified using aerial imagery (\\nFigure 2\\n). The pegmatite is typically coarse-grained plagioclase feldspar with abundant indicators of fertility including books of muscovite, garnet, cordierite, and possible fluorapatite\\n10\\n. The pegmatite swarm correlates with a pronounced ENE and NNE trending, 3.9km long eU radiometric anomaly\\n1\\n1\\n that satellite imagery shows has extensive exposure. \\nElevated Li content (LIBS readings of \\nup to 3.0% Li\\n2\\nO\\n) in a green mineral, likely fluorapatite\\n1\\n2\\n. According to Selway et.al., '\\nthe presence of blue or green Mn-rich fluorapatite indicates that the pegmatite has economic potential for Li-Cs-Ta\\n'\\n1\\n3\\n. The fluorapatite also contains up to 1.02% Mn (1.31% MnO) which is also noted as a component in other fluorapatites in LCT pegmatites.\\nThe pegmatite swarm lies at the western end of, and is coincident with, part of a prominent ~3km ENE-trending eU anomaly interpreted to be a potential fault structure along which additional pegmatites may be developed. This, and other prominent structures and eU anomalies will be prospected in the 2024 field season.\\nUpon seeing positive correlations between eU anomalies and lithium values in alkali feldspars at Church and Kamuck, Solstice subsequently staked a strong eU anomaly adjacent to Kamuck to bring its entire area to 43 km\\n2\\n.\\n \\nFigure 2: Kamuck Property, showing eU responses and individual samples on prospected areas identified by aerial imagery\\n \\nSolstice Selected to Received $200,000 Ontario Government Grant\\n \\nThe Company has also been selected to receive grant funding of up to $200,000 under the Ontario Junior Exploration Program ('OJEP') from the Ontario Government. This amount will cover up to 50% of eligible exploration costs, to a maximum of $200,000 in respect of expenditures incurred by the Company during the period from April 1, 2023 to February 15, 2024. The Company also received a $200,000 OJEP Grant for the exploration program on its SLP Project in 2023.\\n \\n'\\nAs the global search for critical minerals intensifies, our government's Ontario Junior Exploration Program (OJEP) gives us a major competitive advantage and ensures Ontario will be a leading global supplier of critical minerals\\n,' said George Pirie, Minister of Mines. '\\nOur government's $200,000 investment in Solstice Gold's Church Project will help develop this promising lithium deposit in northwestern Ontario and create jobs. Lithium is a vital component in the manufacturing of electric vehicles, and it is great to see companies exploring for the critical minerals that will help us build an integrated supply chain in Ontario.\\n'\\n \\n'\\nWe would like to thank the Ontario Government for the approval for funding under the OJEP program. We look forward to using these funds to extend our exploration program at our Church Project, which is in the heart of the Quetico Lithium District, only 85km from the Port of Thunder Bay\\n' commented Pablo McDonald, Solstice CEO.\\n \\nData Sources and References\\n \\nLIBS: \\n \\nInitial analysis of samples from Solstice's site visit were completed using a Sci-Labs Z-300 LIBS (laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy) analyzer. Lithium data were calibrated against LCT pegmatite standard GTA-06. Data should be considered semi-quantitative, but are independently confirmed by whole rock data (K/Rb values, for example). In addition, at least four analyses per mineral were carried out (two in 'Geochem' mode, two in 'Element Pro' mode).\\n \\nWhole Rock Analysis:\\n \\nSample material weighing from 1 to 2 kg is selected and placed in plastic bags. Sample details and a GPS coordinate were recorded. A sample tag with the sample number is tied with flagging tape to an example of the sample and left in the field. A duplicate sample tag is placed in the sample bag. The samples were delivered directly to the lab in Thunder Bay, Ontario by Solstice employees. Analysis method: Peroxide (Total) Fusion, ICP-OES & ICP-MS with 55 elements that include detection levels for Li of 15ppm - 50,000ppm and Rb of 0.4ppm - 5,000ppm (ActLabs code UT7). Sodium peroxide fusion provides total metal recovery and is effective for the decomposition of sulphides and refractory minerals which are common to pegmatites.\\n \\nReferences:\\n \\nPegmatite One News Release: Pegmatite One Discovers High-Grade Lithium Mineralization During Extended Exploration at Frazer Lake Mound Property, August 2, 2023.\\nTearlach News Release: Tearlach Resources Discovers Spodumene on Georgina Properties, October 18, 2023\\nXRD or other additional work will be required to definitively identify this mineral.\\nSee 'LIBS' under 'Data Sources and References' above for a detailed description of LIBS procedures.\\nIt is important to note that these unknown minerals occur only in trace amounts and their significance is an indicator of fractionation and lithium pegmatite potential.\\nOntario Geological Survey, Ontario Airborne Geophysical Surveys: Aeromagnetic and gamma-ray Spectrometric Data, Lake Nipigon Embayment Area.

      "            \"summary\": \"If you're tired of getting stuck in line for the latest sneaker drops or just need an inexpensive generalized set of proxy services, MarsProxies is worth checking out. Streamlined for the process of shopping online but still plenty capable in most arenas we tested, MarsProxies is a service built for sneakerheads, by sneakerheads, with all the bells and whistles you need to make sure you don't miss out on that next pair of Air Force Ones. It's among the better proxy services we've tested overall, though the lack of a publicly accessible privacy policy keeps it from earning our Editors' Choice award.\\n\\nHow Much Does MarsProxies Cost?\\n\\nMarsProxies follows a standard proxy pricing model, including \\u00e0 la carte, by-the-gigabyte pricing for residential customers, as well as static residential proxies and data center proxies.\\n\\nMarsProxies offers five different proxy products. These include Obsidian Proxies (made for most major shopping destinations), Nike Obsidian Proxies (proxies specifically designed to work with Nike's shoe purchase network), ISP Proxies (high-speed, low block rate proxies), Ultra Residential (for daily streaming and geo-unblocking), and Retail Obsidian (specifically designed for Amazon, Aldi, and several other online retailers).\\n\\nI signed up for the Ultra Residential plan, which starts at $3.75 per GB and can be discounted to just $0.75 per gigabyte if you purchase a plan with 500GB or more. This is easily the best per-GB pricing I've seen for a proxy service yet, and it undercuts the next cheapest option, IPRoyal, by half (IPRoyal starts at $7 per GB and has roughly similar discounts for larger plans).\\n\\nStatic residential proxies are also available via the Mars ISP Residential Proxies plan, which starts at $2.50 per proxy for a 30-day license. Compare this with IPRoyal, which charges $2.70 per proxy per month. Longer-term MarsProxies plans (60-day and 90-day) net you discounts, depending on the length of your term and the number of IP addresses you purchase.\\n\\nIf you do a lot of streaming or want to use your proxy strictly to watch geo-restricted content, the Residential Proxy plan is your best bet. While the numbers of available countries and proxy blocks are more limited than with the per-GB option, trying to stream content on a per-gigabyte basis (especially at the above prices) would quickly put a dent in your wallet.\\n\\nMarsProxies doesn't offer a free trial for its paid services, nor is there a free option. If you want to get on the network in any capacity, you have to sign up for a paid plan. The company accepts payment by all major credit cards, but that's all. If you want to pay using alternative options like AllPay or cryptocurrencies, you need to default to a different service altogether.\\n\\nMarsProxies also caters to data center customers with its Obsidian Data Center plan. However, the pricing structure for these proxies varies greatly depending on the number you want, the country you want the IP addresses to originate from, and the features you want attached to your plan. The base-level pricing starts at $1.00 per IP address per day, and a 30-day plan starts at $1.75 per IP address.\\n\\nWhat Do You Get for Your Money With MarsProxies?\\n\\nMarsProxies has a far more extensive collection of features than your standard web proxy, including over 186 countries of coverage, more than 500,000 addresses to select from, and additional options like timed auto-rotation of your IP and city-specific IP address selection.\\n\\nIf you set up your proxy on your home router, you can connect unlimited devices to MarProxies' network. All its available plans offer the option to connect through the HTTPS protocol or SOCKS5. Head over to our proxy explainer for a primer on what those protocols mean for you and your internet security.\\n\\nAs a proxy company that is first and foremost geared toward sneakerheads, the majority of MarsProxies services and features are set up to work with major sneaker-shopping destinations. So deep is its devotion to sneaker shoppers that there is an entire plan structure specifically built to work with Nike's website. Buying sneakers online relies on a series of lines and a \\\"first-come, first-serve\\\" structure. MarsProxies IP addresses work to give you the best chance at getting a good position in line, either guaranteeing your ability to get the latest shoe drop or, at the very least, weighting things more heavily in your favor the more IP addresses you sign up for.\\n\\nYour Privacy With MarsProxies\\n\\nMarsProxies is based out of Belize. I couldn't find any publicly available information about the company's terms and conditions, its privacy policy, or how it handles data requests from local or international authorities.\\n\\nI put in a request with the company's internal support team via the chat module on the home page, and as of this writing, I still haven't heard anything back. This is a major mark against the service and could be the deciding factor for users despite its strong performance and value proposition.\\n\\nIf I receive any information back from the company regarding its data privacy practices, I'll update this review accordingly.\\n\\nHands On With MarsProxies\\n\\nI had no trouble configuring the MarsProxies IP address on my test PC and within Firefox, though I had to rely on FoxyProxy to get the connection live. Unlike IPRoyal, MarsProxies doesn't offer any of its own browser extensions for customers to use.\\n\\nOnce I was provided with the proxy address and entered the username and password via the MarsProxies dashboard (pictured below), I used it to configure my desktop and web traffic to route through the company's network manually. I connected to Denver IP from the closest address to my test machine in Boulder, Colorado, roughly 20 miles away. I used the Firefox browser extension to implement the proxy in our browser, though you can also go through this process manually, which changes depending on your preferred web browser. The Firefox extension allows you to create new proxy profiles for each country you want to connect from and easily copy and paste them from the dashboard into the extension.\\n\\nStreaming media is important for consumers, but streaming services like Netflix sometimes block or limit access when you use a VPN. This is why you may prefer proxy services, as their much larger IP address blocks make it easier to quickly cycle through options until you find one that works freely. I tried regions I normally include when testing Netflix on VPNs, including the US, Canada, the UK, Australia, and Japan. All were left completely Open on the MarsProxies residential proxy network. Sometimes, I find VPN services marked as Limited instead, as I did with Storm Proxies. (Check here for our definitions of Open and Limited.)\\n\\nWhether or not you'll be able to stream your content at a quality level that's worth the investment of a proxy is another issue entirely. That's a function of performance, and, as you'll see below, proxies may not be the best choice.\\n\\nMarsProxies Speed and Performance\\n\\nTo understand a proxy's impact on your internet experience, I run a series of tests using Google's speed test tool and find a percent change between test results with and without the proxy running.\\n\\nIn testing, I found that MarsProxies had virtually no effect on upload speeds. Download speeds, however, were more greatly affected by the server hop.\\n\\nAs you can see above, while connected to a local Denver proxy from Boulder, CO, my test system, which is hardwired into a home router, reported a download speed reduction of 99.76%. Roughly 11 megabits of bandwidth is usable but far from ideal. For anyone who wants acceptable speeds while also protecting their originating IP address, a VPN might still be a better bet overall, given that most of our testing on those products shows drastically less speed reduction than what we see here.\\n\\nRemember that network connections are variable, so your experience may differ. These results are more of a snapshot for comparison than a final verdict on performance. We believe that features and overall value are far more important than speed, and we discourage you from judging a proxy service solely on these results.\\n\\nA Budget-Friendly Proxy With Premium Features\\n\\nMarsProxies is one of the better proxies we've tested. With affordable and customizable plans, it has something for everyone who needs a proxy service. Whether you're shopping for the latest Nike drops, comparing prices on Amazon, or pulling SEO reports for your publication platform, MarsProxies has both the IP count and the pricing structure to cater to many users. Still, its opaque privacy practices may (rightfully) give you pause. So, while MarsProxies is an excellent service, it isn't quite an Editors' Choice winner.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Sega\\n\\n\\nOn January 4, I received an email I had both been anticipating and dreading for months. My copy of \\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth\\n, one of my most anticipated games of 2024, had dropped into my inbox. Usually, that moment would give me a jolt of energy. I love critiquing games that have real substance, and I was still chewing on 2020's unforgettable \\nYakuza: Like a Dragon \\nseveral years later. That RPG tells a thematically rich story about an unlikely hero finding his confidence amid a quest to take on Japan's criminal underworld.\\n \\n \\nContents\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n \\n\\n\\nBut the desire to dive into the new game would come with one major caveat\\n: I needed to give up the next three weeks of my life for it.\\n\\n\\nThe game's developer, Ryu Ga Gotoku, suggested that it would take 80 to 100 hours just to zip through the main story without stopping to enjoy side content. The studio's boss, Masayoshi Yokoyama, went one step further and claimed that it would make players 'sick' if they tried to binge it all.\\n\\n\\nUnfortunately for me, I'd have 19 days if I wanted to have a review out when the January 23 review embargo lifted. With no way of knowing how long I'd be spending in the streets of Honolulu City, my anxiety kicked in as I entered the same marathon mindset that Yokoyama had advised against.\\n\\n\\nIt's easy to blame this crunch on untenable PR timelines; there's a long history of press not getting enough time with massive RPGs like\\n \\nBaldur's Gate 3\\n. The reality here, though, is that my fate was somewhat self-imposed. I could have spaced out my play time more instead of settling in for long sessions and still finished with time to spare. I know that my bosses wouldn't have cared if we had opted to skip a review entirely, as it's not exactly a mainstream game. The only thing compelling me to push myself so hard was me.\\n\\n\\nIt only took a few days of a lost week for me to reckon with an uncomfortable truth about myself: I'm a workaholic. The ultimate irony of that revelation? I wouldn't recognize it until I saw myself in the Dragon of Dojima himself, Kazuma Kiryu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth\\n tells the tale of two heroes whose journeys contrast with one another. When the story begins, the bright-eyed Ichiban Kasuga is living his perfect life. Years removed from successfully dissolving two major Yakuza families, he's found his true calling in a dream job at . He's dedicated his life to finding respectable jobs for reformed criminals impacted by the Great Dissolution. He's a perfect employee, giving as much of himself to the gig as possible.\\n\\n\\nThat quickly comes crashing down when his criminal past comes to light, and  unceremoniously lays him off without a second thought. A painful scene sees Kasuga bidding farewell to his beloved co-workers on his way out, only to be met with lukewarm goodbyes. Kasuga may be the most passionate person for the job, but it turns out he's as expendable as anyone else in Kamurocho.\\n\\n\\nSega\\n\\n\\nReal-life events make this strong opening perhaps even more timely than developer Ryu Ga Gotoku originally intended. Seemingly endless waves of layoffs have rocked tech companies over the past few years. The video game industry has been especially impacted, with studios big and small \\nlaying off thousands of workers\\n in total.\\n\\n\\nGames media, my own industry, has not been spared by the wrath of big business. Over the past two years, I've watched countless peers and friends lose their jobs despite delivering top-tier work. Often, these moments would come in the form of scattershot layoffs. One day, you'd log online to discover a writer whose work you respect had lost their job. Other cases were more dire, like The Washington Post \\nsunsetting its video game site Launcher\\n entirely, leaving some of the best journalists working today out to dry. Whether or not the websites were successful didn't seem to matter; when executives needed to find money, they were more than ready to loot it out of hardworking employees.\\n\\n\\nIn this volatile state, working within games media feels like being trapped on a beach as the tide slowly rises. All you can do is survive as long as possible, but it feels inevitable that the ocean will swallow you eventually.\\n\\n\\nI'm no stranger to layoffs. I've seen countless 'reorgs' even before I was working in games full-time, and I've been the victim of two layoffs (and a contract ending early) myself. One saw the entire quality-assurance department I was part of wiped away, right after we were asked to automate our own jobs by coding a website bug-testing script. Another was a marketing gig at a tumultuous tech startup where a new CEO took the reins from the company's founder and began routinely stripping talent away. In the years leading up to my layoff, I watched too many friends pack their boxes \\u2014 some forced out of their jobs by incompetent executives who later lied about the circumstances. Experiences like that have a way of putting one in survival mode.\\n\\n\\nWriting wasn't just a job, but a lifeline.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's perhaps how I started to develop bad work habits when I finally broke into games media after over a decade of struggle. The climb felt like a Sisyphean task, and once I got in, I was terrified of watching that boulder roll down the hill again. In my early freelance days, I was sometimes putting in 12 hours a day as I juggled three part-time writing gigs at once. In my head, it felt like I was on a do-or-die timeline: I needed to establish myself before I was cast out into obscurity again. That's how you end up obsessively playing 60 hours of \\nLike a Dragon\\n in a week.\\n\\n\\nThat's the simple explanation, at least. The more complicated layer is that my full pivot into games media just so happened to come at the tail-end of a five-year relationship and the start of COVID-19 lockdowns. Suddenly locked in a one-bedroom apartment alone, work provided a convenient way to distract myself from my thoughts. The clacking of my mechanical keyboard filled the eerie silence of total isolation. Long days felt less lonely when I could convince myself that everything I wrote could be sparking a conversation with someone on the other side of my screen. Writing wasn't just a job, but a lifeline.\\n\\n\\nNaturally, I saw myself in Ichiban Kasuga. \\nInfinite Wealth\\n's opening is crushing for someone who has lost a job they care about. Kasuga, a hero who is incapable of insincerity, goes above and beyond in his job at . In an early sequence, he helps a petty thief get on the straight and narrow by using his skills to put local business' security systems to the test. The reformed criminal is filled with gratitude, and it's clear that Kasuga takes it to heart. He's built his self-worth around helping others. It all matters.\\n\\n\\nSo it's a familiar tragedy when all of that disappears and Kasuga is left directionless after being suddenly thrust into a midlife crisis. An ill-advised marriage proposal only further dashes his hope for a life outside of that job. In the low period that follows, Kasuga vows to connect with his loved ones, find his long-lost family, and define his purpose on his own terms rather than someone else's. It's an inspiring bit of character growth, but Kasuga doesn't arrive at it by himself. Both he and I need to see what we're in danger of becoming first.\\n\\n\\nEnter Kazuma Kiryu.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhen we meet Kiryu, the Yakuza's lovable himbo, he drops a bombshell on Kasuga: He's been diagnosed with cancer and only has six months to live. It's an especially shocking reveal in the context of a video game. Despite going through mortal danger on a regular basis, long-running game protagonists rarely kick the bucket. When a series becomes popular enough, an iconic hero turns into an eternal mascot who is too valuable to lay to rest. Maybe Kiryu would fade away when developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio decides to stop making \\nLike a Dragon games\\n, but in our minds, he'd always be prowling the streets of Japan looking for a fight.\\n\\n\\nInfinite Wealth\\n breaks that safety net by putting a very human expiration date on Kiryu's life. Whether it's by the end of this game or in a sequel, Kazuma Kiryu \\nis \\ngoing to die. We, as players, only have a limited amount of time left with our old friend. We also learn that Kiryu isn't helping his case, as the Dragon of Dojima is refusing treatment entirely. In fact, he's seemingly accelerating his demise when he tells his concerned pals that he intends to keep working to disband the criminal underworld until he croaks. He pushes his body to the limits for the first half of the story until it collapses in on itself, forcing him to rest up in Japan as he grows weaker.\\n\\n\\nSega\\n\\n\\nWhile I initially related to Kasuga, with his bright-eyed optimism and eagerness to do right by his loved ones, I'd soon accept a sadder truth that I had more in common with Kiryu. For well over a decade now, I've been operating under the assumption that I will still be working on my deathbed. Long-term financial planning always felt like a lost cause, because I never intended to retire. On top of that, I've been brushing off underlying medical worries for years due to my busy work schedule. A family history with Factor V Leiden, a blood clot condition that can be fatal, looms over me as I keep kicking a formal diagnosis down the line.\\n\\n\\nI often find myself thinking about Muppet creator Jim Henson and his untimely death in 1990. Henson died of toxic shock syndrome brought on by a case of streptococcus pneumoniae that he refused to get checked out while suffering from fatigue and a sore throat. When he began coughing up blood one night in May 1990, he still didn't want to interrupt his work with a hospital visit. He finally agreed to go a few hours later, but those lost moments would prove critical;. Going to the hospital a few hours earlier could have saved his life, \\naccording to New York Hospital ICU director David Gelmont\\n.\\n\\n\\nIt's not that I romanticize Henson's death \\u2014 well, perhaps just a little in my younger days. It just always felt more like a sad reality I was getting dragged toward. No matter how much work I produced, I was rarely keeping up with the cost of living. And with such instability in the job market, it always felt like I needed a bigger cushion to fall back on when the inevitable ax dropped. The idea of buying a home is still a pipe dream in my mid-30s, and I still can't imagine a world where I'd have both the time and money to raise children. I've often found myself frustrated by the capitalist spiral I'm stuck in. 'Why do I have to work nonstop in order to live long enough to keep working?' I ask myself frequently.\\n\\n\\nOne can read the title Infinite Wealth as a nod to that cycle: To survive in today's world is to be locked in a loop. You need to work to make money to live so you can work to make money \\u2026 so on and so on forever. Kiryu and Kasuga are even subtle victims of that in the game's box art, where they stand back to back, trapped inside a golden infinity sign.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMidway through playing\\n Infinite Wealth\\n, all of this self-reflection starts to flood in. The irony isn't lost on me. I'm bingeing a game that I'm assigned to review for work, a game that's begging me to slow down, but that is filled with dozens of hours of side content it's encouraging me to play. It's my own personal infinity loop.\\n\\n\\nDespite having a blast with \\nInfinite Wealth\\n itself, I start to feel exhausted after a few days. One long session leaves me dizzy when I finally decide to take a break. I'm notably irritable by the end of my first week with it, becoming unreasonably frustrated over an Amazon shipping snafu. My body becomes sensitive from the underlying stress of it all; a supportive hug from my girlfriend elicits an instinctive twitch in my shoulders, like a bucking bronco protecting itself from outsiders. The longer I stare at Kiryu's face, the more I see myself staring back.\\n\\n\\nWhen would I stop writing down ideas on a bucket list and actually start checking them off?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe last days of my playthrough aren't nearly as long or arduous, but that's perhaps because I'm spending those days pacing back-and-forth so much. Both Kasuga and Kiryu's stories resonate with me the more I play, inviting me to see two separate sides of myself. On one side, there's the overeager busybody who can't help but overburden himself because he believes that work defines him. The other side is a career loner who just wants to be left alone while he keeps his head down in an endless mission. It's only through working with one another that both men realize that there's more they want from life, whether that be love, friendship, or forgiveness.\\n\\n\\nI've been working through the same epiphany for the past month. While I was visiting family in Massachusetts over Christmas break, my mother took me to visit my grandmother. It had been at least a year since I'd seen her last, and my mother warned me that a lot had changed in that time. She's 99 years old and living with a case of dementia that's destroyed her memory. Her kids finally moved her into a memory care unit weeks before Christmas after accepting the severity of her condition, an inevitability they'd put off for years.\\n\\n\\nI thought I'd be prepared to see her. The last time I did, she spoke gibberish for an hour, frequently stopping to tell me how nice it is that the prison I was in let me out for a day (I was not, and have never been, incarcerated). This visit was entirely different. She didn't know who my mother or I were, and hardly registered that we were there at all. She mostly stared off into the distance, occasionally mumbling out a non sequitur. I sat with her patiently, both glad that she was finally getting the care she needed and quietly terrified. My mother's memory and focus had begun to slip too. Judging by family history, mine would too someday.\\n\\n\\nSega\\n\\n\\nI wasn't directly facing death like Kiryu, but I became self-aware that there would come a day where I'd simply run out of time to get everything I want out of this life. Though I hope to have some good decades before then, time no longer felt infinite, as it had for so much of my life. I wouldn't always have these healthy days that I so often take for granted, just as I won't always have \\nanother Like a Dragon adventure\\n starring Kiryu. Why spend so much time giving to work that can only give so much back to me? When would I stop writing down ideas on a bucket list and actually start checking them off?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere's a specific moment where \\nLike a Dragon: Infinite Wealth\\n that would push me to make a change, setting me down a healthier path. In a substory titled Let it Snow, Kiryu encounters an eccentric man who is running around Honolulu City buying snow cones and tossing them into the air. It's played for laughs at first, but it quickly turns tragic. The man's wife is on her deathbed and he's determined to let her see a snowfall one last time despite being in Hawaii. Kasuga, with the help of some adult babies (don't ask), is able to simulate a snowy night from the roof of her apartment. As flakes drift in through the window, the husband breaks down. He apologizes for not giving her this moment sooner. He'd spent so much of their lives working, not accepting that this day would come eventually.\\n\\n\\nShe comforts him from her bed, telling him that all that matters is that they're here together now. She asks him for one last thing as she begins to fade into her last slumber: She'd just like to see her prince smile one more time before she falls asleep. He chokes tears back to deliver that final request as her eyes close and her hand falls limp from his.\\n\\n\\nI don't want to be the man throwing shaved ice into the air; I want to watch the real snow fall with my loved ones while we're still here.\\n \\n Editors' Recommendations\",\n",

The university will also contribute to the creation and acceleration of new startup companies and play a role in leadership and governance of the CO-WY Engine.\\n\\n'The selection of the CO-WY Engine underscores our commitment to developing meaningful solutions to climate change by fostering cutting-edge research and technology,' said Chancellor Phil DiStefano. 'It's a testament to our success in translating impactful research, and we are proud to work with our regional partners in driving innovation for environmental solutions and community impact.'\\n\\nThe CO-WY Engine marks a pivotal moment not only for the Colorado-Wyoming region but also for its partner research universities. The inclusion of the CO-WY Engine in this national effort highlights the region's capacity to transform into a thriving hub of innovation, technology and economic growth.\\n\\n'This funding is more than an investment, it's a statement of faith in our ability to lead the charge against climate change,' said Mike Freeman, CEO of Innosphere Ventures, which led the proposal. 'The CO-WY Engine will be instrumental in bringing technology-driven solutions to life, reshaping our region's approach to climate resilience.'\\n\\nVenture Partners at CU Boulder will contribute access to opportunities for startup funding, such as Destination Startup, and entrepreneurial training. Thematically-aligned research expertise from across the university, such as the Mortenson Center in Global Engineering & Resilience and the Earth Lab, will drive the creation of new climate innovations. The university will also provide performance indicator measurement and economic impact modeling through the Business Research Division of the Leeds School of Business and will develop opportunities to help meet regional workforce development needs.\\n\\n'The CO-WY Engine will build climate resilient communities by combining three of our great strengths at CU Boulder: our research into the challenges of climate, our track record for translating resulting innovations into real-world solutions, and our regional partnerships,' said Bryn Rees, associate vice chancellor for research and innovation and managing director of Venture Partners at CU Boulder and one of five co-principal investigators of the CO-WY Engine.\\n\\nAs but one example, Rees said better wildfire detection could be one outcome of the CO-WY Engine.\\n\\n'If we can detect and respond to a wildfire 20 or 30 minutes earlier, it can make a difference in being able to preserve a building and save many lives\\u2026and maybe also have time to respond early enough to subdue a fire before it gets totally out of control,' Rees said.\\n\\nCU Boulder engineering students survey a home destroyed by the Marshall Fire with structural engineering researcher Erica Fischer (middle, right) from Oregon State University.

This involvement is crucial in translating academic research into tangible, market-ready innovations that address critical environmental and climate challenges facing our region and the world, Rees said. By doing so, the universities will not only contribute to academic knowledge but also play a pivotal role in driving real-world impact, aligning their research goals with the pressing needs of industry, government and communities.\\n\\nMoreover, the NSF grant aims to elevate the role of universities in workforce development. As the region evolves into a leading innovation ecosystem, the demand for a skilled workforce conversant with the latest technologies and practices in climate resilience will surge\\n\\nPartner universities are poised to become central to developing this workforce, offering specialized programs and training to prepare students and professionals for the emerging job market, according to a news release issued by the CO-WY Engine. This role aligns with the mission of these institutions to educate and empower the next generation of leaders and innovators.\\n\\n'Together, with our partners at other research institutions, companies and startup support organizations, we will be creating and accelerating technologies and businesses that directly address challenges like wildfire, water security and drought,' Rees said. 'The unprecedented scope and scale of the NSF program, which encompasses research, innovation and workforce development, positions the CO-WY Engine to make a real difference across our ecosystem.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"The Embark program pairs seasoned entrepreneurs with university technologies to bring those breakthroughs to market in response to urgent societal needs. The recent Embark Showcase was the pinnacle of the program's first year working with selected entrepreneurs to provide IP rights, salary support, grant funds and investor introductions to launch startups with real-world impact.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nA dozen entrepreneurs and 10 groundbreaking innovations took center stage at the recent inaugural Embark Showcase. Attendees got an exclusive look at companies built in the last six months by the first cohort of Embark Entrepreneurs-in-Residence (EIRs). The entrepreneurs shared progress on startups spanning diverse sectors like biotechnology, quantum science, advanced materials and aerospace.\\n\\n\\n'We're showing off the fruits of the Embark program, where they took deep tech and looked at what kind of products there could be and how these companies might have a great future fulfilling real needs,' said Marta Zgagacz, senior director at Venture Partners and co-leader of Embark.\\n \\n'I don't know of another university that actively and directly recruits entrepreneurs to lead their laboratory startups, especially one that lets them pick the tech they want to take to market,' said Stephen Miller, co-leader of Embark and director of venture development at Venture Partners.\\n\\n\\nEvery year, dozens of breakthrough inventions emerge from CU Boulder's research labs. While some are spun out by creators themselves, others are poised to partner with entrepreneurs beyond university walls looking to launch the latest and greatest technologies. Enter Embark, which addresses the need to pair experienced entrepreneurs with promising inventions. 'These were some of our top technologies that we believe could be, and should be, a startup,' said Zgagacz.\\n\\n\\nInitially, over 100 entrepreneurs applied to the\\u00a0\\nEmbark Deep Tech Startup Creator\\n, the newest program by\\u00a0\\n\\n, the university's commercialization arm. Applicants completed an intensive, two-month program including guidance on founding a company based on deep tech from a university lab, customer discovery, business development, types of funding and more. Venture Partners also worked with them to make winning matches between inventors and business minds.\\n\\n\\nAfter exploring a curated portfolio of 50 CU Boulder technologies, applicants pitched commercialization plans to land a six-month EIR spot, including a part-time salary for founding CEOs and up to $100,000 for technology development. Embark is made possible by grants from CU Boulder and the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade.\\n\\n\\nNext, the Venture Partners team selected the 12 EIRS and continued to guide them on resources available on campus and in the community. This first Embark cohort has been in high gear since being chosen and has risen to each challenge, said Zgagacz. 'They do not rest, they take advantage of everything that we suggest to them,' she said. 'It's an all-hands-on-deck approach, how we support our startups,' added Zgagacz. That ongoing support of entrepreneurs that Embark provides is unique to CU Boulder, said Miller. 'Most institutions, once the startup is formed and \\u2018out the door', are typically hands-off.\\u00a0We continue to support them in a multitude of ways,' he said.\\n\\n\\nWhat also stands out to Miller about Embark's EIRs is that they came together early on and 'had a strong commitment to each other's success,' he said. EIR Eva Yao, founder of FLARI, agreed. 'Startup creation is a team sport and deep tech commercialization is no exception,' she said. 'I could not and would not be able to bring this technology to market by myself. I feel uber lucky to be embedded in a community where people are very open and generous with their time and ideas.'\\n\\n\\nWith FLARI, Yao is bringing to market a breathalyzer capable of detecting molecules in breath or air samples. 'My entrepreneurial antenna perked up,' she said, when first learning about the ingenious technology for rapid detection of diseases and contaminants invented by Jun Ye (\\nPhysics\\n) and Qizhong Liang (\\nJILA\\n). The technology brings together two of Yao's interests\\u2014non-invasive diagnostic products and the application of quantum technologies in biomedicine. 'I believe that more accessible, non-invasive diagnostics could really save lives and lower the barrier to early and effective treatment for so many medical conditions,' she said.\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nFellow EIR, Maithreyi Gopalakrishnan, founder and CEO of PrecisionTerra, is bringing to market another potentially life-saving technology. PrecisionTerra is commercializing an algorithm created by\\u00a0Jade Morton, director of the Colorado Center for Astrodynamics Research and head of the Satellite Navigation and Sensing Laboratory in the \\nAnn and H.J. Smead Aerospace Engineering Sciences Department\\n.\\n\\n\\nThe algorithm improves GPS signal coverage in environments like dense cities with tall buildings. That solves a big problem for mapping and autonomous vehicle industries that grapple with poor GPS signal quality in those areas, said Gopalakrishnan. 'What excites me about Dr. Morton's technology is its potential to make autonomous and driver-assist systems in vehicles safer in the future,' she said. 'Improvements to any of the sensors in modern-day vehicles, including GPS sensors, can make a difference in keeping more drivers safe on the road.'\\n\\n\\nAt the Embark showcase, Gopalakrishnan was looking forward 'to celebrating the strides that all of us in the Embark program have made over the past several months,' she said. 'Each of us overcame unique challenges throughout the process, and the showcase [is] a wonderful way to highlight our respective journeys and accomplishments.' Venture Partners' Miller is looking forward to seeing how startup teams are shaping up, who has already raised funding through grants or venture capital, and who will have a product to market first. 'I think it's going to be close!' he said.\\n\\n\\n2023 Embark Entrepreneurs in Residence\\n\\n\\nNate Ashton will lead Regyn Bio in bringing to market an efficient and scalable microwave-based pyrolysis system invented by Zoya Popovic (\\nElectrical, Computer & Energy Engineering\\n).\\n\\n\\nMatthew Bauer will lead Click in bringing to market a small ear device invented by Tam Vu (\\nComputer Science\\n) that provides hands-free computer control that allows users to communicate by 'typing' on their teeth.\\n\\n\\nDavid Beitz and Carl Kalin will lead BioSensor Solutions in bringing to market a biodegradable 2D printed soil sensor invented by Gregory Whiting (\\nMechanical Engineering\\n) that provides real-time measurement data of soil health directly at the source in the field.\\n\\n\\nBrian Dao will lead Coaterra in bringing to market a coated and tunable stent Wei Tan (\\nMechanical Engineering\\n) invented to reduce blood vessel damage and induce quick healing.\\n\\n\\nMaithreyi Gopalakrishnan will lead PrecisionTerra in bringing to market a software solution invented by Jade Morton (\\nAerospace\\n) that only requires a firmware update to improve the signal strength of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers in urban environments.\\n\\n\\nT.

      "            \"summary\": \"CU cinema alum Nick Houy is predicted to be a film-editing Oscar nominee for his work on megahit \\nBarbie\\n \\nNick Houy thought about robbing the Chinese restaurant in Boulder where he worked.\\n\\n\\nHe never would have done it, of course, but that's the joy of storytelling: Exploring your most out-there ideas, asking 'What if?' and making all your friends perform the script you wrote.\\n\\n\\nIt was a heist movie called \\nThe Grand,\\n and Houy and his friends screened it in the gym for their classmates at New Vista High School one day at lunch. They thought nobody would come, but everybody came 'and it was really fun,' Houy recalls. 'We all ate lunch and watched this movie I'd shot on S-VHS and Super 8. I remember thinking, \\u2018The sound in here isn't great, it doesn't look great,' but people seemed to enjoy it anyway.'\\n\\n\\nThe funny thing is, he only wrote, directed and shot the film so he'd have something to edit. That was what he really loved, making sense and stories from hours of footage, shaping scatters of stars into constellations.\\n \\nNow, when the Academy Award nominees for best film editing are announced Tuesday, Houy is \\nwidely predicted\\n to be one of them for his work editing \\nBarbie\\n.\\n\\n\\nFor Houy, a 2004 University of Colorado Boulder graduate in the \\nDepartment of Cinema Studies and Moving Image Arts\\n, editing \\nBarbie\\n marked his third collaboration with director and screenwriter Greta Gerwig. He also edited \\nLady Bird\\n and \\nLittle Women\\n\\u2014and all were\\u00a0exciting artistic challenges in a career that he has steadily grown from that lunchtime screening of \\nThe Grand\\n in his high school gym.\\n\\n\\n'I think of the editor very much as one of the authors of a movie,' Houy says, 'like a co-writer or co-director. As an editor, you're also making the movie. For me, I've always sought out the best footage I can edit. A long time ago I realized that you can do anything with any group of footage, and that's very exciting.'\\n\\n\\nBringing images together\\n\\n\\nHouy grew up in Colorado Springs, the child of two copy editors, so he's always been familiar with the idea of making an artist's work as clean as possible. His parents also were movie fans, and he remembers going to Poor Richard's, a Colorado Springs institution and restaurant/bookstore hybrid with a tiny screening room that was the place for New Wave cinema.\\n\\n\\nWhen he was in third grade, Houy and his mom moved to Boulder\\u2014he attended Mapleton Elementary, and she worked for CU Boulder with an office in Old Main. When he started at New Vista High School, he played drums in a punk band with an ever-changing name and pursued his passion for photography, especially black and white photography. He began thinking about how found images and footage could coalesce into a film with the right editing.\\n\\n\\nHe would rent a camera from community television in the Dairy Arts Center, then rent a room there with two tape decks on which he learned to meld photography and his love of watching films through the art of editing.\\n\\n\\n'I would get Super 8 cameras from yard sales, and I remember meeting old men in parking lots who would have a trunk full of Super 8s, and I'd buy them for like $20,' Houy says. 'I'd shoot Super 8 film and get it processed at (now-closed Jones General Store and Camera) on the Hill.'\\n\\n\\nHe shot movies of every genre\\u2014and they were mostly terrible, he recalls with a laugh, but he was doing it so he could have something to edit.\\n\\n\\n'The first time I started editing even Super 8 movies, I'd have to splice it and put it together. I was just like, \\u2018Yeah, this is what I want to do,'' he says. 'Even if you're doing something like making a video for someone, like for a wedding, just putting a few shots together and adding music, that's really exciting.\\n\\n\\n'Then, if you just go a little further and say, \\u2018What can I do with found footage?' So, I would just go shoot and would make totally random found footage things, which was really fun to do, even more than drawing or being in a band or just shooting stills. It was just more exciting.'\\n \\nWhile he was still in high school, Houy took screenwriting and film production classes at CU Boulder, and concentrated in film production when he became a student there. He remembers rewatching Francois Truffaut's \\nThe 400 Blows\\n in a class taught by \\nErnesto Acevedo-Mu\\u00f1oz\\n and feeling profoundly moved by not only the storytelling, but by how music and images and every other element of filmmaking can come together into something that resonates and lingers.\\n\\n\\nPersistence pays off\\n\\n\\nAfter graduating, Houy moved straight to New York City for the simple reason that he'd always wanted to live there. He had about $1,000 and crashed on a friend's couch while he worked at a video store and, in his free time, went from one post-production house to the next, leaving his resume and asking whether they'd give him work doing, well, anything.\\n\\n\\nFinally, he got a job moving furniture at Post Works, a pre-eminent film post-production facility where he happened to meet a film colorist who hired him to be an assistant conforming editor. In that role, he took a low-resolution film edit and increased the resolution so it could be color-corrected.\\n\\n\\nThat led to a position on Michael Moore's film \\nSicko\\n: '(The film's colorist, Ben Murray) was like, \\u2018Do you want to be my assistant conforming editor at night instead of making coffee?' We would be up all night working on the conform. I would sleep under the theater and never go home because I much preferred to be working on a big movie, and I really lucked out.\\n\\n\\n'The Post Factory in those days, everyone was working there. Michel Gondry was down the hall, the Coen brothers, Sam Mendes\\u2014anyone who was cutting in New York in the mid-2000s. I saw Spike Lee and Godfrey Reggio when I was in college, and I ran into both of them there. I said to them, \\u2018Hey, I saw you speak at CU Boulder.' I literally talked to them about them talking at CU Boulder, which just shows, to students out there, go see those people when they talk, even if it's on Zoom, because you might run into them.'\\n\\n\\nHe bumped into editor Anne McCabe in a Post Factory hallway when she was working on \\nAdventureland\\n and mentioned how much he loved one of her previous films, \\nYou Can Count on Me\\n. 'And then I just kind of followed her around, saying, \\u2018Please can I be your assistant editor?' for like a year,' Houy remembers.\\n\\n\\nShe hired him to work on \\nTop Five,\\n starring Chris Rock, which Houy considers one of his biggest breaks. Another was his experience working as an apprentice editor on 2008's \\nThe Lucky Ones\\n with editor Naomi Geraghty.\\n\\n\\nIt was while working on \\nThe Lucky Ones\\n that he was told one day that he needed to go pick up a mini fridge from another cutting room and bring it to the cutting room where he was working at the time, because his colleagues didn't want to trek to the kitchen constantly. While he was grabbing the fridge, he met another apprentice editor named Jennifer Lame (who edited \\nOppenheimer\\n and is also considered an Academy Award frontrunner for film editing) and they hit it off, becoming good friends.\\n\\n\\nLame ended up editing \\nFrances Ha,\\n starring Greta Gerwig and directed by Noah Baumbach, and she became Baumbach's editor. When Gerwig wrote the script for \\nLady Bird\\n, Lame recommended 'her friend Nick' to edit the film, and a creative partnership was born.\\n \\nIt was while partnering with Gerwig on \\nLittle Women\\n that he realized he'd reached a point in his career of working on Movies with a capital M: 'When we got the first round of dailies, the first shot was of a horse and carriage pulling up outside a house, and that's when I was like, \\u2018Oh, this is a \\nmovie\\n movie.''\\n\\n\\nMovies that people love watching\\n\\n\\nBarbie\\n saw him ascending to another level of his career\\u2014it was a comedy (which he'd never really worked with before), it had elaborate, choreographed dance sequences (which he'd never cut before) and had not only an enormous studio budget, but even more enormous expectations from fans worldwide.\\n\\n\\n'We knew we had one thing against us: Comedies just don't do well at the box office these days,' Houy says. 'That's the ethos of the industry, so we already were worried. But I remember reading the script and almost crying. Only Greta and Noah can write scripts like that, so I knew we had it. So, then the challenge was just to make sure we did all of that justice\\u2014these big comedy moments and big emotional moments, and huge songs by huge artists.'\\n\\n\\nAlthough he could have, Houy never visited the \\nBarbie\\n sets in London or Los Angeles, preferring instead to 'feel like I'm as close to the audience member as I can be at all times,' he says. 'I want to experience the film like an audience member, and an audience member has never walked onto that set. I want to be as fresh as possible, so I'm cutting from a place of me as the audience member. I want to make a movie that I want to watch.'\\n\\n\\nThe film finished shooting on July 21, 2022, and was released July 21, 2023, so factoring in that a film must be completed at least a month before its release, Houy and his colleagues had just 10 and a half months to complete the movie with visual effects, music and everything else.\\n\\n\\n'It was insane, but I'm very proud of that,' he says.\\n\\n\\nHouy currently is lending editing support on \\nBob Marley: One Love\\n and taking a bit of a breath following the enormous hit that \\nBarbie\\n became. Reflecting on it, 'I will always see things I wish we'd done differently,' Houy says.\\n\\n\\n'The old adage is you're never done; you either run out of time or money or both. I always want to keep working to make a movie better, until we run out of money or time, so that when I watch it again, I can be really proud of it. I just want to make movies that people love watching.'\\n\\n\\nTop image: Warner Bros.

'Imagine if these patterns continued to swirl and dance no matter how long you watched.'\\n \\nResearchers still need to run experiments in the lab to make sure that these never-ending swirls really are possible. But the group's results are a major step forward for physicists seeking to create materials that remain out of balance, or equilibrium, for long periods of time\\u2014a pursuit known as 'ergodicity breaking.'\\n\\n\\nThe team's findings \\nappeared this week\\n in the latest issue of 'Physical Review Letters.'\\n\\n\\nQuantum memory\\n\\n\\nThe study, which includes co-authors David Stephen and Oliver Hart, postdoctoal researchers in physics at CU Boulder,\\u00a0hinges on a common problem in quantum computing. \\u00a0\\n\\n\\nNormal computers run on 'bits,' which take the form of zeros or ones. Nandkishore explained that quantum computers, in contrast, employ 'qubits,' which can exist as zero, one or, through the strangeness of quantum physics, zero and one at the same time. Engineers have made qubits out of a wide range of things, including individual atoms trapped by lasers or tiny devices called superconductors.\\n\\n\\nBut just like that cup of coffee, qubits can become easily mixed up. If you flip, for example, all of your qubits to one, they'll eventually flip back and forth until the entire chip becomes a disorganized mess.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nIn the new research, Nandkishore and his colleagues may have figured a way around that tendency toward mixing. The group calculated that if scientists arrange qubits into particular patterns, these assemblages will retain their information\\u2014even if you disturb them using a magnetic field or a similar disruption. That could, the physicist said, allow engineers to build devices with a kind of quantum memory.\\n\\n\\n'This could be a way of storing information,' he said. 'You would write information into these patterns, and the information couldn't be degraded.'\\n\\n\\nTapping into geometry\\n\\n\\nIn the study, the researchers used mathematical modeling tools to envision an array of hundreds to thousands of qubits arranged in a checkerboard-like pattern.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nThe trick, they discovered, was to stuff the qubits into a tight spot. If qubits get close enough together, Nadkishore explained, they can influence the behavior of their neighbors, almost like a crowd of people trying to squeeze themselves into a telephone booth. Some of those people might be standing upright or on their heads, but they can't flip the other way without pushing on everyone else.\\n\\n\\nThe researchers calculated that if they arranged these patterns in just the right way, those patterns might flow around a quantum computer chip and never degrade\\u2014much like those clouds of cream swirling forever in your coffee.\\n\\n\\n'The wonderful thing about this study is that we discovered that we could understand this fundamental phenomenon through what is almost simple geometry,' Nandkishore said.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nThe team's findings could influence a lot more than just quantum computers.\\n\\n\\nNandkishore explained that almost everything in the universe, from cups of coffee to vast oceans, tends to move toward what scientists call 'thermal equilibrium.' If you drop an ice cube into your mug, for example, heat from your coffee will melt the ice, eventually forming a liquid with a uniform temperature.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nHis new findings, however, join a growing body of research that suggests that some small organizations of matter can resist that equilibrium\\u2014seemingly breaking some of the most immutable laws of the universe.\\n\\n\\n'We're not going to have to redo our math for ice and water,' Nandkishore said. 'The field of mathematics that we call statistical physics is incredibly successful for describing things we encounter in everyday life. But there are settings where maybe it doesn't apply.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"In the lead up to the 2024 presidential race, Republican and Democratic voters in Colorado remain deeply divided in how much they trust the integrity of national elections.\\n\\nThat's one of the top takeaways from a new survey by researchers at the American Politics Research Lab (APRL) at CU Boulder and the polling company YouGov. The team has published its Colorado Political Climate Survey annually since 2017\\u2014an attempt to track how voters in Colorado are navigating hot-button issues like election integrity, abortion and more.\\n\\nIn this year's survey, released online Jan. 29, the team reports that 75% of Democrats but only 46% of independents and 41% of Republicans agreed that 'elections across the country will be conducted fairly and accurately.' Colorado voters, however, are much more optimistic about elections in their own state. A slim majority, or 54%, of Republican voters expressed optimism that statewide elections will be fair and accurate.\\n\\n'That's troubling,' said Anand Sokhey, director of the APRL and co-author of the new survey. 'We've been seeing that partisan split for a while now, and it reflects messaging from Donald Trump and his surrogates questioning the results of the 2020 election.'\\n\\nTo carry out the survey, the online survey vendor YouGov gathered responses from 800 Coloradans across the state in December 2023. They included 229 self-identified Republicans, 263 Democrats and 263 independents (with some respondents identifying themselves as 'other'). The survey is weighted to reflect the general population of Colorado and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.23%.\\n\\nBy the numbers From a CU Boulder and YouGov survey of 800 Colorado voters living across the state in Denver 2023. Job approval ratings: President Joe Biden: 42% approve, 50% disapprove\\n\\nGov. Jared Polis: 49% approve, 37% disapprove\\n\\nSen. John Hickenlooper: 43% approve, 36% disapprove\\n\\nSen. Michael Bennet: 41% approve, 29% disapprove\\n\\nRep. Lauren Boebert: 29% approve, 46% disapprove Issues: Do you favor or oppose the movement known as 'Black Lives Matter'? Favor: 50%\\n\\nOppose: 38%\\n\\nNot sure: 12% How much do you favor or oppose the federal government making it more difficult for individuals to purchase a gun? Favor: 56%\\n\\nOppose: 36%\\n\\nNot sure: 7% How concerned are you personally about climate change? 'Very concerned' or 'concerned': 51%\\n\\n'Somewhat concerned': 19%\\n\\n'Not very concerned' or 'not at all concerned': 30% How much do you approve of the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade? Favor: 33%\\n\\nOppose: 51%\\n\\nNot sure: 16%\\n\\nThe researchers discovered that Colorado seems to be continuing its blue-ward shift of the last decade or so. In the survey, voters favored incumbent President Joe Biden in a hypothetical race against former President Donald Trump by 47% to 40%.\\n\\nOne thing voters of all affiliations could agree on: Colorado is too expensive. Nearly 80% of survey respondents reported that they were 'concerned' or 'very concerned' about the cost of living in the state.\\n\\n'Our goal was to take the pulse of the state as we're entering this election period,' Sokhey said. 'In some ways, you'll see a Colorado that reflects the rest of the country, but you'll also see how the state is approaching some issues in a way that's unique.'\\n\\nThe economy, stupid\\n\\nHe added that one factor may wind up having an outsized role in shaping the results of the upcoming elections: our pocketbooks.\\n\\nAnd voters are leagues apart in how they perceive the economy. Nearly two-thirds of Republicans and independents rated the state of the nation's economy as 'fair' or 'poor,' according to the survey. Only on-third of Democrats, in contrast, expressed similar pessimistic views about the economy.\\n\\nSokhey suspects these divides come down to partisan voters hearing very different messages about the economy from the media they consume.\\n\\n'You see that, consistently, Republicans and Democrats are in completely different economic worlds in terms their perceptions,' he said.\\n\\nAn eye on Colorado\\n\\nSokhey noted that, in 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade may have motivated left-leaning voters to turn out for that year's midterm elections. Heading into the 2024 elections, abortion could continue to be a major force in politics.\\n\\nAccording to the survey, 51% of voters in Colorado opposed the court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health, while 33% approved of it. Notable, Sokhey said, independents seemed to join Democrats in their disapproval\\u2014only 24% reported that they approved of overturning Roe v. Wade.\\n\\n'We're seeing a lot of data in Colorado and nationally that this could be a vulnerable issue for Republicans,' he said.\\n\\nOn the local side, survey respondents also weighed on the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights (TABOR). Voters approved this amendment to Colorado's constitution, which limits how the state can raise or spend taxpayer dollars, in 1992. They seemed to still be in favor today, with 54% of respondents expressing their approval.\\n\\nSome voters, however, may be confused by TABOR impacts and by language in other ballot measures, Sokhey said.\\n\\nLast year, voters rejected Proposition HH, a measure to rejigger the state's property taxes, by solid margins. According to the new survey, more than two-thirds of voters said they found the language in that proposition confusing.\\n\\n'We see issues around TABOR pop up every few years, and these are complicated and confusing things,' Sokhey said. 'Indeed, people were confused about HH, and they assumed that their friends and families were, too.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"When voters cast their ballots in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, many were driven by their concern for climate change, according to new research out of CU Boulder's Center for Environmental Futures (C-SEF). The new report determined that views on climate change played a significant role in whom people voted for, concluding that the climate issue very likely cost Republicans the 2020 election, all else equal.\\u00a0\\n'This is obviously information that politicians and advocates across the political spectrum will want to know, heading into the 2024 election cycle,' said Matthew Burgess, CIRES Fellow and C-SEF director. 'How to reduce political polarization of climate change is one of the questions our research group is most interested in currently, and this provides some insight.'\\nIn their new assessment,\\u00a0\\npublished today\\n, Burgess and his co-authors, two C-SEF graduate students and researchers from Vanderbilt University and the University of California Santa Barbara, sought to understand the importance of climate change as a voter issue in the two most recent presidential elections. The team used data from the nonpartisan\\u00a0\\nVoter Study Group\\n, to analyze how issue opinions and demographics affected the 2016 and 2020 elections.\\u00a0\\nThe research team used several techniques to assess how climate change opinion shaped voters' choices: logistic regression, a machine learning model, and a simulation of the Electoral College in which they could turn the role of climate change on or off. Their conclusion: Republicans could have gained at least a 3-percent swing in the popular vote, which almost certainly would have been enough to have taken the White House in 2020.\\nThe team found personal views on climate change were one of the strongest predictors of voting behavior in 2020, especially among independents. Not surprisingly, they found the majority of Democrats and independents are worried about climate change. And, many younger and moderate Republicans also see climate change as an important issue\\u2014one-quarter of Republicans who think climate change is 'very important' voted for President Biden in 2020.\\u00a0\\nSuch widespread concern about climate change is currently a clear upper hand for the Democratic party. The party holds a 26-point advantage over Republicans on the issue, a lead larger than any other opposing topic between the two parties, in\\u00a0\\na recent poll\\n. Voters from a broad range of political persuasions seem to see Democrats as more capable of finding solutions and instating policies to address problems created by climate change, even if not every Democratic climate change policy is necessarily popular. \\u00a0\\nWhile the issue of climate change strongly predicts whom people voted for in 2020, overall, it is not the number-one concern among voters.\\u00a0\\nLess than 5 percent\\u00a0\\nof adults rank climate change as the single most important issue. More pressing issues include those that affect people's daily lives, like the economy, healthcare, education, and crime.\\u00a0\\nIf climate change isn't voters' top issue, why is it such a strong predictor?\\n'One reason might be that most people see the evidence for climate change as so strong that, if a candidate were to deny or minimize that issue, they might trust that candidate less on other issues,' Burgess said. 'Another reason might be that voters are beginning to see a connection between climate change and the kitchen table issues they care about more, like the economy, security, and health. But we can't say for sure, and this is a key question for future research.'\\nAs the country prepares for the next election, the odds are good that climate change will influence whom they vote for.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Sidney D'Mello is a professor in CU Boulder's Institute of Cognitive Science and Department of Computer Science. He is also director of the National Science Foundation AI Institute for Student-AI Teaming, which aims to develop artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to facilitate social and collaborative learning experiences for all students.\\n\\nCan you talk about your research with AI and education?\\n\\nThere are five flagship NSF research institutes that focus on supporting learning with AI, and we were the first one. Schools right now haven't changed in a hundred years \\u2014 they're focused on efficiency as an outcome. The use of AI in education has been to keep that vision of efficiency going where students individually work with computer programs powered by AI.\\n\\nThe vision I want for classrooms is a place where students are working together, being loud, and it's a noisy, rambunctious environment where they're challenging ideas, and they're building social relationships. This vision is centered around a different perspective of learning, which is that learning is authentic to students' interests and identities and so on. A key question we ask is how best to integrate AI within that vision.\\n\\nHow could your vision be implemented?\\n\\nThis is a vision that's been articulated forever in the learning sciences, but it is difficult for teachers to implement because they can't be listening in on several student groups at once. Some conversations may go off track, or perhaps some conversations are amazing, but the teacher is unaware of the discussion happening. So the question is, how can AI help support this?\\n\\nOur idea is thinking of AI as this social collaborative partner immersed in these small groups to help them along. The AI is actually interacting with small groups, listening in on the conversations, analyzing nonverbal behaviors like pointing, and then figuring out how to facilitate those small-group conversations, but always by coordinating with the teacher. The teacher remains the centerpiece here. The AI is providing decision support around the teacher to help them orchestrate their classroom as they see best.\\n\\nHow are students responding to your research?\\n\\nWe know that with AI comes great responsibility. We didn't want to build anything without first working with the students themselves.\\n\\nWe know that with AI comes great responsibility. We didn't want to build anything without first working with the students themselves. We organized workshops with them to be transparent, acquire their trust and have their voices heard. However, we soon realized that it was challenging for youth to imagine what good collaboration could look like beyond what they had experienced in school.\\n\\nSo we took a group of students to this cooperative house in Berkeley, Colorado, where they learned how house members had to live together and collaborate outside of schooling. They were introduced to the idea of community agreements, which are mutually agreed upon norms of behavior that the house members themselves co-negotiate and use to hold each other account-able. The youth wondered if an AI could help them to generate and maintain such agreements and developed a design sketch to embody their ideas.\\n\\nWhat happened as a result?\\n\\nThis led to one of our AI technologies called the Community Builder (CoBi). With the help of the teacher, students work in small groups to input their examples of agreements into the CoBi interface. As students engage in collaborative learning, CoBi analyzes student discourse for evidence, or 'noticings,' of these agreement categories. The results are visualized by way of a growing tree animation that everyone can see, where the noticings are shown as flowers that bloom. Teachers and students use these visualizations to reflect and make sense about their adherence to their agreements.\\n\\nNow this is where privacy becomes really important. By working with students and getting their sense of comfort, we learned they are terrified of any of their individual talk being known to the teacher. So we do not give the teacher any information on who's speaking and saying what. We don't even say which student group. It's all aggregated in this class-level interface, which is the tree.\\n\\nAre students interacting with the AI interface?\\n\\nWe actually show them what the CoBi is doing, and then the idea is they can correct it if they see something off with its predictions.That gives us good data,and the students can help it improve itself. But more importantly, they can have a conversation about why it's doing what it's doing. Because, remember, we also want to teach youth how to learn and collaborate. And so they can have a conversation like, \\u2018Hey, CoBi, we thought this was an example of being respectful, but you missed it.'\\n\\nWhat concerns do you have about ChatGPT right now?\\n\\nI don't think we should ban these tools, as that never works. But there's a lot of stuff that still needs to be addressed with these AI programs still. For example, when I'm talking, I'm gesturing and pointing. So I'm making meaning in that context. ChatGPT and all of those other programs are good for their language piece, but they are not grounded in the real world. That's why we are working with foundational AI to integrate semantics of speech with gesture, gaze and social cues to make an understanding from multimodal, multi-party discourse.\\n\\nHow can teachers quickly be trained in AI?\\n\\nRight now a phrase that's used a lot is 'responsible AI'.\\n\\nYou can get teachers caught up in AI, and we're developing curricula for AI literacy for this very purpose. But it's really a more foundational thing \\u2014 how can we change learning? How do you design a curriculum that does 21st-century skills, collaboration, critical thinking, inquiry, disciplinary knowledge, experimentation, investigation and developing character at the same time?\\n\\nYou've talked a lot about ethical and equitable AI. What does that mean? Right now a phrase that's used a lot is 'responsible AI'. It's not asking what AI can do, it's asking what I should do, basically. We have a framework of responsible innovation that we implement in everything we do from the start, and it begins with ourselves \\u2014 our values, our processes and our commitment to our students and teachers.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Are you wondering how to rebuild a car engine, make lasagna, apply eyeliner or build a castle in Minecraft? Millions of Americans get their answers from 'influencers' on social media. And now a growing crowd of 'finfluencers' \\u2014 a portmanteau of the phrase 'financial influencers' \\u2014 are vying to become your investing gurus.\\n\\nSearch 'investing' or a related term on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube or any other major social media platform, and you'll get thousands of posts from a dizzying array of creators. You'll see videos of investors flaunting wads of cash, driving Lamborghinis or flashing screenshots purportedly showing big profits from options trading, cryptocurrencies or 'passive income' investing strategies. You'll also seeinvesting basicsdemonstrated with card tricks, comedy skits or dance celebrations. There are posts from finance professionals and amateur investors, twentysomethings and sixtysomethings, and members of all types of affinity groups. And, of course, you'll also find posts from media outlets like Kiplinger.\\n\\nThe most popular investing social media mavens have amassed millions of followers and are earning millions of dollars from advertisements, sponsorships, book sales, and membership and consulting fees. Many are succeeding for good reason: They provide sound advice in entertaining ways.\\n\\nFor Denise Berkhalter, a 51-year-old single mother of two who works at a nonprofit, the fun, high-energy videos by former Wall Street trader Vivian Tu (whose 'Your Rich BFF' TikTok account has 2.5 million followers) provided encouragement for her to maximize her employer's retirement plan match and maintain both a regular and a Roth IRA. Berkhalter plows much of the money into the kinds of broad index funds that Tu recommends. 'She's hilarious,' says Berkhalter. 'She's relatable. She takes the time to break things down into understandable bite sizes. And she's willing to talk about her own mistakes, which is helpful because you realize you don't have to be perfect.'\\n\\nFormer Wall Street trader Vivian Tu's TikTok account, 'Your Rich BFF,' has 2.5M followers.\\n\\nBut some influencers promote strategies that are inappropriate for many, if not most, investors. Worse: Social media platforms are also rife with scamsters. Federal regulations require influencers to clearly label any posts for which they are being paid and bar misleading statements or frauds, such as 'pump-and-dump' schemes in which influencers secretly sell shares in stocks they are hyping to their followers. And the government has pursued some high-profile influencers.\\n\\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has extracted millions of dollars collectively from celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan to settle charges that they improperly failed to disclose they were being paid to promote cryptocurrencies on their social media feeds on Instagram and Twitter (now known as X). The SEC has also charged several popular finfluencers with running pump-and-dump schemes. And, undoubtedly, a lot escapes scrutiny. So many people are now making investment-related content that 'it is literally not possible' for budget-constrained federal regulators to monitor and police all of it on all social media platforms, says Ankush Khardori, a former federal prosecutor who specialized in financial crimes. Even if you don't take investing advice from social media stars, you should be aware of the landscape because the odds are that your friends and relatives do.\\n\\nA study by Finra, the self-regulatory organization for brokers, found that 60% of investors younger than 35 get investing information from social media. Videos with the hashtag #investing have garnered an astonishing 16 billion views on TikTok since its 2016 launch, for example. What's more, social media investing frenzies can significantly impact the values of stocks in your portfolio (recall the mayhem in GameStop and other 'meme' stocks engineered by Reddit users in 2021).\\n\\nTo help you navigate this new frontier for financial advice, we dived into the world of finfluencers, starting with FinCon 2023, the annual confab for personal finance content creators. It's a vast universe. But here, we highlight some of the better-known social media accounts, along with a few not-so-famous selections. We've included a breakdown of finfluencers' financial incentives that can help you suss out any potential hidden agendas or biases. We've also assembled a list of red flags from experts to help you stay safe online.\\n\\nThe evolution of finfluence\\n\\nThe Oxford English Dictionary defines an influencer as 'a person who has become well-known through use of the internet and social media, and uses celebrity to endorse products \\u2026 often for payment.' The word finfluencer may be a new coinage, but it just describes the latest evolution of long-standing marketing and outreach efforts by financial advisers and personal finance media professionals. After all, Vanguard founder Jack Bogle amplified his index fund investing message by publishing books. Ric Edelman attracted clients to his financial planning firm by hosting a finance-focused radio show. Jim Cramer left his hedge fund to host the Mad Money television show and encourage viewers to buy his investing books and pay the membership fee for his investing club.\\n\\nIt's not surprising that many professional financial advisers are trying to use social media to recruit new clients. A few have developed large fan bases. Brad Klontz, a Hawaii-based certified financial planner and author of books on the psychology of money, has nearly 1 million TikTok followers. Among his most popular videos is one showing him wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses, walking the streets of Boulder, Colorado, and talking into a microphone about how 'you'll be poor forever if you do these three things' (one of which is day-trading). Other social media gurus who still call investment advising their day job include Brian Preston and Bo Hanson, certified financial planners at Abound Wealth Management in Franklin, Tennessee. They host 'The Money Guy Show,' which has amassed more than 78 million views cumulatively in its 12 years on YouTube. The episodes generally run from 15 minutes to an hour and feature the two sitting at desks, taking calls, conducting interviews and discussing topics such as allocations to international stocks, as well as broader personal finance issues such as the outlook for real estate and reactions to Dave Ramsey's advice.\\n\\nJennifer Lammer, a registered investment adviser in Scarsdale, New York, posts 10- to 20-minute detailed looks at fixed-income investments such as bonds and CDs in her 'Diamond NestEgg' YouTube channel, launched in mid-2020. Her posts, such as 'The 8 safest banks,' have collectively received more than 12 million views.\\n\\nThe largest group of finfluencers today is made up of personalities who offer broad personal finance advice. Investing typically makes up only a fraction of their offerings and tends to be aimed at beginners. Some of the most popular of these are former finance professionals. Vivian Tu, who posts as 'Your Rich BFF,' spent two years as a trader at J.P. Morgan before starting to post short financial advice videos on TikTok during the COVID lockdowns. Her goal, she says, is to 'make finance fun-ance.' In a recent post that has nearly 2 million views, she explains how regular investors can copy a tax move used by pop star Drake to seed his kid's Roth IRA. Drake hired his son to produce album art, then funneled his earnings into a custodial Roth IRA for the child. Tu suggested noncelebrity parents can hire their kids to work in a family business and use that income to invest in a custodial Roth IRA, where it can grow tax-free. (Or they could invest earnings from, say, babysitting, cutting grass or other odd jobs.) Tu recommends S&P 500 index funds.\\n\\nHumphrey Yang, who spent a year as a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch, has 3.3 million TikTok followers and 1.2 million YouTube subscribers who eat up his short videos on everything from the economics of buying an electric bike to the impossibility of timing the stock market. In one he examines what he considers the 'four worst investments' \\u2014 low-paying savings accounts, whole life insurance, mutual funds that charge sales fees, and triple-leveraged exchange-traded funds, which are funds that borrow against their holdings so their prices move three times as much as the index they track. YouTube says that collectively, Yang's 571 videos have been viewed more than 271 million times.\\n\\nMarko Zlatic studied finance in college and worked as a car salesman, and then as a credit analyst at a bank. In late 2017, he started posting YouTube videos in which he explained a specific aspect of personal finance by writing on a whiteboard with a marker while throwing in a few jokes to keep things light. Some of his early videos, such as one on 'How car dealers rip you off,' went viral. By 2019, Zlatic's 'WhiteBoard Finance' channel was earning enough that he could quit his job. His library includes investing-oriented posts, such as one explaining how he built a SEP IRA, with some input from viewers. He calculates the IRA, invested in low-cost ETFs from Vanguard and others, will pay an income of $1,000 a month in retirement. Zlatic's library, of about 300 videos, has collected more than 61 million views.\\n\\nSome of the most popular finfluencers come from outside the financial world. Many say they were motivated to start posting because they overcame financial struggles themselves and wanted to share hope and strategies with those facing similar challenges.\\n\\nAndrei Jikh's parents were Cirque du Soleil acrobats who struggled with debt. Jikh started his career as a magician but also studied investing on his own. He built a $200,000 nest egg, and in 2019 he started posting videos about what he learned, spicing some of them up with magic tricks. Along with bullish posts about cryptocurrencies, Jikh shares his dividend-investing strategy, which focuses on index funds and Dividend Aristocrats such as Realty Income. (Aristocrats are stocks with at least a 25-year history of raising dividends; Realty Income is a member of the Kiplinger Dividend 15, the list of our favorite dividend payers.) Jikh's videos have more than 283 million views.\\n\\nAnother major group of finfluencers consists of analysts using the new media platforms to launch what are, essentially, modern investing newsletters. Robert Ross was a stock analyst for the newsletter firm Mauldin Economics in 2019 when he started experimenting with short investing videos on what was then a relatively new social media platform, TikTok. The niche was so new that he was able to snag one of the cleverest user names: Tik.stocks. Many of his stock-analysis videos and meme-laced takes on hedge funds' holdings went viral. A skit warning against buying stock with margin loans has garnered more than 2 million views. Within 15 months, Ross was earning enough from sponsorships and subscriptions to quit his job. He still delivers some tips on his free account. But today, nearly 800 of his followers are paying at least $19.99 a month to see Ross' personal portfolio and investments, grossing him about $14,000 monthly.\\n\\n'This is the next natural iteration of an industry that has been around for 100 years \\u2014 the newsletter. It's just a video version,' he says.\\n\\nThe ease of posting online has enabled self-taught analysts to reach large audiences as well. In late 2020, Alex Divinsky, who majored in electrical engineering and worked as a rocket analyst and media strategist, started posting his analyses of tech stocks on his YouTube channel 'Ticker Symbol: YOU.' His first 11 videos got only a few hundred views each. His 12th got more than 40,000 and put Divinsky on many investors' radar. In it, he explained why he thought Tesla's autonomous driving software, trained on billions of miles' worth of driving data from its cars, would eventually translate into massive profit for the company. After eight months of weekly posts, Divinsky's channel became so popular he was on track to earn a six-figure annual income from ads and sponsorships. His 10- to 30-minute posts typically explore a company held by one of the tech-oriented funds managed by ARK Investments. In a recent post, Divinsky spliced in slides, video clips and documents from company presentations and other sources to explain why he thinks Nvidia will continue to dominate the market for chips used in the booming artificial intelligence sector. Overall, Divinsky has amassed more than 27 million views.\\n\\nVivian Tu, 'Your Rich BFF' (Image credit: Taylor Hill/Getty Images)\\n\\nLow barriers to entry can lead to scams\\n\\nThe low barriers to entry have also been exploited by scamsters plying some of Wall Street's oldest scams. For example, a group of day traders associated with a company called Atlas Trading each built up six-figure fan bases on platforms such as Twitter, YouTube and the gaming chat platform Discord by claiming expertise in 'penny stocks,' which are the stocks of small companies with share prices below $5. The traders, who often posted pictures of their Lamborghinis and luxury watches, told their followers they were sharing their insights for free 'to help millions of traders.'\\n\\nBut the SEC says it has recordings of group members conspiring to hype certain stocks so that they can quietly sell at a profit. The SEC alleges the group made more than $100 million from 2020 through their 2022 indictment by 'pumping and dumping.' In one recording cited by the SEC, Daniel Knight, a cohost of a popular penny stock podcast who had 171,000 Twitter followers under the handle @DipDeity, allegedly said, 'We're robbing f***ing idiots of their money\\u2026. It's market manipulation.' Knight pleaded guilty to securities fraud in March 2023. His co-defendants are scheduled for trial in early 2024.\\n\\nFinfluencers find their niche\\n\\nMany finfluencers tailor personal finance and investing advice to specific groups. Several aim their advice at women, for example.\\n\\nTori Dunlap's 'her first 100k' TikTok account features short videos encouraging women to improve their earnings and wealth \\u2014 or, as she puts it: 'Fight the patriarchy. Get rich.' Dunlap has amassed 2.4 million followers since 2020. Her podcast, 'Financial Feminist,' features interviews and discussions ofinvesting basics as well as topics such as 'negotiating like a woman' and 'overcoming financial anxiety.'

Yanely Espinal, the daughter of Hispanic immigrants, started posting YouTube videos as 'MissBeHelpful' after being inspired by a Suze Orman book to cut her expenses to free up cash from her educator's salary to pay off $20,000 in credit card debt and build her savings. Espinal appreciated Orman's discussion of finances for women but couldn't find anyone addressing many of the issues faced in her community. For example, she said, 'No one was talking about remittances [sending money to family in other countries] as part of the budget.' Espinal's videos have more than 4.4 million views, and last May she published a book entitled Mind Your Money. It includes a chapter about investing challenges faced by immigrants and people of color, such as language barriers that can make financial dealings more confusing.\\n\\n'When your life has been transformed, you don't want to hold it in.

      "            \"summary\": \"BIG SUR \\u2014 The world-famous Esalen Institute hasn't seen this much controversy since a psychic was hired in 1979 to contact extraterrestrials for advice on reorganizing management. Now, as Esalen marks its 50th anniversary, veterans of the New Age retreat center best known for massages, self-awareness and naked hot-tubbing say a new crisis has emerged: a corporate philosophy bent on making money and turning the institute into a boutique-style spa.\\n\\n'Esalen now emulates the worst of corporate America,' one employee posted on esaleaks.org, a website modeled on WikiLeaks that gives voice to the Esalen community of workers and workshop leaders that is suddenly feeling more fear and intimidation than peace and love.\\n\\n'We've lost sight of what this place was founded for,' said Bill Herr, who has been connected with Esalen for two decades and is now the director of its art center.\\n\\nThe controversy comes at a time when the institute is striving to maintain its identity, relevance and bottom line \\u2014 long after its pioneering achievements have gone mainstream: yoga classes at the YMCA, massages at the mall, organic food at Walmart.\\n\\nTensions reached a boiling point last month when three beloved midlevel managers were abruptly laid off as part of a 'restructuring.' The widow of one of the two co-founders as well as an Esalen board member resigned in protest. A son of one founder and a nephew of another worry about Esalen's legacy. And every day at 1 p.m., a defiant group \\u2014 sometimes as many as 70 people \\u2014 gather in a silent 'circle of honor' to mourn the loss of the laid-off co-workers.\\n\\n'It's been a bloodbath in ways as the old school has met the new,' said David Schiffman, 69, who has led 'vision quests' and workshops at Esalen for 43 years. He recently decided to stop singing and drumming at the 'spirit calling and purification' ceremonies on a deck overlooking the Pacific Ocean.\\n\\n'I didn't want to be fiddling while Rome burned,' Schiffman said. 'I couldn't imagine playing music in a place where people were having the music squeezed out of them.'\\n\\nFounded by Michael Murphy and Dick Price in 1962, Esalen quickly became a symbol of California's hippie counterculture, attracting the music and pop psychology icons of the day \\u2014 from Bob Dylan and Joan Baez to Timothy Leary, Fritz Perls and Abraham Maslow, whose 'hierarchy of needs' became required college reading.\\n\\nIn the 1970s, Murphy's 'Golf in the Kingdom' became a best-seller. And in the '80s, Esalen became known for 'hot tub diplomacy' when it tried to play a role in easing Cold War tensions by hosting Soviet diplomats, including then-Moscow Mayor Boris Yeltsin, on tours of America and meetings with their U.S. counterparts.\\n\\n'In its day, Esalen was the TED Talks and Burning Man all rolled into one,' said David Price, general manager from 1995 to 2003 and son of co-founder Dick Price, who died when he was crushed by a Big Sur boulder in 1985. 'I just don't see it as having that level of impact right now. To me, it's a shame.'\\n\\nAnd while the current strife 'looks like a management vs. labor kind of dispute,' said the art center's Herr, 'what's really going on is a kind of cultural assault.'\\n\\nBut Esalen President Gordon Wheeler and board member Bill James say Esalen remains a vibrant place where for the past eight years \\u2014 many of those recessionary years \\u2014 it has welcomed record numbers of guests to sex and marriage sessions, organic farming seminars, human potential workshops and leadership conferences.\\n\\nStill, Wheeler said, 'it is true we have to have more emphasis on accountability and job effectiveness than we used to. We're a nonprofit. We do need to break even. The pressures for that are greater than they used to be, for sure.'\\n\\nThe controversy has been made all the more painful and intense, he said, by the isolation of the institute 45 miles down the rocky coastline from Monterey \\u2014 and the fact that about 100 employees live on the property and feel as close as family. Many participate in the 'work/study' program, living on the property, doing housekeeping or working in the garden and kitchen, as well as joining groups of stocking-feet workshop guests in meditation and other self-help seminars.\\n\\nThe recent changes have been especially difficult for those who go back decades. Like most companies, James said, Esalen employees now must log their hours and explain overtime \\u2014 which to old-timers 'smacks of not being trusted.' And after a recent incident in which a busy, exasperated kitchen employee refused to make a birthday cake for a guest, James said, employees were encouraged to 'smile and nod' at guests as they pass them along the dirt pathways.\\n\\n'You would have thought we ordered them to wear a uniform,' James said. 'Something like this is a revolution to them.'\\n\\nThe nonprofit corporation that owns Esalen has healthy reserves and is embarking on an ambitious long-term plan to renovate nearly every yurt, cottage and barn on the property. But Esalen officials say they have no intention of turning the place into a luxury resort like Post Ranch and Ventana just up Highway 1.\\n\\n'To become a high-end spa would be too dull for us,' Wheeler said. 'We'd like to serve our guests a little better. But that's it.'\\n\\nWhile Esalen may have a five-star view, recent upgrades to some guest units raised them closer to Holiday Inn status, James said.\\n\\nHe and Wheeler say they want to keep the institute focused on the 'cutting edge' of thought, on personal and social transformations and helping mold leaders through 'conscious business' seminars. Earlier this month, executives from Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Nordstrom and IDEO gathered for one of them.\\n\\nThe irony isn't lost on Esalen managers, who know they sometimes appear to have missed some of their own workshops \\u2014 'Enlightened Leadership in Challenging Times,' for instance.\\n\\n'We're trying to do the best we can, and we don't always get it right,' Wheeler said. 'Could we have handled it better? I think we could have, yes.'\\n\\nThe institute has certainly gone through tough times before. In 1998, El Ni\\u00f1o storms destroyed the legendary open-air mineral baths fed by hot springs jetting out of the cliffs. Cost overruns to rebuild the bathhouse and tubs plunged the institute deeply into debt and forced managers to rethink operations. More people with more business backgrounds and fewer with psychology credentials were invited to join the board. And conflicts with staff became more common as more basic business practices were implemented.\\n\\nThe Esaleaks website was created a year before the recent layoffs as an anonymous forum for employees to air their gripes. Posted documents, from staff salaries to tax returns, have been uploaded to the site.\\n\\nOn the website, the writers sardonically refer to themselves as 'The Nine,' a reference to the so-called nine extraterrestrials from the star Sirius that British psychic Jenny O'Connor said she 'channeled' to help her decide how to shake-up management in the late 1970s. At the time, some in the community referred to 'The Nine' as 'extraterrestrial hatchet men.' O'Connor was hired by Dick Price.\\n\\n'I think he may have used her to enact things he wanted to do anyway,' said his son David, who lives in Poland but returns to Esalen every year. 'There was a level of absurdity to the whole thing.'\\n\\nThe current management crisis, however, seems to cut deeper. Several recent meetings and letters back and forth have so far failed to ease the tensions.\\n\\n'The realities that sober you up, that make you feel the weight of things, the responsibility to be serious, not dreamy or childish, have come home to roost,' Schiffman said. 'The struggle has been to keep the soul of Esalen intact.'\\n\\nContact Julia Prodis Sulek at 408-278-3409.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"As he walks around his Oakland office near I-880, environmental advocate Brian Beveridge sees obvious issues: diesel exhaust and piles of trash. But he has deeper concerns \\u2014 literally.\\n\\n\\nBeveridge, co-founder of West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project, is worried about solvents and other chemicals in the soil, a legacy of spills from polluting industries that long operated in West Oakland. If a severe storm rolls in, bringing surging seas and heavy rain, the dormant contamination could be brought back to the surface, drowning the area in a toxic stew.\\n\\n\\n'We operate with a kind of false sense of security because we've been living in a drought for 15 years,' Beveridge said. 'Within three months, we could have a flooded neighborhood, emergency crews trying to clear out storm drains, toxic water going into the bay.'\\n\\n\\nPatrick Barnard explains in Jan. 2020 how the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS) integrates information from the Hazard Exposure and Reporting Analytics (HERA) mapper to understand the social and economic consequences of different flooding scenarios. (Courtesy of USGS/ Coastal Storm Modeling System)\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nThat threat will worsen with a rise in the sea level driven by climate change. On a glossy map propped up against the whiteboard in his office, Beveridge points at West Oakland and Alameda and imagines both inundated with water. The threat of sea-level rise is one of the hazards tracked by the Coastal Storm Modeling System (CoSMoS), which predicts the myriad effects that coastal storms and shoreline change could bring.\\n\\n\\nThe modeling system, developed by a team led by Patrick Barnard and Li Erikson of the U.S. Geological Survey's Pacific Coastal and Marine  Center in Santa Cruz, combines data from weather services, measurements from monitored sites and detailed data on the shape of the coast and seabed. It also factors in the effects of future sea-level rise and increasing storm intensity to show how those will increase with climate change. The information provides a crucial resource for environmental advocates and city officials planning for the effects of climate change.\\n\\n\\nOfficials in San Mateo County, for instance, turn to the modeling system before purchasing any land parcels, ensuring that they understand risks posed by rising groundwater, erosion and coastal flooding.\\n \\n'These tools are really, really important for us,' said Isabel Pares Ramos, the county's senior sustainability specialist.\\n\\n\\nIn the office of Andy O'Neill, an oceanographer and storm modeler, the desk space is taken up by widescreen monitors that she clicks between as she talks. Displayed across them are lines of computer code, a presentation on the modeling system, and maps zoomed in on various Bay Area cities.\\n \\nA blue sphere floats in the corner of a presentation, showing wind and water movement for the globe. 'You can't go straight from global changes to local impacts without a couple steps,' said O'Neill as she explained how CoSMoS incorporates data from global climate models into local predictions of storm impacts.\\n\\n\\nKnowing where storms will hit hardest is useful, but planners also need to understand what that means for residents and infrastructure.\\n\\n\\n'Just showing hazard maps doesn't really mean a lot to people, but when there are dollars and lives that are tied in, that opens up the discussion with governments,' said Barnard of USGS, which also developed the Hazard Exposure Reporting Analytics tool to show the human and economic effects of storm-impact projections.\\n\\n\\nNate Wood, one of its developers, provided a demonstration on a Zoom call from his office in Portland, Oregon. With a mouse click, projected sea levels that incorporate data on storm surges climbed up to 10 feet, bathing cities in the Bay Area in azure.\\n\\n\\nFurther clicks set the map awash with new blocks of color showing how many residents, homes, employees and buildings might end up underwater given potential storm surges and predicted sea level rise.\\n\\n\\n'It's setting the scene for more relevant conversations about what people truly value,' Wood said. 'And if my data can be part of that conversation, then I've done my job.'\\n\\n\\nOne of the major Bay Area assets that's already being affected by coastal storms is the San Francisco Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant. The El Ni\\u00f1o winter of 2009 and 2010 brought storms that caused severe erosion and destroyed parts of the Great Highway, which separates the southern end of Ocean Beach from the plant. The city took drastic measures, protecting the plant with a 425-foot-long embankment of boulders known as riprap.\\n\\n\\nIf the plant were to fail, it would cause sewage to spill straight into the sea, destroying coastal water quality. But in 2011, the California Coastal Commission denied permits to add additional armoring.\\n\\n\\n'The wastewater treatment plant is in the way of where the coast wants to be,' said Dan Hoover, also with the USGS in Santa Cruz. 'So there's really no way you can protect it in the long term.'\\n\\n\\nFor many people living in parts of the Bay Area most threatened by sea level rise and storm surges, moving isn't an option, given the costs of relocation.\\n\\n\\n'Our council strategy so far has been very clear to us: that we should be doing everything possible to protect the coastal shoreline, to protect those communities and to keep people rooted within the community,' said Daniel Hamilton, sustainability and resilience director for the city of Oakland.\\n\\n\\nThe road is closed on 7th Street at Frontage Road after flooding in West Oakland, Calif., on Thursday, Feb. 14, 2019. (Jane Tyska/Bay Area  Group)\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nIn West Oakland, communities asked for a central location to gather during emergencies. This year, Oakland partnered with the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project and other grassroots organizations to fund a resilience hub at 18th and Adeline streets. This includes the DeFremery Recreation Center, the West Oakland Senior Center and West Oakland Branch Library. If flooding were to occur, residents would be able to access resources such as food and electricity to charge their devices.\\n\\n\\nOakland is also protecting its waterfront by putting down riprap mixed with eelgrass and native plants to create floodable zones that could prevent water from reaching neighborhoods such as West Oakland.\\n\\n\\nWorking out how best to protect local communities from the ravages of storms and sea level rise depends crucially on tools developed by the USGS and local research organizations, including the San Francisco Estuary Institute, Hamilton said.\\n\\n\\nCities 'don't have the ability to do that science independently,' he said.\",\n",

The same answer applies to Arizona's loss at Washington State two weeks ago and Arizona's loss at Stanford two weeks before that.\\n\\n\\nWinning on the road is hard, folks.\\n\\n\\nAt the midpoint of the Pac-12 season, road teams have a 16-40 record in conference play \\u2014 a winning percentage of just 28.6.\\n\\n\\nEach game follows a different course. Perhaps poor shooting by the visitors is the cause. Or officiating that leans toward the home team. Or a singular performance akin to what we saw last week in Corvallis from OSU guard Jordan Pope.\\n\\n\\nIt all adds up to the same conclusion. And in the Pac-12, winning on the road this season is substantially more difficult than in recent years.\\n\\n\\nWe avoided pre-COVID data, and we skipped the 2020-21 season because of the obvious disruption caused by the pandemic.\\n \\nBut it's worth noting that road teams won 42.5 percent of conference games (raw record: 51-69) during the 2021-22 season, a high level of success perhaps attributable to the lingering impact of COVID on attendance. (Home games carried a neutral-court vibe.)\\n\\n\\nThe numbers dropped in the 2022-23 season, which was normal in every regard: Road teams were just 44-76, a winning percentage of 36.7.\\n \\nIf the current pace (28.6 percent) holds through the final five weeks of conference play, the visitors will finish this season with a 34-86 record.\\n\\n\\nAnd that pace could be worse. Five of the 16 road wins thus far have come by three points or less. Had a few bounces gone for the hosts instead of the visitors, the win rate for road teams would be on the low side of 25 percent.\\n\\n\\nWe could get there by March.

They know March will define the season. Unless they have the McKale energy or feel threatened on the road (i.e., Eugene), a first-rate effort is difficult to muster.

      "            \"summary\": \"Don't bother searching for the root cause of Arizona's come-from-ahead loss at Oregon State. The Hotline solved the riddle. The same answer applies to Arizona's loss at Washington State two weeks ago and Arizona's loss at Stanford two weeks before that.\\n\\nWinning on the road is hard, folks.\\n\\nAt the midpoint of the Pac-12 season, road teams have a 16-40 record in conference play \\u2014 a winning percentage of just 28.6.\\n\\nEach game follows a different course. Perhaps poor shooting by the visitors is the cause. Or officiating that leans toward the home team. Or a singular performance akin to what we saw last week in Corvallis from OSU guard Jordan Pope.\\n\\nIt all adds up to the same conclusion. And in the Pac-12, winning on the road this season is substantially more difficult than in recent years.\\n\\nWe avoided pre-COVID data, and we skipped the 2020-21 season because of the obvious disruption caused by the pandemic.\\n\\nBut it's worth noting that road teams won 42.5 percent of conference games (raw record: 51-69) during the 2021-22 season, a high level of success perhaps attributable to the lingering impact of COVID on attendance. (Home games carried a neutral-court vibe.)\\n\\nThe numbers dropped in the 2022-23 season, which was normal in every regard: Road teams were just 44-76, a winning percentage of 36.7.\\n\\nIf the current pace (28.6%) holds through the final five weeks of conference play, the visitors will finish this season with a 34-86 record.\\n\\nAnd that pace could be worse. Five of the 16 road wins thus far have come by three points or less. Had a few bounces gone for the hosts instead of the visitors, the win rate for road teams would be on the low side of 25 percent.\\n\\nWe could get there by March. As the grind of the season takes hold and legs become heavy, energy from the home crowd will assume a greater role in shaping the course of events.\\n\\nTo the power ratings \\u2026\\n\\n1. Arizona (15-5/6-3)\\n\\nLast week: 1\\nResults: lost at Oregon State 83-80, won at Oregon 87-78\\nNET ranking: No. 4\\nNext up: vs. Cal (Thursday)\\nComment: At the risk of offending, allow the Hotline to offer another theory for the Wildcats' erratic performances: midseason boredom. They know March will define the season. Unless they have the McKale energy or feel threatened on the road (i.e., Eugene), a first-rate effort is difficult to muster. And if that's the case, well, Arizona would hardly be the first team to experience a midseason lull.\\n\\n2. Oregon (14-6/6-3)\\n\\nLast week: 4\\nResults: beat ASU 80-61, lost to Arizona 87-78\\nNET ranking: No. 54\\nNext up: at USC (Thursday)\\nComment: The glaring shortcoming within Oregon's resume: 11 of the 14 victories are classified as Quadrant III or IV results.

Colorado (15-6/6-4)\\n\\nLast week: 3\\nResults: won at Washington 98-81, lost at WSU 78-69\\nNET ranking: No. 29\\nNext up: at Utah (Saturday)\\nComment: Success in road and neutral-court games is central to the NCAA selection process, because the tournament isn't played on home floors. The Buffaloes are 3-6 outside of Boulder, a tick better than their Mountain neighbor, Utah, which is 3-7.\\n\\n5. Utah (14-7/5-5)\\n\\nLast week: 2\\nResults: lost at WSU 79-57 and Washington 98-73\\nNET ranking: No. 37\\nNext up: vs. Colorado (Saturday)\\nComment: Doesn't matter if the venues are at sea level or the bottom of the Mariana Trench. Utah should not lose by 20-something points to the Huskies or Cougars \\u2014 not if Craig Smith and Co. hope to avoid the NCAA bubble.\\n\\n6.

Stanford (10-9/5-4)\\n\\nLast week: 7\\nResults: lost at Cal 73-71\\nNET ranking: No. 109\\nNext up: at Arizona State (Thursday)\\nComment: Recent results in the desert suggest trouble ahead: Stanford has one win in Tempe in the past decade and a single victory in Tucson in the past 15 years. A split should be treated like a sweep.\\n\\n9. Washington (12-9/4-6)\\n\\nLast week: 8\\nResults: lost to Colorado 98-81, beat Utah 98-73\\nNET ranking: No. 73\\nNext up: vs. WSU (Saturday)\\nComment: From what we've seen, the Huskies are slightly more competent offensively than they have been in recent years, but that improvement hasn't translated to a better bottom line. After 10 conference games last season, UW was \\u2026 4-6.\\n\\n10.

'We have been pushing this [fixed rig] boulder for four to five years and it's finally started to roll.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tBeyond \\nSquid Game \\nand \\nAlone, \\nHay said his team is also expanding the technique by which robotic cameras and microphones are used to capture real-life events to other genres, pointing to premium documentary series such as the BBC's \\nOur Falklands War \\nand an upcoming feature-length on the miners' strike.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t'We are evolving from being a company best known for domestic fixed rig shows to being a company that still has fixed rig at its heart but is taking something we've learned from that and applying it across a wider range of genres,' said Hay.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Garden has two soon-to-be-revealed greenlights for streamers that tap into this DNA, Hay revealed, as he cautiously welcomed a 'good moment' for the \\nITV Studios\\n-owned company amidst a tricky time for the UK TV industry.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tA trio of The Garden promotions will solidify the new strategy, with Lucie Duxbury becoming Head of Programmes, Spencer Kelly taking on Director of Factual and \\n24 Hours in Police Custody \\nseries director Jermaine Blake joining as EP. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nL to R: Jermaine Blake, Lucie Duxbury, Spencer Kelly\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe three will bolster the company's senior team as Creative Director Nic Brown returns from maternity leave to take charge of the slate, and Brown said the move is testament to The Garden's commitment to training up the next generation on its long-running returners.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\t'Shows like \\n24 Hours in A&E \\nallow us to spread our work, give us new pools of talent and help people work at scale so are really important,' said Brown. Hay called these returners 'talent incubators' at a time when UK TV's ailing freelance community finds itself with its back against the wall.\\n\\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSquid Game: The Challenge \\ntopped Netflix viewer charts for weeks around the world and a second season is \\nalready in the \\nworks. The show took the world's most-watched TV drama and made it unscripted, bringing in 456 contestants and a record prize fund of $4.56M. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tThe Garden was successful in its bid to produce the series and was handed the keys alongside \\nThe Traitors \\nmaker \\nStudio Lambert\\n. While there were \\ncertainly teething problems\\n, the pair have come in for praise for bringing their particular expertise to the smash show \\u2013 The Garden with its fixed rig specialism and Studio Lambert with \\nedge-of-the-seat constructed reality\\n. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHay, however, said The Garden's contribution was 'broader' than fixed rig and spotlighted its work making shows about people who find themselves up against the ropes. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\t'I expect half of the producers in the world were talking to Netflix about adapting \\nSquid Game,\\n'\\n \\nhe added. 'There was a sense of creative cross-pollination, about what might spark creatively if you put people coming from different directions into the same conversation. We have plenty of experience with shows about characters under pressure, whether that's having a major accident or being in a police interview room or trying to scratch a shape from a cookie.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHay said \\nThe Challenge \\nwas 'like nothing else I have ever done and even Steven [Lambert, boss of Studio Lambert] said that halfway through.' \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tWhile the model of two production companies working together is more common in the U.S., Hay suggested that the UK industry will see more collaborations in the vein of The Garden and Studio Lambert. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHe backed\\n Lambert's recent proclamation\\n that the success of shows like \\nThe Challenge \\ncould lead buyers to opt for premium unscripted over drama. 'My sense is unscripted shows at scale are delivering big audiences,' he added. 'People keep buying what works so there will be appetite for it.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tBrown, who was on set in Hertfordshire for weeks, revealed she gave birth just four hours after the cameras were turned off. 'I was thinking to myself \\u2018just get to the end of the shoot',' she said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tWhile UK TV is in a 'tough moment' with a commissioning slowdown that has hit Hay's former employer Channel 4 particularly hard, Hay said 'the potential opportunities out there are exciting and having both terrestrial buyers and streamers in full play gifts different kinds of opportunity,' as he contrasted the size and scale of \\nThe Challenge \\nwith a highly-rated episode of \\n24 Hours in Police Custody \\nabout male rape that was 'pure PSB.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tAlso on the horizon for The Garden is Channel 4's \\nDark Phone, \\ntelling the story of an extraordinary police operation to access an encrypted phone network used by organized crime groups around the world, which took place four years ago.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tAlthough The Garden is 'desperate to get it on air,' Brown revealed that premiere has been pushed back due to legal proceedings.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tFor 74 days, the messages sent and received on 60,000 handsets were covertly captured by police and Brown said the mundane messages contained in the 'treasure trove' are as interesting an insight into criminality as the standout ones.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\tHay added: 'The everyday chatter takes you there in a way that nothing else ever would and as ever proves that unscripted is weirder than scripted in that world. There's a real sense watching it what it must be like to be in their heads.'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSubscribe to \\n Breaking News Alerts\\n and keep your inbox happy.\",\n",

But some scientists say there's an urgent need to protect any moon-based astronomical equipment from interference caused by other planned activities on \\nthe moon\\n, ensuring they can carry out their mission of probing the surrounding universe.\\nTo that end, efforts are ongoing to scope out and create policy in conjunction with the United Nations in the hope of fostering international support for such protections.\\nRelated: \\nGravitational wave detectors on the moon could be more sensitive than those on Earth\\nThis action plan is spearheaded by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The IAU brings together more than 12,000 active professional astronomers from over 100 countries worldwide.\\nRichard Green is chair of the IAU group specific to looking at the issues of staging astronomy from the moon. He is also an assistant director for government relations at Steward Observatory, run by the University of Arizona in Tucson.\\nThe IAU working group is aiming to collaborate with a number of other non-governmental organizations to protect the option of doing astronomy from the moon, Green tells Space.com.\\u00a0\\nA number of participants in the IAU working group are spectrum managers from radio observatories, strongly linked to the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and ITU's World Radiocommunication Conference, a treaty-level forum to review and revise, if necessary, radio regulations and global agreements regarding use of the radio-frequency spectrum and the geostationary-satellite and non-geostationary-satellite orbits.\\nThe working group members want to maximize the range of protected frequencies, \\\"including the very low frequencies needed to study the early universe and auroral emissions from planets,\\\" Green says.\\nEquitable access\\nThe other approach, says Green is for protection of sites on the moon that might be suitable for cooled infrared telescopes or \\ngravitational wave\\n detector arrays.\\u00a0\\n\\\"We have common cause with those who want to protect historical legacy sites and even those who want dedicated sites for extracting water or minerals,\\\" Green says. \\\"We imagine that the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is the venue in which some process can be developed to claim a site for protection and to resolve competing claims.\\\"\\nThe IAU Astronomy from the moon working group has space law and policy experts who can provide a strong basis for that approach, Green says.\\n\\\"Of course, the main goal is to conduct astronomical observations that can be uniquely done from the moon,\\\" Green explains. The working group is embracing the expertise of principal investigators of lunar missions or concepts for missions.\\u00a0\\nDoing so, Green says, can help engage the astronomical community in prioritizing sites of extreme scientific interest and take in issues of conducting science in an environment for which \\\"equitable access\\\" is anchored in the spirit of the United Nations 1967 \\nOuter Space Treaty\\n.\\n(Image credit: Volodymyr Vustyansky)\\nA thumbs-up approval of the IAU initiative is Ian Crawford, a professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck College, London.\\u00a0\\n\\\"My own view is that a subset of lunar locations, for example specific polar craters and key far side locations, need to be designated as 'Sites of Special Scientific Importance' and protected as such, Crawford told Space.com.\\nA possible\\u00a0model, Crawford suggests, might be the\\u00a0Antarctic Specially Protected Areas (ASPAs) as defined in Annex V of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty.\\n\\\"In any case, international coordination is clearly required so United Nations involvement appears entirely appropriate,\\\" Crawford says.\\nPrivate partnerships\\u00a0\\nNASA is working with several U.S. firms to deliver science and technology to the moon's surface by way of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services (\\nCLPS\\n) initiative.\\nGiven the uptick in future CLPS-enabled robotic lunar exploration, we are about to the see the first NASA-funded science payloads landed there in over 51 years \\u2014 since the \\nApollo 17\\n human moon landing in December 1972, says Jack Burns, professor emeritus in the department of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado, Boulder.\\nOne payload, for which Burns serves as co-investigator, is called the Radio Wave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath (\\nROLSES\\n).

That includes well-manicured hiking trails on the adjacent Aldis Hill. But local historians say that back in the day the scenery was rather rough and tumble.\\n\\n\\nOld-timers attest a grey wolf was running wild in the area and killing the livestock of local farmers. One crisp autumn day in 1839, Lawrence Brainerd finally had enough. Firearm in hand, he hiked to the top of the 850-foot-hill and once-and-for-all showed the aggressive animal who's boss.\\n\\n\\nTo this day, there's no agreement on who erected the 1,700-pound stone monument\\u2026 and why. Some surmise Brainerd's son-in-law (railroad exec turned Vermont governor J. Gregory Smith) placed the marker to promote regional pride and as a kind of offbeat tourist attraction. News reports at the time noted there was 'much excitement at the slaying of the animal.'\\n\\n\\nThe monument was originally laid horizontally in the ground. This caused it to get constantly covered in dirt, leaves, and snow. Wishing to preserve local history (and perhaps legend), in the summer of 2023 a group of volunteers relocated the marker a few feet from its original location and attached it to a nearby boulder using hydraulic cement and steel rebar.\\n\\n\\nOnce a landmark that was simply stumbled upon if you were lucky (many explorers gave up in frustration), today a short trail is clearly marked as 'Wolf Monument Way.'\\n \\nThe stone's inscription reads: 'On this spot in the year 1839 Lawrence Brainerd shot a grey wolf which had been ravaging the Northeast part of Franklin Co. The great beast measured six feet in length.'\",\n",

Initial capabilities will be demonstrated in the fields of soil carbon, wildfire resilience, methane quantification, extreme weather, and water management. The effort will also help build the workforce needed to implement these solutions.\\n\\n\\nCSU will play a lead role in project governance, in establishing the technology roadmap, and in working with industry and entrepreneurial partners to accelerate widespread adoption of the solutions developed.\\n\\n\\nCSU President Amy Parsons\\n said the collaborative nature of the large project, the workforce development aspects, and the focus on getting solutions out of the lab and into the world matched with the university's core mission as a land-grant institution.\\n\\n\\n'The CO-WY Engine is a groundbreaking opportunity to create impact and address climate adaptation, workforce readiness and community resilience,' said Parsons. 'CSU is honored to engage in this effort with our partners across the region and we look forward to the important work we will accomplish together.'\\n\\n\\nPartners on the project include the Colorado School of Mines, University of Wyoming, University of Colorado Boulder, the University of Northern Colorado, and University of Colorado Denver. Workforce development efforts will be led by the community college systems of Colorado and Wyoming, along with Metropolitan State University of Denver and TalentCO. Other support comes from five federal labs, tribal communities, and a collection of industry partners in both states that will be involved in the project.\\n\\n\\nNorthern Colorado-based \\nInnosphere Ventures\\n will lead the CO-WY Engine. CSU and Innosphere have a 25-year partnership around growing the region's high-tech entrepreneurship ecosystem, including commercialization efforts, incubation programs, and supporting founders who are launching science and tech startups.\\n\\n\\n'The CO-WY Engine will be instrumental in bringing technology-driven solutions to life, growing our two-state economy, and reshaping our region's approach to climate resilience,' said Mike Freeman, CEO of Innosphere Ventures and incoming CEO for the CO-WY Climate Resilience Engine. 'In ten years, the CO-WY Engine will generate significant economic impact for our region, including 22,000 new climate technology-related jobs, $1.5 billion in regional GDP impact, more than $1 billion in private capital formation, train or reskill more than 2,000 individuals, and distribute $80 million in commercialization grants to startups in the climate technology sector.'\\n\\n\\nThe engine effort includes a distinct community focus. It includes several components to expand regional economic development activity as well as opportunities for stakeholders \\u2013 particularly under-represented communities \\u2013 to participate.\\n\\n\\nContinuing and expanding climate research on campus\\n\\n\\nCSU Vice President for Research Cassandra Moseley\\n said the university has a strong research foundation in both the technical and social dimensions of the project. She noted that six of CSU's colleges were involved in the project proposal, in addition to institutional partners at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Atmosphere, the Colorado Climate Center, and the Urban Water Innovation Network, among others.\\n\\n\\n'CSU has vast experience and expertise in translating research into practical solutions that are ready for the field and create tangible impact \\u2013 particularly when it comes to sustainability,' she said. 'Our researchers are looking forward to this opportunity to elevate our connection with our peers and to collaboratively support the entire region's ability to measure, monitor and predict its changing environment and mitigate potential socioeconomic impacts on our communities.'\\n\\n\\nThe \\nCSU Energy Institute\\n and affiliated faculty in the \\n\\n were key in securing the project. The institute has served for decades as a hub for interdisciplinary research in the fields of energy and climate solutions. Energy Institute Executive Director Bryan Willson said the new project will continue university-wide efforts to improve the ability to measure, predict, mitigate, and adapt to a changing environment.\\n\\n\\n'Energy Institute researchers have a 30-year history of developing solutions in this space and working with partners in industry, government, and the nonprofit sector to implement the solutions at large scale,' said Willson, who is also a professor in the \\nDepartment of Mechanical Engineering.\\n 'This interdisciplinary work coming out of the CO-WY Engine will increase the economic viability of carbon and climate solutions and help to educate the workforce of tomorrow that we will need to operate them.'\\n\\n\\nAbout Research at CSU\\n\\n\\nColorado State University, a Carnegie R1 institution, reached $498.1 million in sponsored project expenditures in 2023, representing a 62% funding increase in the last decade and expanded impact and discovery across all eight colleges.

      "            \"summary\": \"For the first time in more than two decades, Folsom Field will see new concert acts outside of Dead & Company this summer, including its first electronic music group.\\n\\n'It's going to be awesome. It's going to be a great production and a lot of fun,' Ryan Gottlieb, University of Colorado Boulder senior associate athletic director said, adding, 'It's really cool to have shows with modern music that has a young audience and young fanbase.'\\n\\nIn October, CU Boulder announced singer Tyler Childers will be performing at Folsom Field on Aug. 17, whose music is a mix of country, bluegrass and folk. On Monday, the university announced the electronic group Odesza will perform on June 29. It will be the first electronic music concert ever held at Folsom.\\n\\n'I think these shows are going to bring a new and unique vibe to Folsom and Boulder and they should both perform extraordinarily well,' Gottlieb said.\\n\\nDon Strasburg, co-president of AEG Presents Rocky Mountains and Pacific Northwest, has been working with CU Boulder to find other concerts and opportunities after Dead & Co. had their last shows at Folsom in July.\\n\\n'I'm really pumped,' Strasburg said. 'This year, having two new artists that AEG Presents is bringing to the community, Odesza and Tyler Childers, are showing that there is a larger scope and breadth of entertainment that fits in Folsom Field and in Boulder.'\\n\\nOdesza will be the first new act at Folsom since Dead & Co. started performing there in 2016. Before 2016, there was a 15-year period where no concerts were held at Folsom Field. However, the venue has a legacy of hosting some big-name musicians and bands, especially during the '70s and '80s, with concerts from acts like Fleetwood Mac, the Rolling Stones and Paul McCartney.\\n\\nAfter Dead & Co. held its final shows at Folsom in July, CU Boulder said it sought to continue concerts by seeking new acts.\\n\\n'We knew we would have to be creative to find some new stuff,' Gottlieb said.\\n\\nGottlieb said CU Boulder hopes to host anywhere from two to four or five shows a year. The university does profit from hosting concerts, and the revenue goes toward supporting a variety of departments on campus, including athletics, the CU Boulder Police Department, parking services and facilities management.\\n\\nCU Boulder wants to program multiple summer events in the stadium, Gottlieb said, because of the impact on the university and the Boulder community, including hotels, restaurants and retail shops.\\n\\n'Those groups just see such a massive lift when there's a concert,' he said. 'It's great for us and it's great for the community.'\\n\\nThe Visit Boulder Convention and Visitors Bureau conducted an economic impact report for the final three Dead & Co. shows. A $31 million direct impact was calculated, in addition to a $48 million total impact.\\n\\nThe direct economic impact includes direct spending by visitors, organizers, media and sponsors for purchases related to lodging, transportation, food and drink, retail and recreation. The total impact represents the indirect additional spending by local businesses and by employees through generated income. It also includes the spending that leaks outside of the local economy, due to the purchase of goods, services and raw materials by locals and event organizers.\\n\\nThose calculations were run knowing that 44,000 people attended day one and two and 38,000 attended day three.\\n\\n'Bringing large-scale events to Boulder brings a vitality that permeates all the aspects of the community,' Strasburg said. 'And that vitality is ephemeral in the sense that it makes for fun things to do in the community, but it's also financial because a lot of people come to the concert and spend money.'\\n\\nJohn Tayer, president and CEO of the Boulder Chamber, said the chamber is looking forward to making sure the concerts are a positive experience for visitors, residents and businesses.\\n\\n'We love the diversity of entertainment that CU is attracting to our community and the audiences that we enjoy welcoming to our restaurants, retail and hotel venues,' Tayer said.\\n\\nTickets for Tyler Childers are available online. Presales for Odesza start at 10 a.m. Wednesday and general sales start at 10 a.m. Friday.

That's going to give students a really interesting view.'\\n\\nSenior Kyle Smith said it's exciting to have experts from the sports industry come to class, including Coach Prime. There are 10 guest speakers from within CU Boulder or that are alumni, including former NFL player and CU Buffs quarterback Kordell Stewart, USA Today Sports Reporter Brent Schrotenboer and Tom Garfinkel, the president of the Miami Dolphins.\\n\\n'I don't want to say I'm star stuck or anything, but it is pretty cool \\u2026 it adds an element of excitement to the class,' Smith said. 'But students are really engaged and want to learn more because these professional athletes and speakers are coming in and you want to learn what they're talking about.'\\n\\nThe class is being co-taught by 12 faculty members from five different departments. The class is mainly targeted for student-athletes, journalism students and students interested in sports business.\\n\\n'This is one of those situations where in the last couple of years we had seen suddenly the landscape of collegiate sports shifting,' Stevens said. 'We had seen formerly purely amateur regulated student-athletes suddenly get the ability to earn some income off of their likeness and very little regulations or guidelines on how that's supposed to happen.'\\n\\nThe course will cover sports culture, history, changing legal landscape, media culture, celebrity theory, social media, advertising and branding and public relations. Discussions will be about the business of sports and how it evolves around collegiate athletics and thinking about student-athletes as a new kind of celebrity.\\n\\nStevens said the goal is to teach the student-athletes in the class about how to use their voice in spotlight, attract commercial attention, be able to speak about social justice issues, develop a personal brand and more.\\n\\n'It's about thinking about that Prime Time persona, the Prime Time moment that an athlete has,' Stevens said.\\n\\nThe course also aims to teach journalism students how they should think about covering NIL issues and develop empathy for 18- and 19-year-olds who are trying to form public identities. For the sports business side, Stevens said, he wants students to know how the system works.\\n\\n'We want there to be more critical thinking around a lot of these changing situations so that students can add to whatever career they are pursuing related to these topics,' Stevens said.\\n\\nJamie Skerski, associate teaching professor in communications, will teach about the intersection of communication and culture and thinking about sports as an entertainment industry. Her goal is to nuance the conversation around NIL and the transfer portal and how the college athletic system is changing, while also thinking about gender.\\n\\n'College athletics is a different beast than it was even three or four years ago,' Skerski said. 'And so for me, if we're training sports journalists, it's important for them to understand the history and context of these changes and who benefits from these changes.'\\n\\nSenior Nick Wilson wants to be a manager in the music or sports industry and hopes to gain a better understanding of NIL deals and how to negotiate them. Wilson said he enjoys the class structure with its combination of guest lecturers and multiple professors.\\n\\n'It makes the class more exciting and makes me actually want to dig into this stuff a little more,' Wilson said. 'It's an exciting opportunity to see Prime Time and connect with the players and everyone else.'\\n\\nPat Ferrucci, associate professor and chair of the journalism department, will focus on teaching about leadership and how leadership can affect people and transform an organization. He hopes students take away how connected sports are to economics, culture, fandom, gender, race and more.\\n\\n'I hope that they take away how complicated everything is,' Ferrucci said. 'That's something that no matter what we're teaching students, I hope comes together.'\\n\\nSophomore Ashlin Stasswender Swasey said she's excited about the class because of the unique opportunity of having guest speakers.\\n\\n'I'm hoping to get a better understanding about the intersection between athletes and celebrity, how that's formulated and the impact that has,' she said.\\n\\nSkerski said NIL opened up a lot of questions, and no one knows how it's going to work. Part of the course is to think about how to do it equitably.\\n\\n'I hope students start thinking critically about sport as an institution that it's not a about the wins and losses or necessarily the players, it's about the way sport is a microcosm of society,' Skerski said. 'As an entertainment industry, what are all the factors in the cultural production that is taking place with sport in the way we value certain sports like football, for instance, over others? Or why do some sports have television contracts and broadcasting rights and others don't? I hope students start thinking about sport as a very influential way that whether you're a sports fan or not, you learn about culture.'\",\n",

So we're getting out our crystal ball to predict what will be hot this year with restaurants and bars.\\n\\n\\nHere are nine food and drink trends you might catch a glimpse of in local kitchens in 2024.\\n\\n\\nMakFam's MSGin is a playful riff on a gin martini with Chinese plum brine and MSG. (Provided by MAKfam)\\n\\n\\nMSG\\n\\n\\nMonosodium glutamate (MSG) is a food additive used to enhance flavor, and local spots like MAKfam and Death & Company are embracing the ingredient to dispel the common misconception that MSG is any worse for you than anything else.\\n\\n\\nDenver cocktail bar \\nDeath & Co.\\n, on the ground floor of the Ramble Hotel in RiNo, recently introduced its Wavelength cocktail with Chardonnay barrel-aged gin, bitters, sherry, tomato, passion fruit and MSG. \\n\\n\\nMAKfam, a Cantonese restaurant \\nthat opened in October\\n, has a playful piece of art on its wall featuring the slogan 'It's better with MSG,' as well as a riff on a gin martini dubbed 'MSGin' with Chinese plum brine and MSG. \\n \\n'We're proud to say we use MSG in our food, and I feel like there's a lot of negative connotation with it, but you could say the same thing about sugar, and we want to take that idea back,' co-owner Kenneth Wan previously told The Denver Post. \\n\\n\\nAt Cantina Loca, the Espresso Martinez is made with Fruitful Coconut Liqueur, 477 Coffee Liqueur, Bluegrass Cold Brew, Aztec Chocolate Bitters and agave syrup. (Provided by Cantina Loca)\\n\\n\\nEspresso martinis\\n\\n\\nThe espresso martini's recent revival has given diners a pep in their step, whether you prefer the caffeine-infused cocktail for a jolt of energy before dinner or paired with dessert to end the meal. \\nDenver restaurants\\n aren't missing out on this three-bean trend, and nearly every drink menu boasts some sort of rendition of the creamy cocktail.\\n \\nLogan Street Restaurant & Bar\\n is a particular date-night favorite with a classic espresso martini on the menu. Or you can shake it up with a tequila-based Espresso Martinez with Fruitful Coconut Liqueur, 477 Coffee Liqueur, Bluegrass Cold Brew, Aztec Chocolate Bitters and agave syrup at \\nCantina Loca\\n.\\n\\n\\nOut-of-state chefs and brands\\n\\n\\nDenver is on almost everyone's radar these days, and an increasing number of out-of-state chefs and brands continue to expand here to get a piece of the Mile High pie.\\n\\n\\nWhether it's for a shot at \\na Michelin star\\n or just to enjoy the vast outdoor activities we have to offer, the transplants just keep coming. This year, Portland-based chef Carlo Lamagna plans to open \\nMagna Kainan\\n, a Filipino restaurant in RiNo. Also, \\nLe Colonial\\n, a Vietnamese-French, fine-dining restaurant with locations in Chicago, Houston and Atlanta, is opening its first Denver spot in Cherry Creek. And South Carolina-based 5th Street Group is expanding\\u00a0 its \\nChurch and Union\\n, an upscale, New American concept, to Denver in June 2024. \\n\\n\\nTexas-based gas station chain Buc-ee's is getting in on the action, too, with its \\nfirst Colorado outpost\\n opening in Johnstown this March, and \\nChicago-based Portillo's\\n is also eyeing Colorado for a first-time expansion. \\n\\n\\nCongress Park Market's Japanese egg salad sandwich. (Provided by Congress Park Market)\\n\\n\\nGlobal sandwiches\\n\\n\\nDenver's sandwich game is having a bit of a renaissance. \\nMore and more bakery owners with culinary backgrounds\\n are having fun in the kitchen, combining their bread skills with their savory appetites. In turn, sandwiches are leveling up from the usual turkey and ham stacks with global influences.\\n\\n\\nCongress Park Market, \\nowned by Spinelli's\\n, features a Japanese egg salad sandwich ($13.99) with shallot and rice vinegar on a homemade Shokupan loaf by chef Michael Neale, who previously worked at the upscale Chinese food restaurant Hop Alley. GetRight's, owned by former chef Matt Dulin, experiments with sandwich and pizza specials every week, like a recent French-inspired, scrambled egg sandwich with black truffle on a fresh-baked croissant.\\n\\n\\nFancy mocktails\\n\\n\\nBartenders take their mocktails as seriously as a shaken martini or expert Old Fashioned these days, especially as more diners take their turns at \\nDry January\\n.\\n\\n\\nDenver restaurants like \\nRooted Craft Kitchen\\n in Highland have created zero-proof elixirs that make it easy to forget why you ever needed to add alcohol to it in the first place. Level up your mocktail game with the Yuz Me Up ($10) with yuzu, Fresno peppers, rice wine vinegar and tonic.\\n\\n\\n'Having interesting non-alcoholic beverages is a must for any restaurant in 2024, with more people choosing not to consume booze yet still wanting a well-crafted cocktail,' said Rooted co-owner and beverage director Scott Ericson. 'Our shrubs have an intensity of flavor, with a bite. The vinegar does a great job of taking the place of the alcohol.'\\n\\n\\nBlackbelly Market's head butcher, Kelly Kawachi, shows off her Michelin award, along with Blackbelly owner Hosea Rosenberg with the restaurant's green sustainability Star. (Photo by Marc Patrick)\\n\\n\\nSustainable sourcing\\n\\n\\nMichelin doled out sustainability awards to Denver restaurateur Kelly Whitaker's Bruto and The Wolf's Tailor in Denver, as well as Blackbelly Market and Bramble & Hare in Boulder at the guide's \\ninaugural ceremony in Colorado\\n this year.\\n\\n\\nThey were recognized for their above-and-beyond sustainable practices, like \\nBlackbelly's in-house butcher program\\n and work with local ranchers and farmers, or Bruto's food-waste management through fermentation and its in-house milling process.\\n \\nAnd this year, we're going to see an emphasis on sustainable sources among restaurant menus, like C Burger by local restaurateur Bryan Dayton, who's behind popular spots like Corrida, Oak at Fourteenth and Brider. C Burger, which has a kiosk within Sanitas Brewing Co. in Englewood and \\na second Boulder location\\n on the way, focuses on regenerative, organic and local meat. \\n\\n\\nDiversified dumplings\\n\\n\\nDumplings in Denver have long since branched out from the typical pork and chicken stuffings. We've seen French onion soup dumplings rise in popularity at ChoLon, but newcomers like \\nNana's Dim Sum\\n, \\nSeoul ManDoo\\n, \\nMoMo House\\n and \\nYuan Wonton\\n have also joined the dumpling race with their diversified selections.\\n\\n\\nGet out of your dumpling comfort zone with beef and cheese dumplings from Nana's, a fried Korean dumpling with kimchi from Seoul ManDoo, a Sichuan eggplant dumpling from Yuan Wonton or a Nepalese tofu treat from MoMo House.\\n\\n\\nCustomers dine at Annette in Stanley Marketplace in Aurora on Nov. 28, 2023. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\\n\\n\\nApproachable luxury\\n\\n\\nLuxury is no longer defined by exclusivity. Denver diners are finding more value in approachable, down-to-earth experiences than they are in white tablecloths and suited service \\nat fine-dining restaurants\\n. Upscale spots like Beckon and Annette provide luxury through personable experiences and educated meals, in which waiters walk you through every bite. Servers are dressed in T-shirts and the wooden tables are bare with eccentric plateware to create a more laid-back ambiance. \\n\\n\\nThree Saints Revival's bread services come with a trio of spreads, including Serrano chili butter, edamame hummus and porcini pimento chili crisp. (Provided by Three Saints Revival)\\n\\n\\nGirl dinner\\n\\n\\nThe \\n'girl dinner'\\n became popular on TikTok in 2023 when millions of women posted their favorite way to enjoy a meal by themselves. Essentially, the trend is focused on snacks as meals, whether that's a charcuterie board, a spread of dips, some caviar and potato chips or just a block of cheese and some crackers.\\n\\n\\nDenver restaurants are embracing the 'girl dinner' as more diners choose to nibble on a spread of small bites rather than indulging in a large, hearty entree. Spots like Safta and Ash'Kara are already perfect for an array of mezze platters, like hummus dip, labneh and falafel. Three Saints Revival in downtown Denver has also introduced a new bread service with a Trio of Schmeers for snacking, including Serrano chili butter, edamame hummus and porcini pimento chili crisp.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"At first, Bruce Brown thought the substance in his son's room was a performance supplement, like the plastic bottles alongside it. He'd never heard of sodium nitrite, so he searched it on the internet.\\n\\n\\nBut he accidentally typed in the wrong word, searching instead for sodium nitrate. Still, even the results for the wrong substance set off an alarm in his head. It didn't seem like something that his son, Bennett, should be taking. So he texted him.\\n\\n\\nThe next day, Bennett died by suicide at age 17. He'd ordered a highly concentrated amount of sodium nitrite, a salt used as a preservative on meats, from a sporting goods store out of state. It cost less than a movie ticket, and it arrived with two-day shipping.\\n\\n\\n'The store knew what he was likely using this product for,' Brown, a former prosecutor who lives in Clear Creek County, told Colorado legislators Thursday. 'I sent an investigator there after he died, and what did the manager say? \\u2018Sure, we know people are killing themselves with this. Not our problem.' '\\n\\n\\nBennett, who would've turned 19 this week, is one of at least 29 Coloradans who've died by suicide after ingesting sodium nitrite since 2018, according to state data. Hundreds more have died nationally after taking a poison that could be purchased on Amazon, in sporting goods stores and elsewhere on the internet. Reviews for the product on Amazon were filled with pleading warnings from grieving families, according to an attorney who later sued the company.\\n\\n\\nAs lawmakers in other states and at the national level scrutinize the availability of the substance, Colorado may be on the verge of banning it in its most deadly form. On Thursday, after testimony from three families who'd lost loved ones to it, a bipartisan \\u2014 and emotional \\u2014 committee of state lawmakers unanimously advanced \\nHB24-1081.\\n \\nThe bill would ban the sale of high-potency sodium nitrite \\u2014 more than 10% pure \\u2014 to Coloradans, except approved commercial businesses, in a bid to slow deaths \\nin a state that regularly has one of the highest suicide rates in the country.\\n The substance that Bennett ordered was 97% pure, his father said.\\n\\n\\n'It is incumbent on us to do what we can to save lives,' said Rep. Judy Amabile, a Boulder Democrat who's co-sponsoring the bill with Rep. Marc Catlin, a Montrose Republican. 'And this bill will save lives.'\\n \\nThe bill, which also requires the use of warning labels on approved sales to highlight the substance's lethality, is scheduled for its first of two full votes in the Colorado House on Tuesday. No group or person has registered to oppose it, according to lobbying data from the Colorado Secretary of State's Office.\\n\\n\\nRegulators and lawyers elsewhere previously have\\u00a0sought to limit the poison's availability. Carrie Goldberg, a New York-based attorney, told lawmakers that she currently represents 12 families in five separate lawsuits filed against Amazon.\\n\\n\\nTwo U.S. senators sponsored \\na bill in July\\n to ban the sale of high-concentrate sodium nitrite, similar to Colorado's approach, and \\nfederal lawmakers sought answers\\n about sales of the substance from Amazon in 2022. Legislators in California and New York have both considered \\u2014 and California passed \\u2014 age-based bans on the poison, intending to limit its sales to younger people.\\n\\n\\nBut Colorado data indicates it's used by more than just teenagers: According to figures provided by the state Department of Public Health and Environment, 23 of the recent deaths here have been in residents who were 25 or older.\\n\\n\\nAmabile and Brown said they suspected more Coloradans \\u2014 and more Americans \\u2014 were dying of the poison than data suggests. The use of sodium nitrite in suicide is increasing thanks to online boosters, they said, but testing for it is still not universal. Brown said he's spoken with grieving parents and families from across the world, including some linked to a Canadian man \\nwho was investigated for selling sodium nitrite kits to dozens of people\\n.\\n\\n\\nAmabile first heard about the substance at a town hall, when Brown approached her and Sen. Dylan Roberts, who's set to sponsor the bill in the state Senate. She called Catlin shortly after, not knowing that Catlin had also recently heard from a different constituent whose friend had lost a son to the poison.\\n\\n\\nCatlin said he wanted to intervene and limit sodium nitrite's availability before its use became an 'epidemic.' Amabile said she planned to bring a bill in the future to address websites that promoted death by sodium nitrite and suicide generally, dark corners of the internet that Brown said were run by 'grim reapers.'\\n \\nOn Thursday, an Erie family \\u2014 Peter Frankovsky, his wife Suzanne and their son Quinn \\u2014 told legislators about Sam Frankovsky, their son and brother, who died by suicide after ingesting the poison.\\n\\n\\n'The world is an absolute worse place because of his absence,' Quinn Frankovsky said of his brother. 'My family and I do not want to be here. It has felt like we are living new lives, as if our home has figuratively burned down.\\n\\n\\n'But it is the duty of the burdened to not stand idly by, watching this figurative fire burn down the houses and lives of our brothers and sisters. It is our civic and moral duty to extinguish this gross product from our community.'\",\n",

(Photo by RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of \\n\\n, Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n \\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National\\u00a0Monument\\n\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, \\nand worth a stay at the campground\\n. Want to learn more about it? There is \\na new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story\\n of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\n\\nPlein air painter Remington Robinson works on a painting on the Pearl Street Mall on April 28, 2023, in Boulder. (Photo by Helen H. Richardson/The Denver Post)\\n\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November \\nFodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024\\n (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, \\nas well as a Michelin-starred restaurant\\n (Frasca).\\n \\nCraft beer highway\\n\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which \\u2014 like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, \\nVerboten\\n and Zwei \\u2014 are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, \\nMount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky\\n after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners \\nthat motorists can drive to the top of\\n (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\n\\nIron Mountain Hot Springs.

Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like \\nGlenwood Hot Springs Resort\\n and \\nIron Mountain Hot Springs\\n, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from \\nCasey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom\\n.\\n\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range \\u2014 at any time of year, really \\u2014 in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the \\nGranada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site\\n, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore \\u2014 and to remember.\\n\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes \\nthe Mountain Plover Festival\\n different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES\\n\\n\\nFans watch the Colorado Rockies and the Arizona Diamondbacks during a spring training Cactus League game at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick on Feb. 25, 2023, in Scottsdale, Arizona. (Photo by RJ Sangosti/The Denver Post)\\n\\n\\nSpring training in Arizona\\n\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, \\nas we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale\\n, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s \\u2014 a nice break from cold Colorado weather \\u2014 and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, \\nbut there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest\\n.\\n\\n\\nA large bowl of roasted green chile at a market in Hatch, N.M. in 2021. (AP Photo/Susan Montoya Bryan, File)\\n\\n\\nHatch, N.M.\\n\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so youi can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\n\\nAsheville, N.C.\\n\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, N.C., in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since \\nDenver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months.\\n (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\n\\nVice President Kamala Harris, right, greets National Parks Service Superintendent Shirley MaKinney during a visit to the Stonewall Inn and National Monument, on June 26, 2023, in New York. (AP Photo/Mary Altaffer)\\n\\n\\nNew York City\\n \\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, '\\nThe Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism\\n' (Feb. 25\\u2013June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings \\u2014 which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (\\nor the path of 'totality'\\n), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called \\nCuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating\\n. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but \\n\\n \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\n\\nThe Olympic Games are coming to Paris this summer. (AP Photo/Francois Mori, File)\\n\\n\\nParis\\n\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. \\nAir France has been flying direct from DIA\\n in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, \\nis set to reopen in December 2024\\n.\\n\\n\\nDublin\\n\\n\\nFor being the \\nsixth-busiest airport in the entire world\\n, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\n\\nVisitors to Iceland's Blue Lagoon spa swim in pools of milky-blue, 99-degree geothermal waters.\\n\\n\\nIceland\\n\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since \\nthey are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis\\n, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and \\na magical group of rockabilly street performers\\n.\\n\\n\\nMorning at Jakes in Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth, Jamaica. (Provided by Jakes hotel)\\n\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' \\nas we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital\\n. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. \\nRead more about this sunny destination\\n \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become \\na hot travel destination in the past decade\\n, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\n\\nA vendor sells coconut drinks at a beach at Manuel Antonio in Costa Rica. (Evelyne Horovitz, The Washington Post)\\n\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but \\nCosta Rica has been particularly popular\\n recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to \\nThe Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park\\n. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Kyle Shanahan hoists the Lombardi Trophy high enough for the football gods to use as a toothpick. Little Shanny bear-hugs \\nquarterback Arch Manning\\n and \\nwideout Luke McCaffrey\\n, his co-MVPs. Then the three get busy picking orange and blue confetti out of smiles they can see from the windows of \\nthe ISS.\\n\\n\\nThe Broncos win Super Bowl LXV to launch a new Shanahan Dynasty, and the circle of NFL life completes itself. This one? This one's for Mike.\\n\\n\\n'You know what? Crazier things have happened,' Zach Zucker, Kyle Shanahan's longtime pal/confidant and \\nShanny's former Cherry Creek football teammate\\n, told me with a laugh a few days ago.\\n\\n\\n'Who knows? In five years, if the right opportunity comes along \\u2026'\\n\\n\\nShanny Week is almost upon us, that annual rite of passage where we see a whole bunch of people with Denver ties getting ready to play in the Super Bowl.\\n\\n\\nOnly since those people work for the San Francisco 49ers and not the Broncos, the knives come out. Front Range families pick sides over whether John Elway or Joe Ellis is more at fault, and X turns into Thanksgiving before an election year.\\n \\nIt's also the week in which Zucker has to hold his tongue like a loaf of bread, lest he fumble and the truth spills out.\\n\\n\\n'To be honest with you, I'm kind of like, \\u2018I know too much,'' he chuckled. 'I just kind of keep my mouth shut. (Or) Kyle will kill me.'\\n \\nHistory says the Broncos interviewed Little Shanny and Vance Joseph in January 2017 for their post-Kubiak head-coaching vacancy, and picked the latter. History says the decision helped banish one NFL blueblood (the Broncos) to the NFL hinterlands while opening the door for another (the 49ers) to rise from the ashes.\\n\\n\\nThe truth? The Broncos were too screwed up seven years ago for Little Shanny to kiss the sky here.\\n \\nOnly they didn't know it. Or if they did, they didn't care.\\n\\n\\nToo many egos. Too little space. Too little time. \\nPaxton Lynch.\\n Dove Valley still had a Super Bowl glow, its gatekeepers a Super Bowl hubris. Elway rode an elite, historic defense to the title and never quite shook free from that vision as the way forward. Even though multiple sources said Kyle hit his interview with the Broncos out of about five ballparks.\\n\\n\\nRight guy.\\n\\n\\nWrong time.\\n\\n\\n'It's not so simple,' Zucker explained. 'Listen, I feel bad for the Broncos that they didn't get Kyle, obviously.\\n\\n\\n'At that point and time, the Broncos were in a much better place. They were rocking, coming off Super Bowls. When Kyle went to interview with San Francisco, they were the worst team in the league \\u2014 worst offense, worst defense, worst special teams, worst everything. It was a complete start-over.'\\n\\n\\nIn a weird way, it wasn't dissimilar to Deion Sanders weighing the CU Buffs versus say, Ole Miss, South Carolina, or any other SEC middleweight. Here, Coach Prime's the program, the face, the front porch, the demigod. There, he's got better money, better recruits, better facilities, better infrastructure, better opponents \\u2014 and expectations through the stinking roof.\\n\\n\\nIn Columbia or Oxford, 4-8 gets you fired. In Boulder, \\nit gets you a Sports Illustrated cover\\n. Context matters.\\n\\n\\n'I would've absolutely loved Kyle to be here in Denver,' Zucker continued. 'I just think it would've been a lot \\u2014 for a lot of different reasons.\\n\\n\\n'Can you imagine walking in on that (franchise), coming behind your dad, and that whole thing, and how much respect the whole town had for (former Broncos coach) Mike Shanahan? There was no bones about it: We called (Mike), \\u2018The Man.''\\n\\n\\nDad raised the bar. Gary Kubiak matched it. The Niners, meanwhile, had crashed and burned after Jim Harbaugh bolted from the Bay, bottoming out with a 2-14 dumpster fire in the fall of 2016.\\n\\n\\nSan Fran gave Kyle a willing partner in ex-Bronco John Lynch as general manager, power, and a long runway. Ellis and Elway saw the Orange & Blue in 2017 \\nas a dynasty at its apex\\n, with so many pieces from a two-time Super Bowl roster still locked into place.\\n\\n\\n'Everything is timing, right?' Zucker said. 'It was just a situation (where) I think Kyle had great memories of being in (the Bay), it was in middle school when he'd spent a lot of time there. It was just an opportunity. The other thing I can tell you is that Kyle just absolutely loves \\n(Niners CEO) Jed (York)\\n. Jed has just given him an opportunity to do what he's doing, and look what's happened? Two NFC championships.'\\n\\n\\nTwo Super Bowls. Three straight NFC title game appearances. Four seasons of 10 wins or more since 2019. Everything Broncos Country ever dreamed of. And still do.\\n\\n\\n'It is what it is,' Zucker said. 'Everything happens for a reason. Kyle ended up, everybody ended up, where they were supposed to be. My feeling is, everything happened for a reason. Kyle was meant to be in San Francisco.'\\n\\n\\nForever? Who knows? In five years, George Kittle might decide to bail on football \\nto captain the U.S. curling team.\\n Come back, Kyle. All is forgiven.\\n\\n\\n'I just learned, being around the Shanahan family (from) a very young age, you never put anything out of the realm,' Zucker said. He laughed again. 'Things can happen.'\\n\\n\\nWant more sports news? Sign up for the Sports Omelette to get all our analysis on Denver's teams.\",\n",

The documentary mixes moments of natural beauty and art-making with the rending havoc of Russia's invasion of the Ukraine to moving if complex effect.\\n\\n\\nComplex because war films, even when they're arguing the right side of history, can be disquieting to those privileged enough to wonder about war movies and propaganda. It's a quandary I wrestled with during parts of 'Porcelain War.' One of the film's makers acknowledged that with grace but also rebuffed with hard-wrought acuity.\\n\\n\\n'Ukraine was a free country that was unjustly invaded,' Leontyev wrote in an email Tuesday. 'Millions of Ukrainians had to flee their homes, tens of thousands of Ukrainians have been killed. We captured the story of the people who have witnessed this, who are still experiencing it, and their perspective is their truth. They have no option but to fight back, and they deserve to have their feelings on the subject heard. They have the right to take pride in defending their home and the people they love. This war is a one-sided, senseless attack on people who want peace.'\\n\\n\\nIn a few weeks, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences will feature one of the strongest slates of major motion pictures in recent memory as it considers 'Oppenheimer,' 'Killers of the Flower Moon' and, yes, even 'Barbie' for awards.

Like 'Porcelain War,' so many of the festival's award-winners were in many ways love stories. No, not romances in the traditional sense (though there were those), but films that foregrounded the familial in ways often set against themes as grand as last year's very fine behemoths. Be it war, addiction, unexpected death, even genocide, these films focused on love and in doing speak so eloquently to how we \\u2014 yes, that collective, humane 'we' \\u2014\\u00a0live and love, hurt and might survive.\\n\\n\\n(Note: 'Porcelain War' will be showing at the Boulder International Film Festival in late February.)\\n \\n'A New Kind of Wilderness'\\n\\n\\nWhat begins as a lovely, albeit demanding undertaking, a way for Maria and Nik to raise their four children in concert with the natural world is upended when Maria dies.

David (Eisenberg) and Benji Kaplan (Kieran Culkin) head to Poland for a heritage tour and to visit the childhood home of their deceased grandmother. There's no shortage of comedy or pathos as the two explore their Jewish roots and tangled fondness (and resentments) in this aching, incisive dramatic comedy.\\n\\n\\nSundance award: Waldo Salt Screenwriting Award\\n\\n\\nWill you be able to see It: Searchlight Pictures has it.\\n\\n\\n'Girls Will Be Girls'\\n\\n\\nDuring the post-screening Q&A, director Shukhi Talati described her frisky and frank coming-of-age gem as a love story between mother and daughter.

The upright, first female prefect of her private school, Mira is turned upside down and her mind and other parts begin to wander when she and classmate Sri (a slyly charming Kesav Binoy Kiron) fall for each other.\\n\\n\\nSundance awards: Audience Award, World Dramatic and special jury award for acting for Panigrahi\\n\\n\\nWill you be able to see it: For the time being, keep an eye on the festival circuit.\\n\\n\\nKeith Sweptson hugs five-year-old daughter Aubrey in the award-winning documentary 'Daughters.'

For 10 weeks, the men sitting in chairs along a cement block, linoleum-floored corridor have been taking a prison course in fatherhood. Now their young daughters are about to walk into that corridor for a Date with Dad dance, sponsored by a non-profit organization called Girls for Change. The guys, looking oh-so-sharp in suits and ties, fidget and crane their necks trying to get a glimpse of their little girls. Given how seldom these men are allowed in-person visits with family, the fear of 'will she recognize me?' hangs in the air.

And the notion that not all this maturing is likely to happen before the frenetic feature 'Didi' concludes is one of the things that makes writer-director Sean Wang's debut, set in Fremont, Calif., so authentic. Chris skateboards (sort of). He shoots skateboard video (sort of). He flirts (tentatively). And he lies (oh, how he lies) because he's not comfortable in his skin \\u2014 even less at ease than all the other teens itching to seem grown. Joan Chen gives a beautifully measured turn as Chris' mom, a somewhat thwarted painter whose husband lives and works in Taiwan.

      "            \"summary\": \"The reason Ryan Madsen is part of a small but growing cadre of ski bike enthusiasts on Colorado slopes isn't very complicated, and he has a ready answer for anyone who asks.\\n\\n\\n'Because,' the 46-year-old Texan says, 'I suck at skiing.'\\n\\n\\nHe's taken lessons plenty of times on his annual ski trips with family and friends, but never gotten the hang of it. When others would head for the lifts, he would find something else to do.\\n\\n\\n'They would always get up on the mountain and enjoy it,' Madsen said, 'and the rest of us would just find a bar and drink.'\\n\\n\\nThat changed three years ago at Breckenridge when Madsen noticed a business renting ski bikes and offering introductory tours. He gave one a try with a buddy and was hooked the first day.\\n\\n\\n'We spent maybe 30 minutes getting the how-to on everything,' Madsen said. 'Before we knew it, we were on a blue (run), and after that, we were on a black \\u2014 on the first day.'\\n \\nSki bikes are still only a tiny segment of the snow sports landscape, but the industry appears to be picking up some momentum. That's partly because they are proving attractive to people with knees and backs that have some mileage on them, not to mention folks who appreciate a learning curve that often proves faster than for skiing and snowboarding.\\n\\n\\nMost Colorado ski areas allow them, including all four resorts in Summit County, the four Aspen Snowmass mountains, Vail and Beaver Creek, Crested Butte, Steamboat, Copper Mountain and Winter Park. The few that ban them tend to be small or mid-sized areas such as Loveland, Monarch, Sunlight and Wolf Creek.\\n \\nSki bikes got some unwelcome publicity earlier this month when \\na ski biker struck and injured two skiers at Keystone\\n \\u2014 one of them seriously \\u2014 and fled the scene. The Summit County Sheriff found and cited a 50-year-old Louisiana man, according to news reports. The case has been sent to the Summit County DA's office.\\n\\n\\nPatrick Neelan, chairman of \\nthe American SkiBike Association\\n, said he was 'unaware of any statistics' regarding ski-bike safety as compared to skiing and snowboarding.\\n\\n\\n'Because the market share is so small, it has not been studied,' Neelan said. 'In my ski-biking career that goes back to 2007, this Keystone accident is the first time I've ever heard of someone else being injured by a ski bike.'\\n\\n\\nAdrienne Saia Isaac, spokeswoman for the Lakewood-based \\nNational Ski Areas Association\\n, says the industry welcomes ski bikers to the slopes but stresses that they have the same responsibilities under the Colorado Ski Safety Act as skiers and snowboarders.\\n\\n\\nTour guide Matt Barks, left, explains how to ride SnoGo SkiBikes at the ski resort in Winter Park on Friday, Jan. 19, 2024. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\\n\\n\\n'The rules apply to all who slide, irrespective of how you do it,' Isaac said. 'No matter what (gear) you're on, you have a responsibility to stay on scene when an accident happens like that, and to stay in control. I'm hoping that one incident doesn't tarnish the activity. If you've never been on any type of sliding equipment, we recommend you take a lesson so you can prepare yourself for riding and loading and unloading the lift safely, remaining in control, and making sure you're on the appropriate terrain for your ability level.'\\n\\n\\nKatie Englen of Arvada, 35, did just that last week at Winter Park. She is coming back from foot surgery that put her in a boot for six months, and now she's experiencing knee issues she suspects were caused by having spent so much time on crutches. She's regained enough strength to have skinned up the mountain on skis before her ski bike lesson, but she has been thinking about diversifying her winter recreation.\\n\\n\\n'I'm hoping to find something that's a little easier on the knees, for the long term,' Englen said.\\n\\n\\nWinter Park offers guided introductory and advanced ski bike tours using \\nSno-Go ski bikes\\n, a leader in the industry. The Sno-Go design is actually a trike with one ski in the front and two in the back. They have handlebars, and riders lean into turns as they would while riding bicycles. They have hooks for hauling them up the mountain on chairlifts.\\n\\n\\nEnglen took a three-hour tour last Friday and said she had a great time.\\n\\n\\n'I would definitely do it again,' Englen said. 'I'd say it's comparable to skiing, maybe a little easier. If you mountain bike, I think you're going to pick it up pretty quickly. I wanted to diversify out of skiing, so when my knees are hurting, I have something else I can do on snow.'\\n\\n\\nAlso taking the introductory class at Winter Park that day was Sharon Miller of Denver, 55. She's a former Division I basketball player who suffered a hyper-extended knee two seasons ago when she was struck by another skier who grabbed and pulled her down. She's been trying to strengthen that knee, but it's still not back to normal. After noticing increasing numbers of ski bikes on the slopes, she researched brands, bought a Sno-Go and signed up for the Winter Park tour.\\n\\n\\n'It was awesome,' Miller said. 'I would recommend that tour to anybody. I loved the low impact. And once you get the hang of it, that you're not steering the bike, that you're just leaning, it's a whole different feeling. I had so much fun, I don't think I'll get back to skiing. I think this is going to be it for me.'\\n\\n\\nIan Hunter of Denver, left, and Diego Montemayor of Phoenix, right, learn how to make turns with SnoGo SkiBike Tours at the ski resort in Winter Park on Friday, Jan. 19, 2024. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\\n\\n\\nWinter Park is home to one of 17 official Sno-Go Ride Centers around the country where people can try them out, and the only one in Colorado. Winter Park instructors conduct the tours out of the resort's \\nAdventure & Supply Co\\n, where they also offer guided uphilling, snowshoeing and scenic snowcat rides. The Sno-Go tours, introductory and advanced, last three hours and cost $99.\\n \\nSno-Go co-founder Chase Wagstaff visited last week from Utah to touch base with his Winter Park partners.\\n\\n\\n'This is our shining star,' Wagstaff said. 'Winter Park was one of our early adopters. Their numbers are dwarfing what everyone else is doing, so we're taking the model these guys are doing and going around the country, implementing that at other resorts.'\\n\\n\\nWagstaff and his co-founder, best friend Obed Marrder, started the company with a Kickstarter campaign in 2015 after tinkering for years with prototypes. Now they've taken on a major investor who owns an indoor ski area in New Jersey. An estimated 5,000 Sno-Gos have been sold, and they're manufacturing about 2,000 annually.\\n\\n\\n'We have a video that's at almost 50 million views in like three weeks,' Wagstaff said.\\n\\n\\nSki bikes come in three types\\n. Type 1 bikes have a seat, a rear ski and a front ski with handlebars for steering. Riders sit and wear foot-skis for added stability. Type 2 bikes have a rear ski, a front ski with handlebars, footrests and suspension systems. The Type 3 Sno-Go designs have three skis, one in front and two in the back.\\n\\n\\nSno-Go bikes cost between $2,000 and $3,400.\\n\\n\\n'When you lean the handlebars left and right, that's the entire learning curve,' Wagstaff said. 'All three skis are edging in parallel, which is the learning curve of skiing. You lean the bars left and right. That's how the bike carves, and that's how you stop. Your feet are shoulder-length apart. You're leaning on the bars, which gives you a lot of stability.'\\n\\n\\nYusivia Parra from Phoenix prepares to take a chair lift with SnoGo SkiBike Tours at the ski resort in Winter Park on Friday, Jan. 19, 2024. (Photo by Hyoung Chang/The Denver Post)\\n\\n\\nSki bike rentals are available through companies such as \\nColorado Ski Bikes\\n and \\nGo Enjoy Outdoors\\n, which deliver rentals by reservation. Colorado Ski Bikes delivers Type 2 bikes to most Front Range resorts and several others in the state. Go Enjoy Outdoors delivers Sno-Go tikes in the Denver area and Winter Park.\\n\\n\\n'About half the week, we'll do rentals and services out of the Denver and Boulder area,' said Emma Hazley, who owns Go Enjoy Outdoors with her husband, Garrett. 'On the weekends, we're based out of Winter Park and Fraser. We'll meet them on the way to the mountains, on the way home from the mountains.'\\n\\n\\nSki bikes also are popular in adaptive programs, including Winter Park's \\nNational Sports Center for the Disabled\\n. Roger Black, who helps run Winter Park's tours, had a man in his 50s last year who had been a lifelong skier before developing Parkinson's Disease.\\n\\n\\n'It basically took skiing away from him,' Black said. 'It affected his left leg; it was really shaky, and he couldn't put a ton of weight on it. He came out and signed up for the entry tour. It took him a little extra time, like half an hour more (to learn). He eventually loved it. I saw him the next week at Steamboat with his own purchased Sno-Go, having the time of his life, so happy to be able to get out and glide around on the mountain again.'\",\n",

They include Paris, Iceland, Jamaica, Costa Rica, Cleveland, Arizona, Black Canyon of the Gunnison, Banff, Tokyo, Ireland, Hatch, New Mexico, New York City, Mexico City, Puerto Rico, Hawaii Big Island, Glenwood Springs, Asheville North Carolina, the Mountain Plover Festival, Amache, Camp Hall, Mount Blue Sky and Boulder.\",\n",
      "            \"summary\": \"Every year, The New York Times publishes a list titled '52 Places to Go,' and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming. But most of those far-flung locales are bucket-listers, the kinds of destinations that make for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or a special adventure.\\n\\nSo we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024, but with more manageable goals \\u2014 and with a nod toward Colorado connections. We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport, because travel is already difficult these days \\u2014 prices, crowds, cancellations. Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nBon voyage.\\n\\nIN COLORADO\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of , Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft beer highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated driver and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which \\u2014 like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei \\u2014 are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range \\u2014 at any time of year, really \\u2014 in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore \\u2014 and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nSpring training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s \\u2014 a nice break from cold Colorado weather \\u2014 and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, N.M.\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so you can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, N.C.\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, N.C., in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25\\u2013June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings \\u2014 which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating the eclipse with ranger-led activities. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but  \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to The Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Earth's \\nmoon\\n is a constant in the night sky, following predictable \\nphases in its orbit\\n. However, its size likely has been changing over time. A \\nstudy published January 25 in the\\n Planetary Science Journal\\n found that the moon has shrunk more than 150 feet in circumference as its core gradually cooled over the past few hundred million years.\\u00a0\\n \\n[Related: \\nThe moon is 40 million years older than we thought, according to crystals collected by Apollo astronauts\\n.]\\n \\nA team of scientists from NASA, the Smithsonian, Arizona State University, and The University of Maryland discovered evidence that the continuing shrinkage led to some surface changes around the Lunar South Pole. The terrain has even changed in areas where NASA hopes to land during the \\ncrewed Artemis III mission\\n.\\u00a0\\n \\nThis lunar shrinking process looks similar to how a \\ngrape wrinkles when it becomes a raisin\\n. The moon also wrinkles and creases as it shrinks down. However, a grape has a flexible skin, while the moon has a brittle surface. The brittleness causes faults to form where sections of the crust push up against each other.\\n \\nThe fault formation caused by this continued shrinking often comes with \\nseismic activity like moonquakes\\n. Any locations near these moon fault zones could pose a threat to human exploration there, the same way that those \\nliving near fault lines on Earth\\n face a greater risk of earthquakes.\\u00a0\\n \\nThe epicenter of one of the strongest moonquakes recorded by the Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment was located in the lunar south polar region. However, the exact location of the epicenter could not be accurately determined. A cloud of possible locations (magenta dots and light blue polygon) of the strong shallow moonquake using a relocation algorithm specifically adapted for very sparse seismic networks are distributed near the pole. Blue boxes show the locations of proposed Artemis III landing regions. Lobate thrust fault scarps are shown by small red lines. The cloud of epicenter locations encompasses a number of lobate scarps and many of the Artemis III landing regions. CREDIT: NASA/LRO/LROC/ASU/Smithsonian Institution.\\n \\nIn the \\nnew study\\n, the team linked a group of faults in the moon's south polar region to a powerful \\nmoonquake recorded by Apollo seismometers over 50 years ago\\n. They used computer models to simulate the stability of surface slopes here and found that some areas in particular were vulnerable to lunar landslides from the seismic activity.\\n \\n'Our modeling suggests that shallow moonquakes capable of producing strong ground shaking in the south polar region are possible from slip events on existing faults or the formation of new thrust faults,' Thomas R. Watters, study co-author and senior scientist emeritus in the National Air and Space Museum, \\nsaid in a statement\\n. 'The global distribution of young thrust faults, their potential to be active and the potential to form new thrust faults from ongoing global contraction should be considered when planning the location and stability of permanent outposts on the moon.'\\n \\nShallow moonquakes occur only \\nabout 100 or so miles deep into the moon's crust\\n. They are caused by faults and can be strong enough to damage equipment and human-made structures. Earthquakes tend to last for only a few seconds or minutes at most. Shallow \\nmoonquakes can last for hours and even a whole afternoon\\n. The team connected the magnitude 5 moonquake recorded by the \\nApollo Passive Seismic Network\\n in the 1970s\\u00a0 to a group of faults detected by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter more recently. This means that this seismic activity could devastate any future hypothetical settlements on the moon.\\u00a0\\n \\n[Related: \\n10 incredible lunar missions that paved the way for Artemis\\n.]\\n \\n'You can think of the moon's surface as being dry, grounded gravel and dust. Over billions of years, the surface has been hit by asteroids and comets, with the resulting angular fragments constantly getting ejected from the impacts,' study co-author and University of Maryland geologist Nicholas Schmerr, \\nsaid in a statement\\n. 'As a result, the reworked surface material can be micron-sized to boulder-sized, but all very loosely consolidated. Loose sediments make it very possible for shaking and landslides to occur.'\\n \\nLunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera (LROC), Narrow Angle Camera (NAC) mosaic of the Wiechert cluster of lobate scarps (left pointing arrows) near the lunar south pole.

CREDIT: NASA/LRO/LROC/ASU/Smithsonian Institution.\\n \\nThe team will continue to map out this seismic activity on the moon, hoping to pinpoint more locations that could be dangerous for human exploration. NASA's Artemis missions are currently scheduled to launch their first crewed flight in \\nSeptember 2025\\n, with a crewed moon landing scheduled for \\nSeptember 2026\\n. One of the ultimate goals of these future missions is a long-term human presence on the moon.\\n \\n'As we get closer to the crewed Artemis mission's launch date, it's important to keep our astronauts, our equipment and infrastructure as safe as possible,' Schmerr said. 'This work is helping us prepare for what awaits us on the moon\\u2014whether that's engineering structures that can better withstand lunar seismic activity or protecting people from really dangerous zones.'\",\n",

Voting is also different than it was before the 2020 hiatus, with prior winners (a group that skews white, and male) no longer being automatically included in the voting body that determined who moved from the semifinalist to the finalist list below (and from there, who wins). The voting body has also expanded beyond traditional food media. The stated goal in the 2021 audit was also to have at least 50 percent of committee members and judges be people of color by the 2023 awards.\\n\\nThis 'long list' reflects only the restaurant and chef categories; finalists in these categories will be announced on April 3 and winners will be revealed at a gala ceremony in Chicago on June 10.

      "            \"summary\": \"Pickleball in paradise.\\n\\nIt's not a Jimmy Buffett song \\u2014 it's the concept behind the newly opened indoor pickleball facility in Lincoln Park where palm fronds and cabanas flank eight indoor courts.\\n\\nIt's called SPF (short for Social, Pickleball and Fun \\u2014 but also sunscreen) and located at 2121 N. Clybourn Ave.\\n\\n'We wanted to create an experience that went beyond just pickleball and gave people that getaway vibe,' said co-owner Rich Green, 42.\\n\\nPingpong tables, shuffleboard, Pop-a-Shot, air hockey, cornhole and 'glow in the dark' pickleball under a black light are a few of the options available in the 42,000-square-foot space that previously housed Brooklyn Boulders, an indoor climbing facility.\\n\\nA cafe counter near the entrance offers sandwiches, salads and coffee. A full bar is nearby. Slushy drinks can be ordered to cabanas via QR code. And a full kitchen is slated to open later this year in partnership with the folks behind Honey Butter Fried Chicken that will offer something akin to a 'surf shack' menu.\\n\\nBut perhaps the most appealing aspect for picklers: They won't have to compete for court time with tennis players \\u2014 a common source of friction that's plagued the pickleball community in Chicago as players seek out public spaces (mostly tennis courts) that double as pickleball courts.\\n\\n'We don't get the glares from the tennis people. It's ours. This is ours,' Antigone Polite, 60, a scientist from Lincoln Park, said during a break from a pickle game at SPF.\\n\\n'We knew there was this pent-up demand for the indoor pickle experience in the city, so we wanted to deliver the eight courts in winter as quickly as we could,' Green said, noting that a ninth court will be added in the coming weeks, as will more cabanas.\\n\\nNo membership is required.\\n\\nOpen play \\u2014 the sports equivalent of pickup basketball \\u2014 is offered for $8 or $10 an hour, depending on whether it's during peak or off-peak hours. Courts can also be reserved for $40 or $60 an hour.\\n\\nSPF has a membership program for $59 a month \\u2014 or $599 for the year \\u2014 that offers priority reservations, use of locker rooms and saunas, and discounts on food and drinks. Membership will be capped at 500, and nearly 475 people had already signed up, Green said.\\n\\n'It can't get better than this place,' said Sarah Rynbrandt, 33, a vascular ultrasound technician from Roscoe Village who plays pickleball 10 times a week \\u2014 a not uncommon amount among legions of hardcore picklers.\\n\\n'This is just spectacular. Phenomenal,' said Ed Barnett, 87, of Lincoln Park, who plays three times a week. He normally plays during warm-weather months at Mandrake Park, 3858 S. Cottage Grove Ave., or Fosco Park, 1312 S. Racine Ave.\\n\\nDuring winter, many picklers play in the gymnasiums of Chicago Park District field houses, but the wood surface isn't ideal, they say.\\n\\nCourts at SPF are made with a material used by the Professional Pickleball Association, which provides better bounce and a bit of cushion that's easier on the joints, Green said.\\n\\nThe noise from pickleball (the whack of a racket on a hollow ball) can be a nuisance to neighbors in public spaces, but is confined to the SPF building. Measures were even taken to soften the acoustics so people hanging out courtside can comfortably chat, Green said.\\n\\nA total of 170 parking spaces are available for customers. And professional players are on hand to teach lessons.\\n\\nAn introductory program for kids has been dubbed the Cucumber Club. Parents can inconspicuously watch from a balcony viewing area.\\n\\nGreen, who lives less than a block away from SPF and has a background in real estate law, had a eureka moment while playing pickleball with his wife, Lisa Rella, at a facility in Fort Worth, Texas, that offered ambiance, food and play.\\n\\n'Next to us was a grandmother playing with her grandkid, and a bachelorette party was playing next to us on other side, and we were like, \\u2018What kind of concept is doing this... bringing so many types of people into a facility, and they're all all having the best times of their lives ,and everyone is interacting in some way?' ' Green said.\\n\\nHe pitched the idea to two friends from his days at Duke University, who ultimately signed on as co-owners.\\n\\nOne was David Galst, who has a background creating 'experiential fun houses,' like Luna Park, an amusement park on Coney Island. The other is Chris Boston, who has experience in construction and finance.\\n\\nBoth live in New York but have been frequent visitors to Chicago in recent months as they prepared SPF for opening.\\n\\nBefore greenlighting the project, Green checked out pickleball locations on two road trips \\u2014 one along the Eastern Seaboard, the other across the Midwest \\u2014 with his 10-year-old son tagging along.\\n\\nAnother detail that factored into the decision: Chicago has been way behind the rest of the country in building courts to accommodate what's been widely hailed as the fastest-growing sport in the country.\\n\\nThe park district offers more than 100 pickleball courts at about 40 parks and field house gymns.\\n\\nA few private businesses in the city operate courts, like Big City Pickle and the School House. And several private fitness clubs do also, but nothing is comparable to what SPF brings to Chicago.\\n\\n'We saw the public data on the shortage of courts . . . and there are still so many people who haven't even been exposed to the game. Why is Chicago so behind? I don't know; it doesn't make any sense,' Green said.\",\n",

'She was also humble and self-deprecating, which only made her more endearing.' \\nLast Thanksgiving, Michael Sheahan, Ms. Sheahan's grandfather and former Cook County sheriff, drove her to catch a train back to Ann Arbor.\\nMichael Sheahan, who has 21 grandchildren, said 'it wasn't easy to spend individual time with each one,' but he cherished the time he spent with Ms. Sheahan as they spoke about her life and waited for the train. \\n'She was at a great point in her life,' said Michael Sheahan, known as 'Pops' among family members. 'It is so sad, it was cut short, but her smile and laughter will be remembered by her family and friends forever.' \\n \\nMs. Sheahan enjoyed cooking, laughing and traveling. She spent a semester studying in Barcelona, Spain.\\n'Eileen had the most profound effect on those around her during her short time on earth,' Patti and T.J. Sheahan, Ms. Sheahan's parents, wrote in her obituary. 'She was graceful, kind, hilarious, beautiful and brilliant.'\\n \\n'We feel blessed to have had 22 beautiful years with our cherished daughter and comforted at this time to feel her presence and love all around us,' Ms. Sheahan's parents added in a later statement. \\nVisitation for Ms. Sheahan will be 2 to 8 p.m. Sunday at the Donnellan Family Funeral Home in Skokie. A Mass is planned for 10:30 a.m. Monday at Old Saint Patrick's Church in the West Loop.\\n \\nIn lieu of flowers, donations may be made to The Eileen Sheahan Memorial Scholarship at The Academy at St. Joan of Arc or Loyola Academy, her family said. \\nIn addition to her parents, brother, aunt and grandfather, Ms. Sheahan is survived by her sisters, Erin and Margaret; grandmother, Nancy; and many cousins, uncles, aunts, relatives and friends. \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nEileen Sheahan kneels next to Biscuit, the family dog.\",\n",

The symbolic resolution was approved by a divided City Council at a raucous meeting that, once again, forced Mayor Brandon Johnson to cast the tie-breaking vote.\\n\\nWhat the resolution says: 'We, the Chicago City Council, do hereby call for a permanent ceasefire to end the ongoing violence in Gaza; call for humanitarian assistance including medicine food and water to be sent into the impacted region and the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.'\\n\\nMayor broke the tie: Johnson helped to deliver the 24 to 23 vote by personally lobbying fence-sitting alderpersons on behalf of the resolution championed by Ald. Rosanna Rodriguez Sanchez, the Council's Human Relations Committee Chair.\\n\\nA contentious meeting: Johnson was forced to clear the Council chambers as alderpersons debated the resolution for hours amid cheers and jeers from cease-fire supporters, who ignored the mayor's pleas to 'demonstrate some restraint.'\\n\\nFormer City Hall insider sentenced: William 'Billy' Mahon, a former high-ranking aide to three Chicago mayors, was sentenced Wednesday to 18 months in prison and fined $75,000 for his role in the collapse of a crooked Bridgeport bank with ties to the Daley family and its political organization.\\nTrump and Illinois' ballot: A bid to block former President Donald Trump from Illinois' March 19 primary ballot has moved to state court, where challengers to the likely 2024 Republican nominee are hoping to move quickly in a case expected to make its way to the state's Supreme Court.\\nDecision on police disciplinary ruling punted: Mayor Johnson's City Council allies Wednesday put off a vote on whether to reject an arbitrator's ruling that would allow police officers recommended for firings or suspensions to bypass the Police Board in favor of an arbitrator who would hold proceedings behind closed doors. They left the decision to a Cook County judge.\\nSenate confirms 7th Circuit judge: The U.S. Senate on Tuesday confirmed Joshua Kolar, a federal magistrate and a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy Reserve, to a spot on the Chicago-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 7th Circuit.\\nHow much is Arlington Park worth? The Chicago Bears and three northwest suburban school districts are still far apart \\u2014 $100 million to be exact \\u2014 on their valuation of the former Arlington International Racecourse, the potential site of a new team stadium.\\nHot dog stand relishes new chapter: A new hot dog stand, called Modern Relish, has opened at the site where Duk's Red Hots became a West Town staple for nearly 70 years. But that doesn't mean you won't still find some familiar faces there.\\n4 stars for \\u2018Masters of the Air': Callum Turner and Austin Butler play U.S. airmen in this epic production with modern effects but old-fashioned spirit, writes Sun-Times critic Richard Roeper.\\n\\n\\n\\nReporting by Mitch Dudek\\n\\nPickleball in paradise. It's not a Jimmy Buffett song \\u2014 it's the concept behind the newly opened indoor pickleball facility in Lincoln Park where palm fronds and cabanas flank eight indoor courts.\\n\\nIt's called SPF (short for Social, Pickleball and Fun \\u2014 but also sunscreen) and located at 2121 N. Clybourn Ave.\\n\\n'We wanted to create an experience that went beyond just pickleball and gave people that getaway vibe,' said co-owner Rich Green, 42.\\n\\nPingpong tables, shuffleboard, Pop-a-Shot, air hockey, cornhole and 'glow in the dark' pickleball under a black light are a few of the options available in the 42,000-square-foot space that previously housed Brooklyn Boulders, an indoor climbing facility.\\n\\nA cafe counter near the entrance offers sandwiches, salads and coffee. A full bar is nearby. Slushy drinks can be ordered to cabanas via QR code. And a full kitchen is slated to open later this year.\\n\\nBut perhaps the most appealing aspect for picklers: They won't have to compete for court time with tennis players \\u2014 a common source of friction that's plagued the pickleball community in Chicago as players seek out public spaces (mostly tennis courts) that double as pickleball courts.\\n\\nAnd no membership is required, though it's available for $59 a month or $599 for the year.\\n\\n\\u2018Illinoise' team puts dancers up front in adapting Sufjan Stevens' album for stage\\n\\nReporting by Courtney Kueppers | WBEZ\\n\\nZombies, UFOs and sweet youthful discovery all set to a soaring, orchestral score. Sufjan Stevens' seminal 2005 album 'Illinois' is imbued with stories that seem tailor-made for the stage.\\n\\nOr at least choreographer Justin Peck thought so. Stevens, it turns out, wasn't immediately on board. Peck lobbied the Detroit-born musician for years before Stevens gave the green light to adapt the album into something new.\\n\\n'It took me about five years to get him to give in and say, \\u2018If you're really serious about this and you want to do something with it, go ahead,'' Peck recalled. That was in 2019, which was followed by a long gestation period, when the 36-year-old dancer-turned choreographer-turned-director explored a central question: What would a second life for a beloved album look like?\\n\\nNow, Peck is leading the charge on that something new: a dance-forward musical called 'Illinoise' that, like the album that inspired it, attempts to bend genres. Defying categorization, it draws audiences into a fantasy world that is not exactly musical theater, nor a full-length dance work. It is neither \\u2014 and both: an 'exciting, singular event,' as Rick Boynton, the creative producer at the Chicago Shakespeare Theater puts it.\\n\\nOn Saturday, the show, which had a quiet staging last year at Bard College in New York, will officially open in Chicago, complete with a first exposure to media reviews, before heading to the Park Avenue Armory in New York, and the team hopes, other high-profile stages beyond that.\\n\\nDo you think there's beef between tennis and pickleball players in Chicago?

They have remained in jail since. James Crumbley's trial opens on March 5.\\nWhen the charges were announced, prosecutors said the Crumbley's failure to both secure the gun in their home and to respond to warnings that their son, Ethan, was violent and disturbed, justified the charges they face.\\nDefense attorneys have said in court documents that the Crumbleys had no way of knowing their son was going to carry out the shooting.\\nLegal experts have said that the parents' trial, which appears to be the first of its kind, breaks new legal ground.\\nJosh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, said school shooter's parents are often not held to account because of feelings that \\\"they've been through enough\\\" or because of lax enforcement of such measures as safe storage laws.\\nHolding more parents responsible when appropriate is an important step, Horwitz said, given that studies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have shown that around 75% of all school shooters obtained their weapons in the home.\\n\\\"Rarely are high school shooters going out and buying guns from a gun store,\\\" Horwitz said. \\\"The broader lesson from this case is that every parent who is a gun owner has a role to play, and that's the secure and safe storage of firearms.\\\"\\nPREVENTABLE TRAGEDY\\nFour days before the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.\\nMichigan law prohibits those under 18 years of age from buying or possessing firearms, except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult.\\nEthan posted photos of the gun on social media, writing, \\\"Just got my new beauty today\\\" and adding a heart emoji. The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range \\\"testing out his new Christmas present,\\\" Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said when she announced charges against the parents.\\nThe day before the shooting at the school near Detroit, a teacher found Ethan Crumbley using his smart phone to search for ammunition and alerted school officials. The officials left messages for his mother that went unreturned. His mother later texted him, \\\"LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.\\\"\\nOn the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words \\\"Blood everywhere,\\\" \\\"My life is useless,\\\" and \\\"The thoughts won't stop - help me.\\\"\\nEthan told school counselors the drawings were for a video game he was designing, school officials have said.\\nThe Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.\\nEthan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.\\n\\\"This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter's parents hadn't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the shooter, or if his parents had taken basic steps to securely store the gun,\\\" said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of Law and Policy at the anti-gun violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. \\\"They should be held accountable.\\\" (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; editing by Donna Bryson and Michael Perry)\",\n",

They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n \\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Guttridge, farmer and co-owner at Ollin Farms, feeds the chickens. The farm benefits from a county program that helps small growers get their produce to more people.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n \\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n \\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n \\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2013 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2013 many of mixed immigration status \\u2013 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \\n \\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n \\nWin, win, win\\n \\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \\n \\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains. \\n \\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \\n \\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n \\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \\n \\nA force for good\\n \\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n \\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n \\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n \\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \\n \\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n \\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2013 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.\\n \\nPhotography by Rachel Woolf.

Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nBon voyage.\\n\\nIN COLORADO\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of , Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft beer highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated driver and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which \\u2014 like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei \\u2014 are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range \\u2014 at any time of year, really \\u2014 in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore \\u2014 and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nSpring training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s \\u2014 a nice break from cold Colorado weather \\u2014 and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, N.M.\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so you can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, N.C.\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, N.C., in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25\\u2013June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings \\u2014 which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating the eclipse with ranger-led activities. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but  \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to The Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (\\nor the path of 'totality'\\n), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called \\nCuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating\\n. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but \\n\\n \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\n\\nThe Olympic Games are coming to Paris this summer. (AP Photo/Francois Mori, File)\\n\\n\\nParis\\n\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. \\nAir France has been flying direct from DIA\\n in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, \\nis set to reopen in December 2024\\n.\\n\\n\\nDublin\\n\\n\\nFor being the \\nsixth-busiest airport in the entire world\\n, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\n\\nVisitors to Iceland's Blue Lagoon spa swim in pools of milky-blue, 99-degree geothermal waters.\\n\\n\\nIceland\\n\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since \\nthey are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis\\n, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and \\na magical group of rockabilly street performers\\n.\\n\\n\\nMorning at Jakes in Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth, Jamaica. (Provided by Jakes hotel)\\n\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' \\nas we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital\\n. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. \\nRead more about this sunny destination\\n \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become \\na hot travel destination in the past decade\\n, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\n\\nA vendor sells coconut drinks at a beach at Manuel Antonio in Costa Rica. (Evelyne Horovitz, The Washington Post)\\n\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but \\nCosta Rica has been particularly popular\\n recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado.

      "            \"summary\": \"From The Denver Post\\n\\nDENVER\\u2014Every year, The New York Times publishes a list titled '52 Places to Go,' and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming. But most of those far-flung locales are bucket-listers, the kinds of destinations that make for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or a special adventure.\\n\\nSo we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024, but with more manageable goals\\u2014and with a nod toward Colorado connections. We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport, because travel is already difficult these days\\u2014prices, crowds, cancellations. Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft Beer Highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which\\u2014like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei\\u2014are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest 14\\u2018er to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado 14'ers that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range\\u2014at any time of year, really\\u2014in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore\\u2014and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIn The United States\\n\\nSpring Training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s\\u2014a nice break from cold Colorado weather\\u2014and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Joe Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, New Mexico\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so you can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, North Carolina\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, North Caroline, in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25 to June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings\\u2014which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\nThe Big Island\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but The Big Island\\u2014and Hapuna Beach\\u2014might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOverseas\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years\\u2014and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island nation has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or northern lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis\\u2014and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination\\u2014along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture\\u2014in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly.

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, had called on Ziegler to resign in November. \\n The Sarasota police said on Friday that Ziegler had used his cellphone to record the sexual encounter during which the alleged rape occurred.\\n \\\"The video showed that the encounter was likely consensual,\\\" police said. \\\"Therefore, detectives were unable to develop probable cause to charge Ziegler with sexual battery.\\\" \\n Ziegler's accuser, however, told police she did not know she was being filmed, leading them to file a \\\"probable cause affidavit for the felony crime of Video Voyeurism against Christian Ziegler,\\\" the statement said. \\n The scandal has also embroiled Ziegler's wife, Bridget, a Sarasota School Board member who co-founded the conservative parents-rights group Moms for Liberty and has advocated against teaching young children about gender and sexuality issues.\\n No criminal accusations have been lodged against her.\\n (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; Editing by Edmund Klamann)\\n By Brad Brooks\",\n",

      "            \"excerpt\": \"This prime cut of bovine bud surpassed expectations from jar to ash.\",\n",
      "            \"summary\": \"A nice steak is often expensive, but nothing comes close to wagyu. Marbled with vast spiderwebs of tender fat and raised in Japan under relatively cushy circumstances, true wagyu costs more than some paychecks, especially if it's A5 grade, the highest score for Japanese wagyu. That's the real top shelf.\\n\\n\\nI can barely afford a few thin slices of wagyu sashimi in Denver, let alone a full ribeye. This is usually when I'm grateful for finding a weed variety of the same name that's much cheaper, but I had to wait until payday to buy an eighth of A5 Wagyu from \\nGreen Dot Labs\\n, too. Given the Boulder cultivation's sterling reputation for bringing the heat, though, I knew that this steak had enough sizzle and substance to satisfy. \\n Green Dot mixed in-house cuts of Downshift and Candy Cake to breed this prime cut of bovine bud, which surpassed\\u00a0my expectations from jar to ash. This A5 was an A10, thanks to a meaty aroma and an incredibly potent high guaranteed to surprise anyone who tries it for the first time, no matter their tolerance. In fact, A5 Wagyu is so powerful that I wouldn't recommend it as an all-day strain, because most people are destined for the dunce corner after their second hit.\\n\\n\\nThen again, wagyu steaks aren't meant to be marinated, grilled or even eaten on a weekly basis. They're too rich to approach like any other steak, and the same goes for this beast of a \\nsavory strain\\n. I puff like a coal plant in the '70s, and one bong rip of A5 Wagyu sends my brain to slaughter. Once I knew what to expect, though, A5 Wagyu became one of my favorite Green Dot creations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLooks: \\nJust like heavy marbling, trichome coverage on A5 Wagyu is so thick that your eyes might miss the purple hues and subtle blue spots underneath that white coat. The gnarled, dolloped buds are denser than they look, and their shape adds to the intimidation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmell: \\nDon't let Green Dots' description of \\\"fatty, savory gas\\\" scare you away. That might sound like a bad post-burrito experience, but opening a jar of A5 Wagyu showcases a sweet, rubbery funk that longtime cannabis lovers go crazy for, with a zesty onion blanket and buttery finish. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlavor: \\nA5 Wagyu's savory notes of garlic and onion play well with a dominant gassy funk, both of which stick to my cheeks as fatty, nutty flavors jump around my tongue. The combination creates a strong aftertaste.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffects: \\nA little A5 Wagyu goes a long way. I don't need a full bong rip to visit new dimensions, and that's barely hyperbole. This is a visual, almost psychedelic high that starts in the brain and works downward. While it leaves enough energy for something, I'm usually too stoned to know what that something might be before inevitably turning into dust on my couch. Unless you want to sit under a tree or look at the clouds, keep this one indoors. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere to find it: \\nWe've spotted this Green Dot exclusive in flower or extracted form at A Cut Above, Allgreens, Berkeley Dispensary, Best High, Boulder Wellness, Callie's Cannabis Shoppe, the Cannabis Depot, Chronic Therapy, Colorado Harvest Company, Del Mundo Cannabis, Den-Rec, Denver Kush Club, the Dispensary Littleton, Doc's Apothecary, Eclipse Cannabis Company,\\u00a0 Elevated Longmont, the Farm, Golden Meds, Green Dragon, Green Valley Dispensary, Greenfields, the Green Solution, High Level Health, Higher Grade, Karing Kind, Kind Love, Lakeshore Cannabis, Life Flower Dispensary, Lightshade, Lova, Magnolia Road Cannabis Co., Maikoh Holistics, Medicine Man, Native Roots, Nature's Kiss, Oasis Cannabis Superstores, Peak, Potco, Pure Dispensary, Reefer Madness, RiNo Supply Co., Rocky Road, Simply Pure, Skunked, Snaxland, Social Cannabis, Solace Meds, Spark, Standing Akimbo, Star Buds, Unity Road and Xclusive Cannabis, but more stores likely carry it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Is there a strain you'd like to see profiled?

Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nIn a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays.\\n\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\\n\\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. \\u2014 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.\\n\\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.\\n\\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago.\\n\\nMark Guttridge, farmer and co-owner at Ollin Farms, feeds the chickens. The farm benefits from a county program that helps small growers get their produce to more people. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level.\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n\\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n\\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n\\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n\\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2014 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n\\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health.\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2014 many of mixed immigration status \\u2014 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand.\\n\\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\\n\\nRelated: Oregon's \\u014dkta restaurant takes farm-to-table one step further\\n\\nWin, win, win\\n\\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill.\\n\\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains.\\n\\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n\\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right.\\n\\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n\\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach.\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition.\\n\\n\\n\\nA force for good\\n\\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n\\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n\\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n\\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n\\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people.\\n\\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n\\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2014 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.\\n\\nCopyright 2024 NPR.

For example, global consulting firm Bain and Co. leased 39K SF at 675 15th St. and Booyah Advertising leased 25K SF at 1700 Lincoln St., according to DDP's \\n2023 State of Downtown Denver report\\n.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nDigital ad company\\u00a0\\nChoozle announced last week\\n\\u00a0that it would move its headquarters to downtown Denver as well, choosing 1125 17th St. as its new home.

River North has more than 787K SF under construction, with 92% of that captured in three projects, according to CBRE's market report. One of the projects is T3 River North, a 230K SF office building at 3500 Blake St., which is already 100% pre-leased to Xcel Energy.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nCherry Creek has more than 350K SF of office space under construction and is one of Denver's most competitive submarkets for office space. Cherry Creek boasts a 7.5% direct vacancy rate, the second lowest in the metro area behind only Longmont, and an average asking rent of $37.37 per SF, $4.52 above average for the metro area.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nJLL Managing Director and office landlord broker Jamie Roupp told \\nBisnow\\n he is targeting tenants that are 'proactively trying to attract and retain talent, particularly those with stated return-to-office policies.' Some landlords are also offering enhanced tenant improvements like new flooring or HVAC systems to attract new tenants, Roupp added.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nBut the flight to quality across the commercial real estate industry has 'widened the performance gap' for many of downtown Denver's office buildings, Roupp said, adding that newly constructed buildings that are well-located are 'capturing a disproportionate share of tenant demand.'\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nBisnow \\npreviously reported\\n that the market for Class-A office spaces is tightening in top-dollar markets like Miami, New York, and Chicago as tenants pursue space in the most modern buildings. In the short term, Roupp said these issues could buoy leasing activity at existing office spaces by delaying the delivery of new construction and controlling the pace of new supply hitting the market.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nCushman & Wakefield's data suggests that this activity is likely to persist given that Class-A office buildings contributed more than two-thirds of Denver's office leasing activity in Q4, or roughly 867.9K SF of space in all. Class-B office space made up 28.5% of activity, accounting for about 365K SF.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\nThe flight to quality has also caused existing tenant requirements and new-to-market relocations to be either flat or declining, Roupp said. He noted that this trend could reverse as demand picks up in the market, but that remains to be seen.\",\n",

The 16,000-square-foot all-day food hall will feature eight dining concepts, three retail spaces, an indoor/outdoor bar, indoor/outdoor seating, an expansive patio and event space for up to 40. 'There's nothing like this in Longmont,' said Chris Nehls, vice president of Blackfox Parkway Associates, the company that has owned the building for more than 30 years. 'Though Denver has one of the highest rates of food halls in the country, Longmont has been left out of the fun, until now. We are excited to introduce an elevated go-to space for families, couples, friends and colleagues to spend time together. Beyond the delicious food and drinks, we are making sure that every day offers a new reason to visit, from live music to pop-ups and other special events.' \\n The eight chef-driven vendors will include sushi and ramen offerings, pizza, tacos, barbecue, chicken sandwiches and more, to be operated in the kitchens that Parkway has designed and built out. There will also be a coffee shop that opens at 7 a.m., and an expansive bar with a full wine, beer and cocktail list. Award-winning \\nChile con Quesadilla\\n from Denver (Top Taco Denver winner in 2021 and 2022,) has already signed on, with interest from other popular regional concepts.\\n \\\"Once we were introduced to the idea of Parkway Food Hall, we immediately fell in love with the concept, and we loved the affordability and flexibility of the way the leases are set up, allowing more chefs to have a seat at the table,' said Christina Richardson, chef and co-owner of Chile con Quesadilla. 'As the most award-winning food truck in the state, we're thrilled to have the chance to open a more permanent spot.\\\" Parkway will open in Longmont's Parkway Promenade, one of the city's most historic shopping centers. The principal architect, Meridian 105, is the design mastermind behind Avanti Food & Beverage and Edgewater Public Market. Seasoned food hall veterans National Food Hall Solutions, the operating partner, opened Denver's Junction Food & Drink in 2020, which went on to win the NAIOP's 2020 Retail Development of the Year Award. Construction is led by Faurot Construction. 'We're excited to bring this new destination to Longmont residents and visitors, and we're thrilled to help eight local chefs and restaurateurs achieve success, whether it's through testing a new concept, creating their first brick-and-mortar following food truck success, or setting up a second, third or fourth location,' said National Food Hall Solutions Owner Pat Garza. 'Things are tough for restaurateurs these days, but we're living in a new era where the more expensive traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants aren't the only route to success for chefs.'

Food banks, domestic violence shelters, and workforce development agencies, along with schools and libraries, are just some of the organizations using Mobile Citizen to supply this vital service to their clients and staff.'\\n \\nAffordable Internet access continues to be an issue of millions of Americans.

He is an angry, volatile, unpredictable and overreactive man.\\n\\nHe has cut dozens of people out of his life when he perceives an offense \\u2014 often over ridiculous things.\\n\\nWhenever I have called him on it, he only digs in. He has NEVER apologized to me or anyone else. Never.\\n\\nI have always said that if he ever cuts any of our children out of his life, I am out of here.\\n\\nWell, he blew up at my daughter-in-law and said some horrible things. The result: My husband and son have not spoken to each other for over a year. He has not seen the grandchildren. My heart is broken.\\n\\nI have talked to counselors, friends, and priests about it.\\n\\nEveryone asks me if I am safe. He has never been violent with me, but his words hurt more than anything.\\n\\nI know that my husband needs help, but I cannot make him get it. I am so sad.

You have good relationships with your children. Your friendships are active and intact. I assume that if you approached almost anyone in your circle and asked if you could stay with them while you work on your own next steps, they would be happy to offer you temporary housing (and possibly be relieved for you).\\n\\nIf you don't want to divorce your husband because of issues related to your faith practice or your combined finances, then stay legally married and treat him with compassion by telling him, 'I wish the best for you. I invite you to the table, but I will only live with you if you are willing to make some big changes for the sake of our family.'\\n\\nBefore making any longer-term moves, it is vital that you receive professional legal and financial advice concerning your property, your finances, and future.\\n\\nDear Amy:\\n\\nMy ex-husband and I have been divorced for five years. We both have other partners. We share custody with our two children and successfully co-parent.\\n\\nThe only problem I have with him is when he insists on showing up at our kids' soccer and softball games (sometimes with his girlfriend), on the days when I have custody.\\n\\nIn my opinion, these days when I have custody are for me to share with my children, and he should respect that.\\n\\nWhat do you think?\\n\\n\\u2014 Stressed\\n\\nDear Stressed:\\n\\nLet's reframe this. Your custodial days are not for you, but for your children. The focus should be on parenting them and making sure their needs are met (to the best of your ability).\\n\\nAnd so \\u2014 wouldn't it be best for your children to have multiple people cheering them on from the sidelines? And wouldn't it be best for them to see their parents cordially getting along?\\n\\nYour co-parenting plan is not equivalent to having a restraining order. You should both show up for school events, if you are able.\\n\\nIt sounds as if you and your ex are mainly doing a good job regarding your kids.

Very few other women will 'rough it' in the wilderness like we four do.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, Ruth approached my husband and explained that they'd been avoiding more trips for the past year, as they didn't think I enjoyed the trips.\\n\\nI emailed them to offer reassurance that I do enjoy the trips \\u2013 and our friendship \\u2013 and asked them to join me for dinner to discuss this while I was home alone for a week (my husband was traveling).\\n\\nThey shut me down for any in-person interactions, saying that I project my unhappiness onto them, that they walk on eggshells around me, that I caused multiple instances of tension, and because of my 'impacts' they would remain intentionally unavailable.\\n\\nAmy, I was completely shocked! I had no idea they felt this way.\\n\\nThey put on a good mask \\u2013 for years. These people I thought were close friends shoved me aside \\u2013 by email. If they had been honest about the tension they felt, I might have been able to change my behavior, or at least understand what was bothering them.\\n\\nInstead, I am confused, grieving a friendship, and just \\u2026 really hurt.\\n\\nThey acted like 'nice people,' so this came as a shock.\\n\\nI am now questioning whether many other 'friends' dislike spending time with me, and are walking on eggshells.\\n\\nI feel social anxiety building in me.\\n\\nWhat can I do to move on and feel better about myself?\\n\\n\\u2013 Broken Eggshells\\n\\nDear Broken:\\n\\nThe one person you've left out of your narrative is your husband. He is in the best position to gauge your behavior, as well as others' reactions to you, on these trips.\\n\\nYou might have a blunt communication style that other people interpret as anger or tension. Instead of accepting, adjusting to, or rolling with your bluntness, they try to avoid it (by 'walking on eggshells').\\n\\nYour choice to contact the couple and attempt to confront this issue personally in order to clear the air is one sign of your approach to problems. While to me this seems honest, forthright and fearless \\u2013 this other couple seem to see your approach as aggressive, negative, or even hostile.\\n\\nThis current challenge presents opportunities for you to gain insight into your own behavior and its impact on others.\\n\\nI suggest that you adopt an attitude of open inquiry regarding your own behavior by surveying people who know you best and love you the most.\\n\\nYour husband and siblings (if you have them) should be able to offer you honest feedback about your interactions.\\n\\nAfter taking a clear-eyed look at your own behavior (and making changes, if need be) you then have the right to judge this other couple as being disingenuous.\\n\\nDear Amy:\\n\\nI'm a woman working as a nurse in a busy hospital.\\n\\nI have a younger colleague who at this point has a weekend shift.\\n\\nTwo or three times a month, he asks me to change shifts with him. Sometimes I say yes \\u2013 but most of the time I say no.\\n\\nLast weekend, as usual, he asked me to switch shifts with him, but I told him that I had family obligations over the weekend and couldn't do that.\\n\\nHe got really upset with me and said he was going to go to our supervisor.\\n\\nHe did, and our supervisor sided with me.\\n\\nHe now refuses to speak to me. I feel bad about it and I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing.\\n\\n\\u2013 Tired in the ER\\n\\nDear Tired:\\n\\nYour supervisor stood up for your right (and duty) to work the shifts you've been assigned. This person likely assigns shifts for specific reasons (aside from availability).\\n\\nYour co-worker was arrogant enough to take this issue to your supervisor. At this point you might be relieved that he won't speak to you \\u2013 but if this avoidance interferes with your ability to provide good patient care, your supervisor should again be told.\\n\\n  | Ask Amy: Single woman has radar for dating jerks\\n\\nAsk Amy: Single woman has radar for dating jerks  | Ask Amy: Facebook romance worries wife\\n\\nAsk Amy: Facebook romance worries wife  | Ask Amy: Married couple ponders parenthood\\n\\nAsk Amy: Married couple ponders parenthood  | Ask Amy: Blended family is not really blended\\n\\nAsk Amy: Blended family is not really blended  | Ask Amy: Sudden loss leads to other losses Dear Amy:\\n\\nI enjoyed the question from 'Tired,' who wondered how to get guests to leave at the end of an evening.\\n\\nMy grandfather had a saying that he would invoke when he got tired.\\n\\nHe would say, 'Let's go to bed now so these nice people can go home.'\\n\\n\\u2013 Lisa\\n\\nDear Lisa:\\n\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n(You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

      "            \"summary\": \"Like many, my love affair with stouts started with a draft Guinness. But in Colorado's beer mecca, local stouts reign supreme\\u2014especially during Stout Month in February, a celebration of the inkiest ales started by Boulder's Mountain Sun Pub in 1993. Gaining their dark color from heavily roasted malt (grains, usually barley), stouts tend to have a rich, coffeelike taste with a good dose of bitterness. That means they stand up well to potent flavorings, such as chocolate or warm spices, and in some cases, lactose, which gives Colorado-made classics like Left Hand's Milk Stout Nitro and Mountain Sun's Korova Cream Stout a signature creaminess and sweetness.\\n\\nIf you can't make it to one of the four Mountain Sun locations in Boulder and Longmont to play Stout Month bingo\\u2014they're tapping 24 in-house stouts over the course of the month\\u2014there's plenty of other local breweries pouring mighty dark malts. Here are five we have our eyes on this year.\\n\\nFuel your Stout Month celebrations at home with WeldWerks Brewing Co.'s Cuv\\u00e9e de Chocolatier gift box, which includes three 500-milliliter bottles of Imperial stout, all aged in bourbon/rye barrels with cacao nibs and infused with the flavors of caramel, coconut, or strawberry. Online sales for the $59 set have closed, but folks can still purchase it at WeldWerks' Greeley taproom through February 18. (Also, if you missed WeldWerks' collaboration with Our Mutual Friend Brewing, Baseglamp, a marshmallowey stout with smoked malt from Fort Collins\\u2013based Troubadour Maltings, you can still find it on draft at the latter's taproom in RiNo.)\\n\\nSpice Trade Brewery & Kitchen in Greenwood Village is known for its globally inspired beers that are often scented with heady herbs and spices. This month, the brewhouse is releasing three new stouts: a sweet Tiramisu Milk Stout, a coffee-infused 'dirty' version of its classic Chai Milk Stout, and for Valentine's Day, an Imperial golden stout inspired by red velvet cake. Stop in for dinner\\u2014the food menu is currently centered around Pan-Asian small plates\\u2014and polish your meal off with a stout for dessert.\\n\\nThose familiar with the origins of chocolate know that the Maya didn't eat it in decadent bars; they drank the stuff brewed in hot water with cinnamon and chile pepper. Luki Brewery taps into that flavor profile with the Mayan Gold Stout, which gains its subtle heat from chile de \\u00e1rbol. Sitting at 40 IBU, the beer has a bitterness that helps balance out its other sweet-leaning flavors. The Mayan Gold Stout is currently available on draft at Luki's taproom in Arvada, as well as to-go in 32-ounce crowlers.\\n\\nChad Moore and Jordan Fink of Woods Boss Brewing Company are going all in this Stout Month, with two new releases to bolster their existing lineup of dark beers. The Hisolda Irish Coffee Cream Stout is meant to taste exactly like the caffeinated cocktail: bold real-bean coffee flavor, subtle notes of whiskey, and a generous amount of lactose to emulate an Irish coffee's rich, creamy texture. If you're craving something fruitier, though, there's also the new Sakura Chocolate Cherry Stout, which uses real cherry pur\\u00e9e.\\n\\nIf you like your beers hot (i.e., high in alcohol), head to this Glendale brewery, which has been open for over five decades, for its biennial Legend of the Liquid Brain series. The bottles of bourbon-barrel-aged Imperial stout, which are available in 2019, 2021, and 2023 vintages, stand at a whopping 12 percent ABV, so it's meant for sipping, not chugging. Through Stout Month, Bull & Bush will also carry 17 other house and guest brewery stouts, so there are plenty of options for a lighter drink, too. And if you're feeling extra adventurous, order the Coffee Blueberry Stout Burger with, among a couple wacky toppings, syrup made from Bull & Bush's Stonehenge Stout.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Powder hounds found the good stuff over the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend. But for many, the freshies came at a cost: hours and hours and \\nhours\\n of delays on the way home. 'The snow was probably amazing for those who were able to get to the ski areas and then return,' says Colorado Department of Transportation (CDOT) spokesperson Elise Thatcher. 'But it's very important for travelers to factor in not just the great snow at the ski areas, but also what the roads are going to be like getting there and back.'\\n\\n\\nOr, in the case of driving conditions over the long weekend, what the parking lot conditions will be like because that's precisely what the highways became.\\n\\n\\nTurns out, when you pair accumulation that reached upward of 60 inches on some of the state's higher mountain passes with an intense rate of snowfall that peaked at around two inches an hour at times, you get a hellish driving environment. Blowing wind, low visibility, icy asphalt, near-whiteout conditions, and heavy holiday traffic all contributed to safety closures on multiple Summit County passes, Cameron Pass, and (you guessed it) I-70 eastbound on both sides of the Eisenhower-Johnson Memorial Tunnel. Jackknifed trucks and stalled-out two-wheel-drive cars created a Frogger-like driving experience (when traffic was actually moving). When it wasn't, roadsides turned into (rather drafty) bathrooms as stuck skiers did what they had to. Then there was Berthoud Pass, which was shut down by Mother Nature before CDOT had the chance. Snow slides along almost its entire length swallowed up 10 cars\\u2014no injuries were reported\\u2014and led to a four-day closure on that section of U.S. 40.\\n\\n\\nYet another factor contributing to the chaos: the paltry powder so far this season. 'When you have the weather, plus a long weekend, plus not much previous snow, people are itching to enjoy it,' says Alejandro Brown, \\nwho's been monitoring the closures (and resulting shenanigans) on I-70 since 2019\\n with his Instagram account \\n@i70things\\n. He estimates that during the MLK Day weekend, he received about five times the amount of content that he would on a typical winter weekend. 'I don't have notifications on my phone, but if I did, it would have just been nonstop.'\\n\\n\\nHis solution for mitigating the traffic madness? Simple. Follow the \\ntraction rules\\n. 'It's a few bad apples,' he says. 'What could have been their four-hour commute turns into eight or 10 hours and now everyone is frustrated and upset and grumpy.' As for skiers, they have their own solutions borne out of firsthand experience from that weekend's snowpocalypse, which they share below.\\n\\n\\nEditor's note: These interviews have been edited for length and clarity.\\n\\n\\nJudd and Nicole Nutting\\n\\n\\nTime in Colorado\\n: Judd, 30 years; Nicole, 18 years\\n\\n\\nPersonal hell\\n: Eight hours to get from Winter Park to Longmont\\n\\n\\nJudd:\\n We pulled our three kids out of school an hour early on Friday to drive up to my family's house in Winter Park for the long weekend. Of course, there was no traffic. It was barely snowing on Berthoud Pass. We didn't wake up to much snow on Saturday, so we thought, \\nOh, maybe this snowstorm isn't going to happen\\n. Sunday, we woke up and had 10 inches. Then we found out there was an avalanche on the pass that buried 10 cars.\\n\\n\\nNicole:\\n We got 16 inches Monday morning, and there was this camaraderie on the lifts. Everybody at the resort had been there a few days and was thinking, \\nWell, I'm not going anywhere right now, so I might as well ski\\n. One of our friends kept saying, 'This is a unicorn day. This is amazing.' But there were also conversations about how you were going to get home and where you would stay if you couldn't.\\n\\n\\nJudd:\\n Monday night we decided to wake up Tuesday and go the long way home through Kremmling and Silverthorne to I-70. Apparently everyone else stranded in Winter Park and Steamboat was thinking the exact same thing that we were: \\nTuesday is a sunny day. Temps are warmer. Let's go.\\n\\n\\nNicole:\\n We finally \\nstopped for lunch\\n around noon at the first gas station on the edge of Silverthorne. Full sections were empty of food. The bathroom line was out the door. Back in the car, we spent two hours going two miles through town. When we finally got on I-70, the pass up to the Eisenhower Tunnel had numerous cars stalled because the conditions were so slushy. We saw a tow truck pushing a trailer, which was pushing a truck up the pass.\\n\\n\\nJudd:\\n Once we got through the tunnel, it was smooth sailing, in part because Berthoud Pass was closed and there was no additional traffic from U.S. 40. We were lucky that we had a place to stay while we were stranded, and we got a great ski day out of it. But if you're asking if the skiing was worth the eight-hour drive with three kids? Still not sure.\\n\\n\\nOur Proposal for Making it Better:\\n In Silverthorne, the freeway was moving pretty fast, but the lights in town weren't getting the cars through efficiently. There needed to be something or someone to override the lights.\\n\\n\\nRachael Scala Welch\\n\\n\\nTime in Colorado\\n: 10 years\\n\\n\\nPersonal hell\\n: 33 hours to get from Steamboat Springs to Nederland\\n\\n\\nRachael Scala Welch's ETA to her home in Ned over MLK weekend. Photo courtesy of Rachael Scala Welch\\n\\n\\nOur hope was to take Cameron Pass back from Steamboat Monday morning so we could do some backcountry skiing, but that was thwarted because CO 14 was closed. Plan B was to take Berthoud Pass, but that was also closed. We had our camper, so \\nwe overnighted in Hot Sulphur Springs\\n and soaked Tuesday morning to wait out traffic. It was beautiful\\u2026 until we saw that the only way to get back home was via I-70. That meant going through the Silverthorne/Summit County/Eisenhower Tunnel disaster that we were trying to avoid the whole time.\\n\\n\\nI've never seen anything that hectic. We walked around Lake Dillon while watching traffic, but realized there was really no other option besides staying another night. And even if we had, there was nowhere to stay. We ended up getting home Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. After this experience, I've vowed to \\nbackcountry tour\\n only and to stay local for the next holiday weekend during ski season.\\n\\n\\nMy Proposal for Making it Better:\\n MLK weekend highlighted the need for rapid, renewable-energy-powered mass transit from the Front Range to the mountains. That would make travel safer, better for the environment, and it would make visiting and living at our beloved mountain destinations easier. In the meantime, we can carpool and ask our employers for opportunities to ski during the week.\\n \\nLauryn Stasiak waits in line at Vail on MLK weekend.

I was planning on going that Sunday, and we heard that Vail was getting two inches of snow the night before. It took us a little bit longer than normal to get there, but traffic wasn't bad. And the snow was insane. Like, it was two feet of powder! At 2:45 p.m., we thought, \\nLet's go beat the traffic\\n. When we got to our car, we saw that Vail Pass was closed. We didn't hear anything about the tunnel being closed, so we drove down to Leadville to get to Copper and had about an hour of delays.\\n\\n\\nOnce we got back onto I-70, it was open roads, and we thought, \\nSweet! We're good!\\n Then we pulled up to Silverthorne. That's when we just saw red, red, red, red, red on the map\\u2014and tail lights for what seemed like the next million-and-a-half miles. Google Maps said that the traffic to the tunnel was an hour and 27 minutes, and we thought we could sit there for that. If we had known we were going to be in the traffic from Silverthorne to the tunnel for five hours, we would have pulled over. It was the worst traffic of my life.\\n\\n\\nMy Proposal for Making it Better:\\n \\nI had no service on my phone because there were thousands of people sitting in that traffic using the phone towers. They need more cell towers. And \\nfood trucks\\n on the side of the highway.\\n \\n4 Tips for Avoiding I-70 Ski Traffic\\n\\n\\nHeading into the mountains? Be prepared ahead of time.\",\n",

The farm benefits from a county program that helps small growers get their produce to more people. Image: Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\nIn a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. \\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. \\u2014 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.\\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.\\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops. Image: Rachel Woolf for NPR\\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2014 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2014 many of mixed immigration status \\u2014 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\nWin, win, win\\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \\nA purple daikon radish grown at Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., and other vegetables are prepared to be served at a meeting to discuss support for small Colorado farmers in December. Image: Rachel Woolf for NPR\\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains. \\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets. Image: Rachel Woolf for NPR\\nA force for good\\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability. Image: Rachel Woolf for NPR\\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo. Image: Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2014 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food. \\nCopyright 2024 NPR.

      "            \"summary\": \"Every year, The New York Times publishes a list titled '52 Places to Go,' and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming. But most of those far-flung locales are bucket-listers, the kinds of destinations that make for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or a special adventure.\\n\\nSo we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024, but with more manageable goals \\u2014 and with a nod toward Colorado connections. We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport, because travel is already difficult these days \\u2014 prices, crowds, cancellations. Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nBon voyage.\\n\\nIN COLORADO\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of , Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft beer highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which \\u2014 like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei \\u2014 are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range \\u2014 at any time of year, really \\u2014 in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore \\u2014 and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nSpring training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s \\u2014 a nice break from cold Colorado weather \\u2014 and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, N.M.\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so youi can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, N.C.\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, N.C., in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25\\u2013June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings \\u2014 which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but  \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to The Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

Very few other women will 'rough it' in the wilderness like we four do.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, Ruth approached my husband and explained that they'd been avoiding more trips for the past year, as they didn't think I enjoyed the trips.\\n\\nI emailed them to offer reassurance that I do enjoy the trips \\u2013 and our friendship \\u2013 and asked them to join me for dinner to discuss this while I was home alone for a week (my husband was traveling).\\n\\nThey shut me down for any in-person interactions, saying that I project my unhappiness onto them, that they walk on eggshells around me, that I caused multiple instances of tension, and because of my 'impacts' they would remain intentionally unavailable.\\n\\nAmy, I was completely shocked! I had no idea they felt this way.\\n\\nThey put on a good mask \\u2013 for years. These people I thought were close friends shoved me aside \\u2013 by email. If they had been honest about the tension they felt, I might have been able to change my behavior, or at least understand what was bothering them.\\n\\nInstead, I am confused, grieving a friendship, and just \\u2026 really hurt.\\n\\nThey acted like 'nice people,' so this came as a shock.\\n\\nI am now questioning whether many other 'friends' dislike spending time with me, and are walking on eggshells.\\n\\nI feel social anxiety building in me.\\n\\nWhat can I do to move on and feel better about myself?\\n\\n\\u2013 Broken Eggshells\\n\\nDear Broken:\\n\\nThe one person you've left out of your narrative is your husband. He is in the best position to gauge your behavior, as well as others' reactions to you, on these trips.\\n\\nYou might have a blunt communication style that other people interpret as anger or tension. Instead of accepting, adjusting to, or rolling with your bluntness, they try to avoid it (by 'walking on eggshells').\\n\\nYour choice to contact the couple and attempt to confront this issue personally in order to clear the air is one sign of your approach to problems. While to me this seems honest, forthright and fearless \\u2013 this other couple seem to see your approach as aggressive, negative, or even hostile.\\n\\nThis current challenge presents opportunities for you to gain insight into your own behavior and its impact on others.\\n\\nI suggest that you adopt an attitude of open inquiry regarding your own behavior by surveying people who know you best and love you the most.\\n\\nYour husband and siblings (if you have them) should be able to offer you honest feedback about your interactions.\\n\\nAfter taking a clear-eyed look at your own behavior (and making changes, if need be) you then have the right to judge this other couple as being disingenuous.\\n\\nDear Amy:\\n\\nI'm a woman working as a nurse in a busy hospital.\\n\\nI have a younger colleague who at this point has a weekend shift.\\n\\nTwo or three times a month, he asks me to change shifts with him. Sometimes I say yes \\u2013 but most of the time I say no.\\n\\nLast weekend, as usual, he asked me to switch shifts with him, but I told him that I had family obligations over the weekend and couldn't do that.\\n\\nHe got really upset with me and said he was going to go to our supervisor.\\n\\nHe did, and our supervisor sided with me.\\n\\nHe now refuses to speak to me. I feel bad about it and I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing.\\n\\n\\u2013 Tired in the ER\\n\\nDear Tired:\\n\\nYour supervisor stood up for your right (and duty) to work the shifts you've been assigned. This person likely assigns shifts for specific reasons (aside from availability).\\n\\nYour co-worker was arrogant enough to take this issue to your supervisor. At this point you might be relieved that he won't speak to you \\u2013 but if this avoidance interferes with your ability to provide good patient care, your supervisor should again be told.\\n\\n  | Ask Amy: Single woman has radar for dating jerks\\n\\nAsk Amy: Single woman has radar for dating jerks  | Ask Amy: Facebook romance worries wife\\n\\nAsk Amy: Facebook romance worries wife  | Ask Amy: Married couple ponders parenthood\\n\\nAsk Amy: Married couple ponders parenthood  | Ask Amy: Blended family is not really blended\\n\\nAsk Amy: Blended family is not really blended  | Ask Amy: Sudden loss leads to other losses Dear Amy:\\n\\nI enjoyed the question from 'Tired,' who wondered how to get guests to leave at the end of an evening.\\n\\nMy grandfather had a saying that he would invoke when he got tired.\\n\\nHe would say, 'Let's go to bed now so these nice people can go home.'\\n\\n\\u2013 Lisa\\n\\nDear Lisa:\\n\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n(You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

She passed away peacefully at home on January 22, 2024 at the age of 93. Madelyn grew up in Denver, graduating from South High School in 1948. She married Ellsworth 'Dick' Richards, her high school sweetheart, on May 26, 1950. They were married for 72 years before his passing in December of 2022. In 1976 they moved to Longmont from Littleton, and in 1990 Dick established his own income tax preparation firm, which Madelyn assisted him with until retiring in 2019. Madelyn was very active in her community- she was a member of St. Stephens Episcopal Church, and loved singing in the choir. She was also a member of the P.E.O. Sisterhood, which provides educational opportunities for female students worldwide. She was an avid bridge player, and loved to travel \\u2013 visiting every continent except Asia. She is preceded in death by her parents, her brothers Victor and Newton Pritchard, husband Ellsworth 'Dick' Richards, daughters Lori and Danna Richards, and son-in-law Ken Cordova. Madelyn is survived by her daughter Belinda Cordova of Longmont, CO, grandchildren Alyssa (Travis) Stanley of Aurora, CO, Brandon (Crystal) Cordova of Longmont, CO, Dustin Cordova of Westminster, CO, and great-grandchildren Raegan, Payten, Madesyn, and Austin Stanley of Aurora, CO. A Memorial Service for Madelyn will be held at 11:00 AM on Wednesday, February 7, 2024 at St. Mary Magdalene Episcopal Church 4775 Cambridge St. Boulder, CO 80301. In lieu of flowers, donations may be made to the Journey Academy Building Fund.\",\n",

'Though Denver has one of the highest rates of food halls in the country, Longmont has been left out of the fun, until now.'\\n\\n\\nBlackfox Parkway Associates owns the building where Parkway Food Hall is slated to go. Dallas-based National Food Hall Solutions, which opened Denver's Junction Food & Drink in 2020, will serve as the project's operating partner.\\n\\n\\nSo far, Denver-based restaurant Chile con Quesadilla and Cleaver & Co., which offers burgers, chicken sandwiches and shakes, have been confirmed as two of Parkway Food Hall's dining spots.\\n\\n\\nNational Food Hall Solutions CEO Pat Garza said in an interview Friday that the other food offerings will likely include: Asian fusion, barbecue, empanadas, sandwiches, Mediterranean cuisine, pizza and pasta.\\n\\n\\nParkway Food Hall is also set to have a coffee shop as well as a bar with beer, wine and cocktail offerings.\\n \\n'The bar is a circular bar with an indoor/outdoor feature that will have a garage door that opens up to the patio, which is going to have, I believe \\u2026 80, 90 seats out there,' Garza said. 'It opens to a beautiful courtyard where we plan on having events and live music.'\\n\\n\\nWhen asked if he envisioned local, Longmont vendors as being a part of Parkway Food Hall's many offerings, Garza replied 'absolutely.'\\n \\nIn addition to food, drinks and retail space, Parkway Food Hall will have an events area, equipped with audio and video technology, that can be rented out.\\n\\n\\nGarza said the team behind Parkway Food Hall hopes to open for business in time for Cinco De Mayo events on May 5.\\n\\n\\n'The food hall, itself, is going to be very family friendly and really driven by events,' Garza said. 'We'll be driving a lot of sporting events, live music, family events, holiday events; we really want to position ourselves as a place that embraces the families but also has something going on pretty much every day.'\\n\\n\\nParkway Food Hall is expected to be open for business from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m. Sundays through Wednesdays; 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. Thursdays; and 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. or later on Fridays and Saturdays, Garza said. The coffee shop is slated to open as early as 7 a.m.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"A snowy Saturday didn't deter hundreds of music lovers from coming to downtown Longmont for the sixth annual Winter Walkabout Music Showcase.\\n\\n\\nThe event featured more than 50 live performances by local musicians, who played in more than 15 venues within the Longmont Creative District. The district centers around the bars and coffee shops surrounding downtown Main Street, from Copper Sky Distillery at 110 Emery St., on the south end, to MeCo Coffee Collective at 627 Main St., on the north end. This year's lineup represented a wide range of musical styles and genres, from hip-hop to funk to soul.\\n\\n\\nKimberlee McKee, executive director of the \\nLongmont Downtown Development Authority\\n, said the showcase sold more than 900 tickets online. People could also buy tickets in person on Saturday at Dry Land Distillers, 519 Main St., which saw plenty of foot traffic from music lovers who seemed undeterred by a winter snowstorm.\\n\\n\\nDave Lloyd plays with Audio Medz on Saturday at the Elks Ballroom, 306 Coffman St., in Longmont, as part of the Winter Walkabout event. (Cliff Grassmick/Staff Photographer)\\n\\n\\n'A lot of people are saying, \\u2018It's finally a winter walkabout,'' McKee said.\\n\\n\\nMcKee said that the showcase injects some energy and excitement into downtown Longmont during a traditionally slow time of the year.\\n\\n\\n'From people that come each year to business owners, people just really look forward to this,' McKee said. 'It's a good \\u2013 when you have cabin fever \\u2013 way to go out and explore.'\\n \\nDry Land Distillers owner Nels Wroe said that in addition to being the hub for ticket sales, the distillery also hosted meet-and-greets for this year's musicians and their fans.\\n\\n\\n'We talked with the musicians last year who felt like they really needed to have a non-performance venue where they could actually regroup and meet people,' Wroe said.\\n \\nWroe added that the showcase is great for a local business like Dry Land Distillers because it emphasizes guests engaging with the venues \\u2013 something an outdoor or street concert wouldn't necessarily do.\\n\\n\\n'It's probably the most effective arts event that we have in Longmont,' Wroe said. 'We have people walking in from Boulder, from Denver that have never been here, and they're blown away by Longmont businesses.'\\n\\n\\nOne of the many returning venues was record store Absolute Vinyl at 319 Main St. Filled with albums by decades upon decades of musicians, the small store offered an intimate performance experience to those who stopped by.\\n\\n\\nThis year also saw a couple of new downtown businesses serve as performance venues, including Bricks Retail at 417 Main St. Bricks was a walkabout sponsor previously, but the store's new Main Street location allowed the owners to actually host musicians this year.\\n\\n\\nGreg Benton, second from the left, and Native Station, play at The Speakeasy, a basement bar at 301 Main St., in Longmont, as part of the Winter Walkabout event. Organizers said they sold more than 900 tickets.(Cliff Grassmick/Staff Photographer)\\n\\n\\n'We definitely have been part of the community for a number of years, and we're excited to bring this venue to life with music,' said Bricks owner Jennifer Ferguson.\\n\\n\\nThe Passenger, the restaurant underneath the Dickens Opera House at 302 Main St., also joined as a showcase venue for the first time. While the Dickens Opera House is one of the showcase's biggest venues, The Passenger got a chance this year to spend Saturday serenading dining guests with live music.\\n\\n\\n'It's a historic venue, and locals look forward to concerts and events,' said restaurant co-owner Madhoo Seth. 'This is our first time, so there's a lot of excitement.'\",\n",

After Sater died in 2020, Schweger took up the mantle to keep the sale going.\\n\\n\\n'She came up with this idea as a way for the average person to sell their items and not have to wait for summer to have a garage sale,' Schweger said of her mom. 'It just gives people an opportunity to sell their stuff and for shoppers to find treasures.'\\n\\n\\nThis year's Super Duper Garage Sale included 102 vendors, which Schweger said is on par with the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. She also estimated a couple thousand visitors attending the sale between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday.\\n \\nSchweger said many of the shoppers are repeat customers; around 100 people even showed up at 8 a.m. for an hour of 'early shopping' before doors opened to the public.\\n\\n\\n'A lot of people look forward to this event every year,' Schweger said. 'It's really exciting. My mom, she loved this event. It's amazing to see people love it so much, too.'\\n \\nSchweger explained that while some of the vendors are professional dealers, others are simply locals hoping to move some items out of storage. The result is booth upon booth of antiques and one-of-a-kind items, all under one roof.\\n\\n\\n'There really isn't any other event like this,' she said. 'It's so big, and you don't know what you're going to find. There's some of everything here.'\\n\\n\\n'Some of everything' is a fitting description of this year's sale. A walk through the vendor booths reveals the unique taste of each seller, whether that's boxes of old vinyl records, a collection of Vans sneakers or a table full of Elvis Presley memorabilia.\\n\\n\\nBoulder vendor Julie Crofford, who has been selling at the event for 20 years, called the sale a good opportunity for dealers to organize their inventory and learn what buyers are interested in.\\n\\n\\n'It's really a good service for our community and for the community of dealers,' Crofford said.\\n\\n\\nMelissa Durovich from Louisville has spent roughly a decade selling at the Super Duper Garage Sale, featuring handcrafted items like textiles and rugs.\\n\\n\\n'With the way things have changed so much with the internet, to have a show like this that has lasted 30 years speaks volumes,' Durovich said. '(Through) face-to-face shopping, you get to meet the customers, what they're looking for, what their trends are.'\\n\\n\\nDurovich said she keeps returning to the sale because of its 'fantastic customers.' She mentioned a shopper on Saturday who thanked her for the skateboard she sold to him last year.\\n\\n\\n'It's a great way to kick off the year,' Durovich said.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Mary Mumberson Sebesta passed away peacefully on December 18, 2023, with her son, Robert by her side at the Katheryn and Charles Hover Green Houses, in Longmont, Colorado. She is survived by two sons, Robert E Sebesta and David P Sebesta and wife Amy L (Crossman) Sebesta, and three wonderful grandchildren: Lindsey C Sebesta, Katheryn 'Kate' N Sebesta, and Henry C Sebesta. She is predeceased by her husband, Henry R Sebesta. We are so grateful that she spent her last hours with her sons, daughter-in-law, granddaughters, grandson and his significant other, Gabby Palumbo, and Mary's longtime friend, Angie Reece all gathered around providing her support and comfort. Born Mary Cecil Mumberson in Alvin, Texas on August 18, 1939 to parents Cecil and Katheryn (Anderson) Mumberson, Mary excelled in school having attended primary school in Alvin, and secondary school at Alvin Junior College, Sam Houston State Teachers College, and then completed her Master's Degree in Library Science at Louisiana State University (LSU) in 1961. After college, Mary worked at McMurry University in Abilene, Texas as a Catalog Librarian, and then in 1963 she took a job at the Texas State Library, Austin, Texas to be close to her fianc\\u00e9, Henry and worked all summer to earn money for their wedding (August 31, 1963) and honeymoon. Mary had known Henry from high school and Alvin Junior College, and they were married over 53 years when Henry passed away in 2016. Mary became a stay-at-home Mom when David was born in 1964, and then Mary and Henry raised their two boys while Henry's career moved them to Stillwater, Ok; Arlington, Tx; and Albuquerque, NM. Mary continued to volunteer in the libraries at each school the boys attended and stayed busy as a Swimming and Soccer Mom during those seasons. When the boys became 'adults', Mary ran the family side business of real estate investing, managing the finances and communications to develop properties. The last of which became Henry and Mary's dream retirement 'Eureka Ranch' property near Salida, CO. In 2008, facing the prospects of another winter at 8,500 feet of elevation, they decided to sell the ranch and move to Longmont just around the corner from David, Amy, and the grandchildren. Mary was born with a condition called Cerebral Palsy but was raised to fight and overcome her challenges. Mary did not let this condition keep her from doing 'almost everything' she wanted to do in life. Mary was always more concerned about how others were feeling than herself. At her residence in Assisted Living, her room was often a refuge where caregivers stopped for a break and discussion about life's challenges. And she loved to laugh with her caregivers and physical therapists. Mary was like a second Mom to Dwight Adkins and Gavin Gillette, close friends of her boys growing up, that have stayed connected with Mary throughout their lives. Mary always felt loved and accepted by Henry's brothers and sister and loved her nieces and nephews with all of her heart. She was an inspiration to her family, friends, and caregivers right up to her last days. May she rest in peace. There will be a Celebration of Life in Mary's honor later this Spring near Houston, Texas. In lieu of flowers, please consider a donation to one of Mary's favorite charities for the doggies: Canine Partners of the Rockies, Longmont Humane Society, or The Iditarod Trail Committee.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Dear Amy:\\n\\nRecently an out-of-state couple moved into our neighborhood, due to being transferred by their workplaces.\\n\\nThese people are charming, but the problem is that they smoke.\\n\\nTheir clothes, their house and their cars smell like cigarettes.\\n\\nThe smell makes me nauseous.\\n\\nThe state we live in is basically a non-smoking state. You cannot even smoke on most beaches.\\n\\nWe invited this couple to our annual outdoor holiday party.\\n\\nI dug out the 'Please, no smoking' signs I had stored away and placed them in the outside planters.\\n\\nWhen they arrived, they immediately lit up.\\n\\nWe greeted them and I politely pointed out the signs. They apologized and put out their cigarettes in the planters, (when they weren't looking, I removed the butts). Within 10 minutes they left and smoked on the sidewalk next to our backyard.\\n\\nThe noxious smell carried into our party and clung to them when they returned.\\n\\nSome guests commented about cigarettes, because it is a rare smell these days. They are planning a dinner at their home to thank us for the invitation.\\n\\nWe suggested a restaurant, but the wife wants to cook a special meal for us and a few of the other neighbors.\\n\\nAs much as I like them, their smoking habit makes me literally sick and I do not want to pursue this friendship because of this habit.\\n\\nMy husband agrees, because the smell gives him a headache.\\n\\nHow do we decline?\\n\\nRight now, we're stalling.\\n\\nDo we explain that cigarette smoke makes us ill?\\n\\n\\u2014 Reluctant Neighbor\\n\\nDear Reluctant:\\n\\nIf these people had cats and you were allergic to dander, you would let them know.\\n\\nMany states ban smoking in any public place \\u2014 even on sidewalks.\\n\\nIf contact with the noxious residual smell of cigarette smoking makes you ill, then you owe it to yourself to guard your own health.\\n\\nIt is your responsibility to protect your own health and wellness.\\n\\nSo yes, you should tell these neighbors that unfortunately exposure to any smoke \\u2014 or the residual smell of cigarette smoke \\u2014 aggravates your allergies, and makes you both ill, so you assume it would be an issue for you to spend time inside their house.\\n\\nDear Amy:\\n\\nA few close co-workers (including me) recently attended a destination wedding of a colleague and friend.\\n\\nOur department leader was also invited and attended.\\n\\nEverything went well and a nice time was had by all.\\n\\nFast-forward to today, and our department leader now wants to have quarterly get-togethers for the group that attended the wedding.\\n\\nI have hesitations about this for a few reasons. First, if word gets out about this exclusive outing, others on the team will feel like we're getting preferential treatment (which I definitely understand). Second, while the leader said anyone is welcome to come, I feel like this will seem more like an obligation outside of work that you can't say no to.\\n\\nMy colleagues and I are unsure how to bring these concerns up without causing hurt feelings.\\n\\nWhat should we do?\\n\\n\\u2014 Troubled Team\\n\\nDear Troubled:\\n\\nYou have valid concerns about these outings.\\n\\nI agree that gathering some members of the team for scheduled outings is not a good idea, and 'anyone is welcome to come' is quite different from 'all team members are invited and included.'\\n\\nYou might assume that this idea grew out of that unique sort of post-party glow when the hangover fades but the good feelings linger, and that given some time to consider the professional ramifications in terms of team morale, your fearless leader might reconsider this idea and let it quietly go away.\\n\\nI'm not sure how it would cause 'hurt feelings' for you and other team members to react to this idea by bringing up the professional challenges it might cause, as well as the unexpressed pressure that is exerted when a 'boss' plans team outings. Are these gatherings compulsory? Will people who can't attend because of other obligations (or because they don't want to) miss out on intangibles important to professional success?\\n\\n  | Ask Amy: Parents ponder son's athletic ability\\n\\nAsk Amy: Parents ponder son's athletic ability  | Ask Amy: A messy affair reveals \\u2018Daddy issues'\\n\\nAsk Amy: A messy affair reveals \\u2018Daddy issues'  | Ask Amy: Miserable wife contemplates next steps\\n\\nAsk Amy: Miserable wife contemplates next steps  | Ask Amy: Assault survivor wants to keep trauma private\\n\\nAsk Amy: Assault survivor wants to keep trauma private  | Ask Amy: Grandson's clothing can't travel between homes Dear Amy:\\n\\n'No Messy Feelings Allowed' was frustrated because when she shared her 'messier' feelings with her friend, the friend jumped in with lots of solutions.\\n\\nThe question my family and I ask when someone shares a problem is: 'Do you want to be helped, heard, or hugged.'\\n\\nWorks like a charm!\\n\\n\\u2014 Ann\\n\\nDear Ann:\\n\\nI've had a lot of responses to this question, which brings up the issue of offering \\u2014 and receiving unsolicited advice.\\n\\nI really appreciate your approach.\\n\\n(You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

      "            \"summary\": \"12\\n \\nBy Brad Brooks\\n \\n(Reuters) -Jury selection began in Pontiac, Michigan, on Tuesday in a rare trial of a parent who prosecutors have charged with being complicit in a mass shooting carried out by her son in 2021.\\n \\nLawyers began questioning prospective jurors in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley, whose then-15-year-old son Ethan murdered four fellow students at Oxford High School with a gun his parents had given him as a Christmas gift. \\n \\nEthan Crumbley pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder, and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole.\\n \\nJennifer Crumbley and her husband James Crumbley were being tried separately after being charged with four manslaughter counts in late 2021. They have remained in jail since. James Crumbley's trial opens on March 5. \\n \\nWhen the charges were announced, prosecutors said the Crumbleys' failure to both secure the gun in their home and to respond to warnings that their son, Ethan, was violent and disturbed, justified the charges they face.\\n \\nDefense attorneys have said in court documents that the Crumbleys had no way of knowing their son was going to carry out the shooting.\\n \\nLegal experts have said the parents' trial, which appears to be the first of its kind, breaks new legal ground. \\n \\nJosh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, said school shooter's parents are often not held to account because of feelings that 'they've been through enough' or because of lax enforcement of such measures as safe storage laws. \\n \\nHolding more parents responsible when appropriate is an important step, Horwitz said, given that studies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have shown that around 75% of all school shooters obtained their weapons in the home. \\n \\n'Rarely are high school shooters going out and buying guns from a gun store,' Horwitz said. 'The broader lesson from this case is that every parent who is a gun owner has a role to play, and that's the secure and safe storage of firearms.' \\n \\nPREVENTABLE TRAGEDY \\n \\nFour days before the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.\\n \\nRelated News: \\n\\u00a0 \\nStuck Driver Carjacks Good Samaritan Trying to Help Out\\nMichigan law prohibits those under 18 years of age from buying or possessing firearms, except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult.\\n \\nEthan posted photos of the gun on social media, writing, 'Just got my new beauty today' and adding a heart emoji. The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range 'testing out his new Christmas present,' Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said when she announced charges against the parents.\\n \\nThe day before the shooting at the school about 25 miles (40 km) north of Detroit, a teacher found Ethan Crumbley using his smart phone to search for ammunition and alerted school officials. The officials left messages for his mother that went unreturned. His mother later texted him, 'LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.'\\n \\nOn the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words 'Blood everywhere,' 'My life is useless,' and 'The thoughts won't stop \\u2013 help me.'\\n \\nEthan told school counselors the drawings were for a video game he was designing, school officials have said. \\n \\nThe Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.\\n \\nEthan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.\\n \\n'This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter's parents hadn't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the shooter, or if his parents had taken basic steps to securely store the gun,' said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of Law and Policy at the anti-gun violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. 'They should be held accountable.'\\n \\n (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; editing by Donna Bryson, Michael Perry and Jonathan Oatis)\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"28\\n \\nBy Brad Brooks\\n \\n(Reuters) -A Michigan woman facing manslaughter charges for a school shooting carried out by her son wants him to testify in her defense, according to court documents filed Tuesday. \\n \\nThat came as jury selection began in the trial that legal experts say is unprecedented, and that gun safety advocates hope prompts more parents to be held to account for their roles in school shootings.\\n \\nEthan Crumbley, who was 15 at the time of the 2021 shooting at Oxford High School, pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder, and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole. He carried out the shooting with a gun his parents bought him as a Christmas present.\\n \\nIn documents filed with the court in Pontiac, Michigan, Shannon Smith, the defense attorney for Jennifer Crumbley, 45, asked the Sixth Judicial Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews to force Ethan Crumbley to testify in his mother's trial. Smith also asked the judge to order psychiatrists who have treated Ethan Crumbley to testify. \\n \\nAttorneys from the State Appellate Defender Office, who are representing Ethan Crumbley as he appeals his life sentence, are fighting any order that would compel him or psychiatrists who have treated him to testify in the trial of his mother or father.\\n \\n'We will advise Ethan to invoke his right to remain silent,' Ethan Crumbley's attorneys, Jacqueline Ouvry and Alison Swain, wrote in a Tuesday filing.\\n \\nJury selection began on Tuesday, with lawyers working to seat 12 jurors and five alternates from a pool of at least 300. \\n \\nJennifer Crumbley and her husband James Crumbley, 47, are being tried separately after being charged with four manslaughter counts in late 2021. They have remained in jail since. James Crumbley's trial opens on March 5. \\n \\nWhen the charges were announced, prosecutors said the Crumbleys' failure to both secure the gun in their home and to respond to warnings that their son, Ethan, was violent and disturbed, justified the charges they face.\\n \\nDefense attorneys have said in court documents that the Crumbleys had no way of knowing their son was going to carry out the shooting.\\n \\nLegal experts have said the parents' trials break new legal ground. \\n \\nJosh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, said school shooter's parents are often not held to account because of feelings that 'they've been through enough' or because of lax enforcement of such measures as safe storage laws. \\n \\nHolding more parents responsible when appropriate is an important step, Horwitz said, given that studies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have shown that around 75% of all school shooters obtained their weapons in the home. \\n \\n'Rarely are high school shooters going out and buying guns from a gun store,' Horwitz said. 'The broader lesson from this case is that every parent who is a gun owner has a role to play, and that's the secure and safe storage of firearms.' \\n \\nPREVENTABLE TRAGEDY \\n \\nFour days before the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.\\n \\nEthan posted photos of the gun on social media, writing, 'Just got my new beauty today' and adding a heart emoji. The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range 'testing out his new Christmas present,' Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said when she announced charges against the parents.\\n \\nThe day before the shooting at the school about 25 miles (40 km) north of Detroit, a teacher found Ethan Crumbley using his smart phone to search for ammunition and alerted school officials. The officials left messages for his mother that went unreturned. His mother later texted him, 'LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.'\\n \\nOn the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words 'Blood everywhere,' 'My life is useless,' and 'The thoughts won't stop \\u2013 help me.'\\n \\nThe Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.\\n \\nEthan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.\\n \\n'This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter's parents hadn't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the shooter, or if his parents had taken basic steps to securely store the gun,' said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of Law and Policy at the anti-gun violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. 'They should be held accountable.'\\n \\n (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; editing by Jonathan Oatis and Stephen Coates)\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Co-owners Annie and Doug Gaddy at Absolute Vinyl in Longmont. Courtesy: Doug Gaddy\\n \\nNorth Carolina native Doug Gaddy opened \\nAbsolute Vinyl Records & Stereo\\n in a tiny, spartan space in then-quiet North Boulder in 2009 with the help of his wife, Annie. The shop made fast fans, finding its niche by cleaning and grading every record it sells and boasting shelves full of vintage but near-mint, turntables, speakers and receivers. Doug and Annie weren't in that location for long.\\n \\n'The fire department came by to inspect that building every four or five months, because it should have been condemned. I couldn't wait to get out of there,' Gaddy says. 'It was part of a remnant of an entire world that existed in North Boulder when it was a home for the disaffected, disadvantaged and disgruntled. I was there in the last days of that.'\\n \\nAbsolute Vinyl \\u2014 currently celebrating its 15th year in business \\u2014 was only in that original location for a little under two years before moving to a larger storefront on Arapahoe Avenue near 55th Street. Gaddy would stay in that location, attracting vinyl and stereo enthusiasts and creating a tight-knit community that included several young employees attached to a short-lived but vital local label called \\nFirst Base Tapes\\n, until about a year before the COVID-19 pandemic. That's when he took a leap of faith and moved to Main Street in Longmont.\\n \\nThe rent is cheaper, the foot-traffic is better in downtown Longmont, and a lot of people are moving there from more expensive areas of Boulder County. Gaddy won't say whether he sees the new Absolute Vinyl as a big improvement; he'll just say it's 'different.'\\n \\n'Everything is different than everything else, but Longmont's really happy I'm there, and I'm happy to be in Longmont,' he says. 'Boulder is totally different than when I left. I mean, there's no way to compare anything, given the last five years of existence on earth; it's apples and moon rocks. Everything's been touched by the tumult of that period.'\\n \\nOne thing's for sure, according to Gaddy: He hears 'I just moved to Longmont' all the time. 'A lot of new blood is in the shop, so to speak, in terms of the customer base,' he says. 'It's folks out exploring because they're excited to be in Longmont. They find it an interesting place to live.'\\n \\n\\n\\nGiselle Collazo (left) and Brenda Gurung clean used LPs at Absolute Vinyl. Image courtesy: Doug Gaddy\\n \\nLike the old days of \\nAlbums on the Hill\\n when owner Andy Schneidkraut was holding court on 13th Street, a large part of Absolute Vinyl's attraction is the chance to talk records and audio equipment with Gaddy. He has been selling albums in some form or another \\u2014 initially focusing on record shows\\u2014 since the late 1980s. As the story goes, Gaddy had the geekdom necessary to curate, and his wife had an impressive ability to make all the other geeks comfortable socially.\\n \\nSince Absolute Vinyl cleans and grades every single used record his shop puts on sale, the result is never wondering the exact condition an LP might be in when you put it on your turntable at home.\\n \\nGaddy says he knows 'the ache of heartbreak' from discovering after you've bought a used record that it's not in as good condition as you thought, so he wanted to avoid his customers suffering the same surprise. He remembers selling records on eBay in the late 1990s and early 2000s and needing them to be in pristine condition to avoid bad reviews from 'fussy' European and Asian buyers. He says that contributed to his obsession with cleaning and grading.\\n \\n'I don't want to sound like I'm tooting my own horn, but I get people who come to the shop and say, \\u2018I only come to your shop,' because as record-shoppers the condition of the record is really important,' he says. 'I want people to know what they're getting, and I want what they believe they're getting in the shop to hold true once they get home. As a result, no one really returns records.'\\n \\nOther shops offer a big selection of music-related products, from band T-shirts to bobbleheads and lunchboxes, but Gaddy focuses on records and stereo equipment. Although he's changed locations a few times, it hasn't been for lack of business.\\n \\n'I proved my model [at Absolute Vinyl's original location],' he says. 'It was popular. I was in the black from the first month, and I stepped into much bigger rent [on Arapahoe], swallowed hard, got a much shinier, brighter place. By then, things were sort of turning around for the economy, and that was a great spot for eight-and-a-half years.'\\n \\nNow more than a decade since opening his first location, he and Annie have found a happy home for Absolute Vinyl. Just don't ask Gaddy to say he's satisfied.\\n \\n'What the hell, I might as well get existential: I don't know if I've ever felt at home anywhere,' he says. 'I'm always looking for what I can do next. I think I'm restless like that.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"From jewelry to baseball cards to vintage metal lunch boxes, Longmont's Super Duper Garage Sale is a haven for all kinds of buyers.\\n\\nOn Saturday, shoppers packed the exhibit building of the Boulder County Fairgrounds to take part in the sale, which celebrated its 30th anniversary this year. Alaina Schweger, event coordinator and co-owner of Longmont's Front Range Mercantile, said it feels 'awesome' for the sale to hit that milestone.\\n\\n'I feel like the show has really had more interest this year than ever before,' Schweger said.\\n\\nSchweger's mom, Marj Sater, is the founder of the Super Duper Garage Sale. After Sater died in 2020, Schweger took up the mantle to keep the sale going.\\n\\n'She came up with this idea as a way for the average person to sell their items and not have to wait for summer to have a garage sale,' Schweger said of her mom. 'It just gives people an opportunity to sell their stuff and for shoppers to find treasures.'\\n\\nThis year's Super Duper Garage Sale included 102 vendors, which Schweger said is on par with the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. She also estimated a couple thousand visitors attending the sale between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m. Saturday.\\n\\nSchweger said many of the shoppers are repeat customers; around 100 people even showed up at 8 a.m. for an hour of 'early shopping' before doors opened to the public.\\n\\n'A lot of people look forward to this event every year,' Schweger said. 'It's really exciting. My mom, she loved this event. It's amazing to see people love it so much, too.'\\n\\nSchweger explained that while some of the vendors are professional dealers, others are simply locals hoping to move some items out of storage. The result is booth upon booth of antiques and one-of-a-kind items, all under one roof.\\n\\n'There really isn't any other event like this,' she said. 'It's so big, and you don't know what you're going to find. There's some of everything here.'\\n\\n'Some of everything' is a fitting description of this year's sale. A walk through the vendor booths reveals the unique taste of each seller, whether that's boxes of old vinyl records, a collection of Vans sneakers or a table full of Elvis Presley memorabilia.\\n\\nBoulder vendor Julie Crofford, who has been selling at the event for 20 years, called the sale a good opportunity for dealers to organize their inventory and learn what buyers are interested in.\\n\\n'It's really a good service for our community and for the community of dealers,' Crofford said.\\n\\nMelissa Durovich from Louisville has spent roughly a decade selling at the Super Duper Garage Sale, featuring handcrafted items like textiles and rugs.\\n\\n'With the way things have changed so much with the internet, to have a show like this that has lasted 30 years speaks volumes,' Durovich said. '(Through) face-to-face shopping, you get to meet the customers, what they're looking for, what their trends are.'\\n\\nDurovich said she keeps returning to the sale because of its 'fantastic customers.' She mentioned a shopper on Saturday who thanked her for the skateboard she sold to him last year.\\n\\n'It's a great way to kick off the year,' Durovich said.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Every year, The New York Times publishes a list titled '52 Places to Go,' and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming. But most of those far-flung locales are bucket-listers, the kinds of destinations that make for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or a special adventure.\\n\\nSo we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024, but with more manageable goals \\u2014 and with a nod toward Colorado connections. We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport, because travel is already difficult these days \\u2014 prices, crowds, cancellations. Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nBon voyage.\\n\\nIN COLORADO\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of , Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft beer highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which \\u2014 like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei \\u2014 are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range \\u2014 at any time of year, really \\u2014 in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore \\u2014 and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nSpring training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s \\u2014 a nice break from cold Colorado weather \\u2014 and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, N.M.\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so youi can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, N.C.\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, N.C., in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25\\u2013June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings \\u2014 which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but  \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to The Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"KANSAS CITY \\u2014 Anyone monitoring the grain-based foods sector's financial results and listening to the evolving narratives of industry executives at publicly-traded companies knows the past year was difficult for the industry. For many of the sector's companies, the operating environment failed to develop in 2023 in ways conducive to sales and earnings growth chief executive officers had guided investors to anticipate. With the trimming of guidance at many companies, repeatedly in certain cases, the poor performance of grain-based foods share prices should not have been surprising. The share price weakness still managed to deliver a jolt.\\nDeclines in \\nMilling & Baking News\\n' Grain-Based Foods (GBF) Share Index have been a rarity over the last 15 years. Before 2023, the index was higher for 13 of the previous 14 years. The period included eight consecutive years of gains after a 22% drop in 2008.\\nJosh Sosland, editor of \\nMilling & Baking News\\n \\nSource: Sosland Publishing Co.\\nGiving the 2023 performance an especially negative look was not the absolute decline of 6.5%, only a moderate setback. It was the underperformance of the GBF index relative to broader market indexes, the worst in 20 years. Compared to the S&P 500 index, grain-based foods shares lagged by 30.7 percentage points. Relative to the NASDAQ index, the deficit was even greater \\u2014 49.5 percentage points.\\nSome comfort may be taken in the fact the S&P 500's surge in 2023 was driven by a relatively small number of companies, and 72% of the stocks in the index failed to achieve the benchmark's gain of 24%. Still, that statistic implies that more than one in four companies in the S&P 500 beat the index last year. Among the GBF shares, not a single company beat the S&P 500 last year, or even came close. The top performing stock in the index gained 12%, only half what the overall S&P 500 gained in 2023.\\nDespite the year's many negatives, perspective on what transpired last year paints a less dire picture and implies positive notes for what to expect in 2024. To begin, the sharp underperformance of grain-based foods shares last year represented a reversal from the year before when the GBF index beat the S&P 500 by about 27 points. Food companies are not impervious to market volatility. Targeting low single-digit sales growth each year and mid-single digit operating profit growth, the food sector is not positioned to generate double-digit share price gains year after year.\\nInstead of an indictment on the grain-based foods industry and its prospects, the underperformance last year for the most part has been characterized as a sector rotation within the investment community. Just as rising interest rates prompted investors to seek shelter in the safety of food stocks in 2022, optimism that interest rates had or had nearly peaked triggered a shift by investors to 'growthier' tech-oriented companies.\\nThose looking for hopeful signs for 2024 need look no further than the dynamism evident across the grain-based foods industry. In the bread segment for example, the success of numerous products currently trending positively was apparent in capital investments/acquisitions announced over the last couple years. Examples include a new plant to be built by King's Hawaiian in Indiana to deal with what the company called capacity constraints; the expansion of the J.M. Smucker Co. Longmont, Colo., Uncrustables plant; and Bimbo's acquisition in late 2022 of St Pierre Group, the baker of brioche-style products.\\nAlso cause for optimism were two major transactions completed over the past year, aimed at accelerating growth \\u2014 the spinoff of Kellogg Co. into Kellanova and WK Kellogg Co and the Smucker acquisition of Hostess Brands. Meanwhile, food, beverage and processing companies go into 2024 with far more attractive relative valuation than was the case in January 2023. Despite last year's difficulties, there is cause for optimism in the new year.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Every year, The New York Times publishes a list titled '52 Places to Go,' and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming. But most of those far-flung locales are bucket-listers, the kinds of destinations that make for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or a special adventure.\\n\\nSo we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024, but with more manageable goals \\u2014 and with a nod toward Colorado connections. We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport, because travel is already difficult these days \\u2014 prices, crowds, cancellations. Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nBon voyage.\\n\\nIN COLORADO\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of , Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft beer highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which \\u2014 like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei \\u2014 are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range \\u2014 at any time of year, really \\u2014 in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore \\u2014 and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nSpring training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s \\u2014 a nice break from cold Colorado weather \\u2014 and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, N.M.\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so youi can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, N.C.\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, N.C., in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25\\u2013June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings \\u2014 which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but  \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to The Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

But while drinkers laud the 6% alcohol-by-volume stout for its chocolatey creaminess, darker beers tend to take a backseat to lighter, crisper varieties as the weather warms.\\u00a0\\n \\nIn an effort to appeal to summertime sensibilities, Left Hand is rolling out its new Belgian White Nitro. While it's already available on draft at Left Hand's tasting room in Longmont, Left Hand RiNo Drinks & Eats in Denver and at select retailers, Belgian White Nitro will be 'hitting the market for real in the spring \\u2026 as the weather starts to warm up,' Left Hand co-founder Eric Wallace told BizWest. '\\u2026 Some accounts keep powering all year long with (orders for Milk Stout), but some don't. We would like to be able to give them something that moves a little quicker for the warmer months.'\\n \\nLeft Hand has had success with lighter brews in the past, namely Flamingo Dreams Nitro, a blonde ale brewed with raspberries.\\u00a0\\n \\nRe-releasing Flamingo Dreams isn't feasible 'because raspberry (harvests) have been decimated by fire and heat' in areas where they're grown in the Pacific Northwest, Wallace said. 'So it's going be a couple of years until that's an option again. Those of us who have raspberries in our beer have either swallowed a huge cost increase or raised our prices or discontinued' brews that include the fruit as an ingredient.\\u00a0\\n \\nBelgian White Nitro 'was our answer to that (ingredient-sourcing challenge) \\u2014 let's try to come up with something that nobody else is doing.'\\n \\nNitrogenated beers are made with a lower-carbonation brewing style that attempts to mimic European beers hand-pulled from a cask. The process can result in a smoother, creamier and snappier pint.\\u00a0\\n \\nLeft Hand is taking its successful nitrogenization approach and applying it to the Belgian white style of beer, typically made by combining wheat malt with barley grist. 'Coriander and orange peel are fairly traditional ingredients from the old-school Belgian witbiers,' Wallace said, and both are used in the Belgian White Nitro.\\n \\n'It's a lighter beer at 4.8%, but it has a lot of complexity,' he said. 'It's got some malty flavors to it, but it's also quite fruity \\u2026 while the nitro gives it a really soft mouthfeel.'\\n \\nBelgian White Nitro was developed over a period of about 18 months by Left Hand head brewer Gary Glass, who formerly served as the director of the American Homebrewers Association.\\n \\n'He's got some serious bona fides, so having him here running brewing is really cool,' Wallace said of Glass.\\n \\nTHe Belgian White Nitro formula was based on one of Glass' old homebrewing recipes.\\u00a0\\n \\n'At Left Hand we've always been on the forefront of nitro innovation and regularly explore new recipes and flavors to pilot,' Glass said in a prepared statement. 'Belgian White Nitro offers people the refreshing and familiar flavors of a Belgian-style wheat beer enhanced with the addition of nitrogen. The result is a beer that pours with a cascading effect, creating a silky mouthfeel like no other. We're very proud of this beer and are excited for others to experience it.'\\n \\n \\n \\nLONGMONT \\u2014 Longmont's \\nLeft Hand Brewing Co.\\n has carved out quite a niche for itself over the past three decades largely on the back of its renowned Milk Stout Nitro.

      "            \"summary\": \"Lawn care company The Toro Co. has selected Frederick for a research and development center for its robotics division.\\n \\nGov. Jared Polis and the Global  Development Division of the Colorado Office of Economic Development and International Trade said Friday that the company has decided to accept a state grant in order to establish the center there.\\n \\nBizWest previously reported \\nthat Toro was likely the company that had been offered incentives in April 2023 to establish its robotics operation in Colorado. \\nToro bought Longmont company Left Hand Robotics\\n in 2021. Left Hand had developed robotic snow removal equipment.\\n \\n'Colorado is known for our leadership in advanced manufacturing, and we are excited that Toro recognizes the opportunities for growth in Frederick, creating up to 45 good-paying jobs for Coloradans,' Polis said in a press statement.\\n \\nToro designs, manufactures, and markets lawn mowers, snow blowers, irrigation system supplies and other products for commercial, residential, agricultural and public sector uses. The products are distributed through a global network of distributors, dealers, rental stores and retailers in more than 125 countries. The company celebrated the opening of its new R&D center at a ribbon-cutting Friday.\\n \\n'Customer and environmental needs drive our innovation priorities with a focus on battery, autonomous and smart-connected solutions,' John Hurst, senior director for Toro's Center for Technology, Research and Innovation, said in a written statement. 'This investment in the Frederick facility expands our operational capacity, enables us to add talent and further supports our efforts to provide innovative solutions to our global customers, making their jobs easier and more productive.'\\n \\nToro expects to create up to 45 net new jobs at an average annual wage of $106,889, which is 179.6% of the average annual wage in Weld County. The positions will include engineers, customer support and technicians, the state said in its announcement.\\n \\n'Advanced manufacturing accounts for approximately 30% of Colorado's economy. By choosing Weld County for expansion, Toro will continue to diversify this important industry and ensure that rural communities like Frederick benefit from good-paying jobs,' said Eve Lieberman, OEDIT executive director.\\n \\nIn April 2023, the Colorado Economic Development Commission approved up to $519,626 in performance-based Job Growth Incentive Tax Credits for the company over an eight-year period. The incentives are contingent upon Toro, referred to as Project Columbia throughout the OEDIT review process, meeting net new job creation and salary requirements.\\n \\nFrederick mayor Tracie Crites said that the addition of Toro reaffirms 'Frederick's position for innovative, cutting-edge opportunities that improve quality of life. Frederick has a growing community of advanced manufacturing that supports industries including aerospace, biosciences, and robotics.'\\n \\nIn addition to Colorado, Toro also considered Minnesota, where it is headquartered, for expansion. The company has more than 11,000 employees, 27 of whom are in Colorado.\\n \\nWhen the company bought Left Hand Robotics, it said it would be maintaining its facility in Longmont. However, the company now said that it is relocating that staff and operation to Frederick into the new, leased 28,000-square-foot R&D operation.\\n \\nThe facility is at 4160 Busch Place in the Bear Industrial Park, which fronts Interstate 25 on the east side, south of Colo. 119. The developers of the project, Nick Larson and Jeff Hoffman of Bear Peak Development, acquired the site in 2021 and built a turnkey engineering and manufacturing facility for their tenant, Toro.\\n \\nToro produced its first robotic mower for the homeowner market in 2022 and began field testing its GeoLink Autonomous Fairway Mower to help golf courses alleviate labor shortages and budget constraints.\\n \\nThis article was first published by BizWest, an independent news organization, and is published under a license agreement. \\u00a9 2024 BizWest Media LLC.\",\n",

Very few other women will 'rough it' in the wilderness like we four do.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, Ruth approached my husband and explained that they'd been avoiding more trips for the past year, as they didn't think I enjoyed the trips.\\n\\nI emailed them to offer reassurance that I do enjoy the trips \\u2013 and our friendship \\u2013 and asked them to join me for dinner to discuss this while I was home alone for a week (my husband was traveling).\\n\\nThey shut me down for any in-person interactions, saying that I project my unhappiness onto them, that they walk on eggshells around me, that I caused multiple instances of tension, and because of my 'impacts' they would remain intentionally unavailable.\\n\\nAmy, I was completely shocked! I had no idea they felt this way.\\n\\nThey put on a good mask \\u2013 for years. These people I thought were close friends shoved me aside \\u2013 by email. If they had been honest about the tension they felt, I might have been able to change my behavior, or at least understand what was bothering them.\\n\\nInstead, I am confused, grieving a friendship, and just \\u2026 really hurt.\\n\\nThey acted like 'nice people,' so this came as a shock.\\n\\nI am now questioning whether many other 'friends' dislike spending time with me, and are walking on eggshells.\\n\\nI feel social anxiety building in me.\\n\\nWhat can I do to move on and feel better about myself?\\n\\n\\u2013 Broken Eggshells\\n\\nDear Broken:\\n\\nThe one person you've left out of your narrative is your husband. He is in the best position to gauge your behavior, as well as others' reactions to you, on these trips.\\n\\nYou might have a blunt communication style that other people interpret as anger or tension. Instead of accepting, adjusting to, or rolling with your bluntness, they try to avoid it (by 'walking on eggshells').\\n\\nYour choice to contact the couple and attempt to confront this issue personally in order to clear the air is one sign of your approach to problems. While to me this seems honest, forthright and fearless \\u2013 this other couple seem to see your approach as aggressive, negative, or even hostile.\\n\\nThis current challenge presents opportunities for you to gain insight into your own behavior and its impact on others.\\n\\nI suggest that you adopt an attitude of open inquiry regarding your own behavior by surveying people who know you best and love you the most.\\n\\nYour husband and siblings (if you have them) should be able to offer you honest feedback about your interactions.\\n\\nAfter taking a clear-eyed look at your own behavior (and making changes, if need be) you then have the right to judge this other couple as being disingenuous.\\n\\nDear Amy:\\n\\nI'm a woman working as a nurse in a busy hospital.\\n\\nI have a younger colleague who at this point has a weekend shift.\\n\\nTwo or three times a month, he asks me to change shifts with him. Sometimes I say yes \\u2013 but most of the time I say no.\\n\\nLast weekend, as usual, he asked me to switch shifts with him, but I told him that I had family obligations over the weekend and couldn't do that.\\n\\nHe got really upset with me and said he was going to go to our supervisor.\\n\\nHe did, and our supervisor sided with me.\\n\\nHe now refuses to speak to me. I feel bad about it and I'm wondering if I'm doing the right thing.\\n\\n\\u2013 Tired in the ER\\n\\nDear Tired:\\n\\nYour supervisor stood up for your right (and duty) to work the shifts you've been assigned. This person likely assigns shifts for specific reasons (aside from availability).\\n\\nYour co-worker was arrogant enough to take this issue to your supervisor. At this point you might be relieved that he won't speak to you \\u2013 but if this avoidance interferes with your ability to provide good patient care, your supervisor should again be told.\\n\\n  | Ask Amy: Single woman has radar for dating jerks\\n\\nAsk Amy: Single woman has radar for dating jerks  | Ask Amy: Facebook romance worries wife\\n\\nAsk Amy: Facebook romance worries wife  | Ask Amy: Married couple ponders parenthood\\n\\nAsk Amy: Married couple ponders parenthood  | Ask Amy: Blended family is not really blended\\n\\nAsk Amy: Blended family is not really blended  | Ask Amy: Sudden loss leads to other losses Dear Amy:\\n\\nI enjoyed the question from 'Tired,' who wondered how to get guests to leave at the end of an evening.\\n\\nMy grandfather had a saying that he would invoke when he got tired.\\n\\nHe would say, 'Let's go to bed now so these nice people can go home.'\\n\\n\\u2013 Lisa\\n\\nDear Lisa:\\n\\nBeautiful.\\n\\n(You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy, P.O.

She was born in Logan Utah on May 29, 1958 to Willard Alton Hansen Jr and Mary Lucinda Munk.\\n\\n\\nNancy grew up in Cache Valley, moving from Logan to Smithfield where she helped work on her family's farm. In her high school years, Nancy was a baton twirler. She was always happy to pull out her baton, which she kept far into her life, and put on a show even later in her life.\\n\\n\\nAs a young woman, Nancy married Tab Clint Nielsen and had 5 children: Tyler, Bryan John (BJ), Lisa, Landon, and Jessie. They were together for 18 years. After which, Nancy married Leslie (Les) Lane, who had two sons Pat Peralo and Tony Peralo. Nancy and Les enjoyed many years together until Les passed away in 2022.\\n\\n\\nThroughout her life, Nancy had a passion for photography. She would go into nature and capture its beauty through her lens. With photos of landscapes and wildlife, Nancy had an extraordinary talent for encapsulating the essence of the outdoors in her photographs. Her work memorialized countless family excursions and stands as physical reminders of the cherished moments she shared with loved ones.\\n\\n\\nNancy embodied compassion, always seeking opportunities to extend kindness to those around her. Throughout various chapters of her life, she offered support to those unable to care for themselves, tending to them in their twilight years to ensure they received companionship. Whether the need was great or small, Nancy approached every opportunity with an eagerness to contribute, with a smile on her face and love in her heart.\\n\\n\\nEducation was also important to Nancy. She put her education on hold when she started a family so she could focus on caring for her children and spouse. Later in life she was able to return to school and graduated with a bachelor's degree from Brigham Young University \\u2013 Idaho.\\u00a0 Nancy also was an avid world traveler. Throughout her life she visited England, Ukraine, Italy, Mexico, and Brazil. She spoke often about how each of these experiences resonated with her and how grateful she was to see the different cultures around the world. She loved learning about each new place and was eager to continue traveling.\\n\\n\\nNancy is survived by: 4 siblings Cathy (Bob) Whitely, Mary Jo (Doug) Hansen, Debbie (John) Erickson, and Alton (Lisa) Hansen; 5 children Tyler (Rachel) Nielsen \\u2013 Longmont CO, Bryan John (Tiffany) Nielsen \\u2013 Brighton CO, Lisa (Moroni) Bento Rodrigues \\u2013 McKinney TX, Landon Nielsen \\u2013 Salt Lake City UT, Jessie Nielsen \\u2013 Garland TX; 7 Grandchildren: Jordanna, Caiden, Gavin, Gracie, Noah, Khloe, & Julia;\\n\\n\\nShe was preceded in death by her husband Les Lane, Mother, & Father.\\n\\n\\nFuneral services will be held on Friday, Feb 2, 2024 at 9:30 located at the Rexburg Idaho Center Stake Building 590 Summerwood Dr, Rexburg, ID 83440 and a graveside service on Saturday, Feb 3, 2024 at 10:00 am located at Smithfield City Cemetery 300 E Center St, Smithfield, UT 84335.\\n\\n\\nFuneral Services will be live streamed: Passcode: 440788\\n\\n\\nhttps://us02web.zoom.us/j/88349077263?pwd=dDcxbjBtekNNckhPYXphNS9nSGE1UT09\\n\\n\\nCondolences and memories may be shared with the family at \\nNelson Funeral Home.\\n \\n \\n \\nWould you like to have the day's news stories delivered right to your inbox every evening?

      "            \"summary\": \"On Tuesday night, LGBTQ advocates gathered at Town Hall Collaborative, a Denver community space and bar, for the 'Legislative Kickoff' of One Colorado, the state's leading organization for LGBTQ rights.\\n \\n\\n\\nBridges.\\n \\n'We don't want to be reactive anymore, we have to be proactive,' said Nadine Bridges, Executive Director of One Colorado, during the event.\\u00a0\\n \\n'Right now, in 2024, and we're not even at the end of January, we have over 329 anti-LGBTQ bills according to the ACLU,' Bridges said. 'It is unbelievable. Right here in the state of Colorado, we have 12 anti-LGBTQ initiatives happening: eight parental rights, and four anti-trans sports initiatives.'\\n \\n\\n\\nTitone.\\n \\nState Rep. Brianna Titone (D-Arvada) spoke of her own sense of fatigue, as hundreds of similar bills have been introduced each year \\nsince 2020\\n. In 2023 alone, 510 anti-LGBTQ bills were introduced across the country, shattering the record set by 2022. 2024 seems likely to follow that trend.\\n \\n'I look at the news, I follow Erin Reed,' Titone said, referencing trans journalist Erin Reed's project to track all anti-LGBTQ legislation across the country. 'She is always telling us about all the anti-trans stuff and, you know, we're lucky that we have her to keep track of all this stuff and listen to all the hearings to tell us all the things that are happening. Because it's hard listening to all those things happening all the time.'\\n \\nOne upcoming attack on LGBTQ liberties may be coming directly from the Colorado Republican Party. Earlier this month, Darcy Schoening, formerly a co-chair of the El Paso County Moms for Liberty chapter, announced she had joined the state GOP as Director of Special Initiatives, and that the party would run a ballot initiative to ban gender-affirming care for minors in Colorado. Schoening also mentioned that the initiative was backed by Matt Walsh, \\na national far-right pundit\\n known primarily for his inflammatory stances on LGBTQ people.\\n \\n\\n\\nScreenshot of Darcy Schoening discussing a ballot initiative to ban 'gender reassignment medical procedures.'\\n \\n'All of us, and everyone looking online here, make sure that you are doing your part,' Titone continued. 'That's something we can all do. I'm not going to see all those people peddling those petitions, but we all can keep an eye out for them, and when we find those bad petitions out there, and call them out for what they are, and let people know, \\u2018That's a bad petition, don't sign it.''\\n \\nEach speaker talked at length about plans to advance LGBTQ rights in Colorado during the 2024 session and beyond.\\u00a0\\n \\nBridges referenced U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas' statement, made following the fall of \\nRoe v. Wade\\n in 2022, that the same precedent could be used to take down \\nObergefell v. Hodges\\n, which guarantees marriage equality for same-sex couples. While Colorado leans strongly blue now, that wasn't always the case, and an older amendment could jeopardize some gay marriages in the state if \\nObergefell\\n falls.\\n \\n'In the state of Colorado we have Amendment 43,' Bridges explained to the audience. '\\u2026 Amendment 43 basically says that marriage is between one man and one woman. If Obergefell falls, what would happen is that in this state, marriage would no longer be legal for same-sex marriages. If you are already married because of the Respect for Marriage Act, you can stay married, but if you are not married, there's a whole lot of issues.'\\n \\nBridges referenced a potential ballot measure by One Colorado, currently in the works for 2024, that could rectify this.\\n \\nMore potential legislation for 2024 was discussed: Titone mentioned that state Rep. Lorena Garcia (D-Westminster) was working on a bill that would allow trans people with felonies to have their legal names changed, as well as another bill by herself and Stephanie Vigil (D-Colorado Springs) providing for non-legal name changes for students in Colorado schools.\\n \\n'If Elon Musk just changed the name of the company that he bought, he wants everybody to call it that,' Titone quipped, '\\u2026 It's not Twitter, now we have to call it X, because that's the right thing to do.'\\n \\nTitone said Vigil was also introducing a bill to hold a study on gender-affirming care in Colorado \\u2013 concerning both longtime residents, and those who fled to Colorado following the passage of anti-trans bills in their own states.\\n \\n\\n\\nVelasco\\n \\nElizabeth Velasco (D-Glenwood Springs) spoke to the crowd on an intersectional awareness of how issues like pollution and the current migrant crisis impacting Denver also impact the LGBTQ community. Velasco also teased two bills: one that would allow students more freedom in what they wear during their graduation ceremonies, and another that would streamline the state's migrant crisis response to be more like the process for asylum seekers.\\u00a0\\n \\n'I've been fighting for access to clean air and clean water for all, and we know that that's an LGBTQ issue. I'm also the co-chair of the Latino caucus, and we have been very involved with the response to the migrant crisis. And we know that that's an LGBTQ issue. \\u2026 We have to realize that all our issues are intersectional, and we have to show up for each other.'\\n \\nMembers of the state Legislature's LGBTQ caucus in attendance included: state Reps. Titone, Velasco, Vigil, Jennifer Parenti (D-Longmont), and state Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis (D-Lafayette). Also attending, though not themselves part of the LGBTQ caucus, were state Reps. Bob Marshall (D-Highlands Ranch), Meghan Lukens (D-Eagle), and Tim Hernandez (D-Denver).\\n \\nThe event was streamed on Instagram, \\nand can be viewed here.\",\n",

For her senior capstone project, Baker decided to spread joy and awareness of different cultures in the Boulder County community.\\n \\nBaker titled her capstone project 'Diversipiction.' Her work focuses on working with Boulder County groups and events to advertise the event and to add an innovative lens to the project through art, youth involvement or small business, she said.\\u00a0\\n \\nBaker fits as many cultural events into her schedule as she can such as the Longmont Museum's first Tamale Fair in November and the Native American Heritage Celebration of Longmont.\\n \\nDuring the Dios de los Muertos celebration in Longmont, she added her love for film production to the mix. Baker took footage of the various events and interviewed an array of people from performers to patrons. She is in the process of creating a video of the event, she said.\\u00a0\\n \\nAs an African American student, she sought an internship with Rev. Glenda Strong Robinson \\u2014 a long-time Longmont resident who marched with Dr. Martin Luther King. Baker was invited to participate in this year's MLK celebration as a co-facilitator.\\u00a0\\n \\nIn February, she will organize an art exhibit that will gather 'Draw the Dragon' art pieces from across SVVSD. She is hoping that students of all ages will take the time to research the Lunar New Year and contribute their interpretation of a dragon in a drawing. The drawings will be entered into a competition on Feb. 24.\\n \\n'I feel that St. Vrain has very strong artistic cultures \\u2026 I really wanted to showcase how amazing the kids are at various age levels,' Baker said.\\u00a0\\n \\nBaker has always loved exploring other cultures.

She doesn't know yet what she wants to do in the future. She is considering international relations, global policies, architecture, marine biology and many other things all with a minor in film and media studies.

      "            \"summary\": \"When Longmont resident Katrina Miller moved to Boulder in the early 2000s she was excited to start a new chapter in her life. She had enrolled at the University of Colorado-Boulder and was ready to pursue her education. The thing she had not prepared for was being one of the few Black people on campus. The experience, shared by many other people of color, inspired her and her cohorts to understand the lack of diversity in Boulder County by making the film 'This is [Not] Who We Are.'\\n \\nThe film premiered in 2022 at the Boulder International Film Festival. The documentary was co-produced and directed by Miller and Beret Strong with editing by John Tweedy. It explores the \\\"gap between Boulder's self-image and the more complex lived experiences\\u00a0\\u2014 both historical and contemporary\\u00a0\\u2014 of its Black citizens,\\\" according to the film's synopsis.\\n \\n'We are all long-time Boulder residents. We all went to CU. And living in this community for the white members of my film team, they noticed that the community isn't as diverse as they would like the Boulder County community to be,' Miller said.\\n \\n'We began this project almost exactly three years ago, just before Boulder police profiled Naropa student Zayd Atkinson,' said Strong, a white filmmaker and long-time Boulder resident.\\u00a0 'I realized I knew very little about Boulder's Black community. And though I have made films set in Micronesia, Latin America, and Africa, I had never made a film that addressed issues in my hometown.'\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n \\nAtkinson was picking up trash around his dorm as part of his work-study job when police approached him. Six officers surrounded Atkinson because they didn't believe he belonged there.\\n \\nWanting to see a difference the team began researching what it is that keeps Boulder County from inviting in more diverse backgrounds of people. Miller lent her own lived experience to the project.\\u00a0\\n \\nWhen Miller attended CU Boulder in the early 2000s it was ranked as the second whitest university in the nation, she said.\\n \\n'Issues of inequity and systemic racism became more prevalent and more prominent and just so more easily to notice when I moved here, where I didn't really notice it before,' Miller said. 'The hope in making this film was to bring awareness to the fact that there is still inequity going on in Boulder. We need to shatter this myth that Boulder is so progressive and liberal and that it is doing everything right in those areas because there is still work to do.'\\u00a0\\u00a0\\n \\nAtkinson's experience is only one of many stories shared in 'This is [Not] Who We Are.' Miller said the film crew approached Black community members throughout Boulder County to share their own lived experiences.\\u00a0\\n \\n'It feels like everybody has a story. In listening to these stories it makes the film more accessible \\u2014 I believe \\u2014 because it's hard to deny someone's actual lived experience,' Miller said. 'A little girl was talking about her fear at school. You can't deny her her fear because that is something that is actually happening. So to have the audience see some of a variety of what people of color go through here was really the method of explaining what is going on in Boulder.'\\n \\nThe film also takes a look at 150 years of local history and how that set the tone for the racial climate in Boulder County.\\u00a0\\n \\nMiller said the film has had an excellent impact on the community. It has been used in schools, museums and other venues to talk about racial concepts such as equity, oppression and true allyship. The film has been widely accepted and screened in Boulder but has been left out of the conversation in Longmont, although the film team all reside in Longmont now.\\n \\nThe Light of Christ EEC, located at 1000 15th Ave. in Longmont, will host a screening of the movie on Feb. 10 at 2 p.m. Another screening will shown at Front Range Community College Boulder County Campus on Feb. 22 in the Community Room at noon.\",\n",

Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination, had called on Ziegler to resign in November. \\n\\n\\nThe Sarasota police said on Friday that Ziegler had used his cellphone to record the sexual encounter during which the alleged rape occurred.\\n\\n\\n'The video showed that the encounter was likely consensual,' police said. 'Therefore, detectives were unable to develop probable cause to charge Ziegler with sexual battery.' \\n\\n\\nZiegler's accuser, however, told police she did not know she was being filmed, leading them to file a 'probable cause affidavit for the felony crime of Video Voyeurism against Christian Ziegler,' the statement said. \\n\\n\\nThe scandal has also embroiled Ziegler's wife, Bridget, a Sarasota School Board member who co-founded the conservative parents-rights group Moms for Liberty and has advocated against teaching young children about gender and sexuality issues.\\n\\n\\nNo criminal accusations have been lodged against her.\\n\\n\\n (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; Editing by Edmund Klamann)\\n\\n\\nBrought to you by \\nwww.srnnews.com\",\n",

Jan. 24, the Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC held its second annual State of the Chamber to highlight trends that impacted the business landscape in 2023 and celebrate the Chamber & EDC accomplishments for the past year. The UCCS College Business also shared important data that define growth, commerce, and economic development in the Pikes Peak Region.\\nColorado Springs economic experts tell FOX21 that the number one challenge the city is currently facing is growing pains. In the last five years, El Paso County grew nearly 7% making it the most populous county in Colorado. State projections show Colorado Springs is expected to surpass Denver's population by 2050. The Colorado Springs Chamber said with growth comes housing challenges, both supply and cost.\\n'I think the state of the economy is strong, but it's no different than anywhere in the country at this point,' Johnna Reeder Kleymeyer, President & CEO, of Colorado Springs Chamber & EDC said. 'We're facing inflationary challenges, we're facing workforce challenges. Any growing community is facing talent gaps.'\\nIn 2023, Colorado Springs became the permanent home of the U.S. Space Command. The city also launched the Titans of Economic Development Campaign and Council and has raised $5 million to assist in economic development efforts. Colorado Springs also closed deals on nine economic development projects, creating 2,200 high-paying jobs and more than $1.3 billion in capital investments.\\n'Talent wants to be in our region, it's a great place to live, to work, and to play,' Reeder Kleymeyer explained. 'Where talent goes, business goes.'\\nAs Colorado Springs continues to grow, economic experts are working to ensure there is enough affordable and attainable housing for all.\\n'Our challenges are all about our growing pains,' Reeder Kleymeyer said.\\nExperts said while the city experiences growing pains, they are also celebrating success.\\n'We're doing quite a bit of infill in some of our old buildings or in old parts of town that had unused infrastructure, buildings, utilities, and that's how we create a greater tax base,' Reeder Kleymeyer explained. 'None of us want to see our taxes increased, but we all want good services'\\nDr. Bill Craighead, the Program Director of the University of Colorado Colorado Springs was at Wed. (1/24) the State of the Chamber and presented data on building permits in the Pikes Peak Region.\\n'We did see a surge in building permits in 2021 and 2022, which will help with the supply situation, but with higher interest rates last year and 2023 permitting fell back,' Craighead explained. 'One of the key questions to watch going forward will be, you know, as interest rates start to fall, do we have more building permits that will refill that building pipeline.'\\nFOX21 asked the chamber about new jobs coming to the region in 2024, while they couldn't give us any specifics, they said some announcements are coming in the future.\",\n",

He highlighted both the successes and shortcomings of the city's efforts in sheltering the homeless population during the frigid weather.\\nOver 900 people were sheltered during the weekend of Jan. 12- 15 when temperatures plummeted below zero. The Mayor praised efforts from the city, shelters, and non-profits for saving 'lives and limbs.'\\nThe Colorado Springs Police Department (CSPD) and the El Paso Coroner's Office reported one fatality during the freezing weekend, an individual believed to be part of the homeless community.\\nLocal shelters including Springs Rescue Mission and Salvation Army took in 505 individuals. Several local churches, including Sanctuary Church, First United Methodist Church, and Vista Grande Baptist Church, collaborated with Hope COS, to open their doors, welcoming 403 individuals.\\nSome church locations reached capacity, leading to the unfortunate necessity of turning people away.\\nMobolade reported that Springs Rescue Mission was at 93% capacity and could have accommodated the overflow, however many people thought it wasn't an option because the shelter banned them. Yet, he attributed the shortcomings to miscommunication emphasizing that during emergency shelter declarations, the Springs Rescue Mission takes in everyone, regardless of whether they are banned or not.\\n'Because of that confusion, Hope COS was bearing the burden of a lot more residents that needed help than they could actually carry, hence they had to turn some people away,' said Mobolade.\\nHe said plans are underway to provide clearer communication in the future to prevent such misunderstandings.\\n'We've acknowledged that there's room for improvement, and so I have asked for a briefing and a corrective action plan so that we are learning from our previous experience what worked and what we can do better,' said Mobolade.\\nLooking ahead, Mayor Mobolade said the cold snap highlighted the need for additional behavioral health services for the vulnerable homeless population. He said the 2024 budget has been augmented to include funding for fire departments and community and public health programs, ensuring support for homeless residents to expand opportunities for those in need.\\nWhile Colorado Springs is not a direct provider of homeless services, Mayor Mobolade revealed that the city spent approximately $27,000 in emergency response during the extreme weather. He commended the collaborative effort involving the fire department's homeless outreach program, the police department outreach team, the Pikes Peak Regional Office of Emergency Management, and Mountain Metro Bus Drivers.\\nAcknowledging the support from various city entities, Mayor Mobolade expressed gratitude to the Public Works Department for maintaining safe roads and Colorado Springs Utilities for restoring power to more than 3,200 affected customers and assisting those with burst water pipes.\\nMayor Mobolade underscored the effectiveness of pre-planning, emphasizing the significant impact of a plan crafted last year and implemented this year by the Colorado Springs Fire Department, which he said played a crucial role in saving lives.\\n'The key is to ensure that we're prepared\\u2026 The key and that we are coordinated alongside agencies,' said Mobolade.\",\n",

The Colorado Springs Horticultural Art Society teamed up with SavATree to make sure the tree is healthy.\\nThe elm is located in the Heritage Garden and is as old as Monument Valley Park itself. It was planted in front of the historic Van Briggle Pottery building, in the southern part of the park, and it has grown a lot since 1907.\\nThis elm is a survivor. In the 1935 Memorial Day Flood, Monument Creek flooded, uprooting many trees, destroying over 70 homes, and killing 6 people. Also, beginning in 1930, a Dutch elm disease killed most of the elms in the United States. The tree lived through both disasters, earning it a place on Colorado's 'Notable Trees' list.\\nAccording to the Horticultural Art Society of Colorado Springs, the elm was last officially measured in 2007. At that time, it was 50 feet tall and its trunk measured a diameter of 49 inches.\\nSavATree visited the notable American Elm from 10:00 a.m. to 1:00 p.m. on Jan. 26. They pruned it, and practiced an aerial rescue. The entire SavATree team was present for the event, despite the snowy conditions.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"(COLORADO SPRINGS) \\u2014 The Local Honey Collective is getting ready for what they hope will be a busy weekend, one that will help keep the business on its feet. After a fire struck in December in Downtown Colorado Springs, this boutique along with the other businesses in the Majestic Building were forced to close their doors to customers due to smoke damage.\\n'We really just are in a little bit of a financial pickle after the fire to say it lightly,' said Co-owner of The Local Honey Collective, Cara McQueeney. 'We are just trying to raise some funds so we can have some cash to keep going as a business and stay active in our community.'\\nThe other managing half to this store is Hailey Sardi, who explained how a friendship and shared dream brought the vision of The Local Honey Collective to life.\\n'Cara and I met at CSU up in Fort Collins in 2018\\u2026 and we ended up both moving up to the Springs and just weren't happy with what we were doing,' Sardi explained. 'The Springs is so big and we both just had this dream of having a space that we got to help women gather and a place to shop and come and meet each other.'\\nThe Local Honey Collective opened its doors in Downtown Colorado Springs in 2019, where the boutique persevered through the challenges of the pandemic. Beyond selling clothes for all to enjoy, the store also served as a space for special events to enhance its connection with the Southern Colorado community.\\n'Just having women and people gather in our space is just truly one of the most heart and joy feeling things, and so we miss that,' Sardi said. 'We want we want to be able to have people gather again.'\\nHaving to close their doors during the holiday season, the Downtown Development Authority announced a gift card mob to help support both The Local Honey Collective and its neighbor Yobel with sales.\\n\\n'We are so grateful for the community and the support that we received during that time,' McQueeney said. 'That did help a lot, but yeah, just still need a lot more finances to keep going and so this is the next step to get all of our inventory that was damaged in this with the smoke from the fire, to get that out of our door and get a new inventory in.'\\nOn Friday afternoon, several people tried to look into the boutique only to realize there was barely anything inside. The Local Honey Collective is not the only one with a shuttered business, as their neighbors were also forced to close from the damage of the fire.\\n'When you come downtown Colorado Springs, it's a different experience than you'll have anywhere else and it's local businesses and local owners like these guys that really give it the personality,' said Director of Marketing and Communications for the Downtown Partnership of Colorado Springs, Carrie Simison.\\nEven though their doors bear closed signs, Simison is hopeful that the Southern Colorado community will come to appreciate the significant impact of supporting local businesses.\\n'I mean, it's so easy to go online, but you get no benefit to your community by that,' Simison said. 'When you shop local, at least $0.70 from every dollar stays in the community and it doesn't just stay here, then the taxes that you pay help for the roads, they help education, like shopping local means so much more than just buying something out of business, it really does help our community thrive'\\nNow rows of clothes are inside of the Meanwhile Block, sorted by gender, age, and size for customers to pick out and purchase. A sign above the check out area provides recommendations for customers on removing any smoke smell the item may have.\\n'We are really grateful all of the smoke can be removed from the product that you're buying,' McQueeney said. 'A lot of the restoration companies that we talked to assured us that the smoke can come out. That is the only reason we're not able to sell it at full price is because we would have to wash it first, so we're just letting you guys do the washing it will come out with in two or three washes.'\\nStickers appear by the price tag indicating the cost of the product ranging from $5 to $60 depending on the item. Looking ahead to the warmer months, the co-owners hope to sell current inventory to help with purchasing new clothes.\\n'If we could get rid of everything that would be amazing,' Sardi said. 'Our goal is to get rid of it so that we can then have cash flow to purchase new inventory to keep going for summer, spring, all of that.'\\nThe sale will be held on Jan. 27 from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and will also be on Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., located at 425 South Sierra Madre Street in Colorado Springs. Details can also be found on their social media page, which can be found here.\\nAlthough the future remains uncertain, the co-owners are staying optimistic of keeping a storefront in Colorado Springs. For now, having support from the community serves as a main inspiration for staying in business.\\n'We are just really holding on to that this is happening for a reason and there's a greater purpose and we just have to continue to remind ourselves that we will get to the other side and see a reason and just have to stay positive with each step,' McQueeney said. 'It's hard, but we are just able to lean on each other, which we're really grateful for and the community too, has just been incredible throughout this.\\u00a0'\",\n",

The now-removed video was titled 'From Colorado Springs to Denver in 20 Minutes,' and is now in the hands of Colorado prosecutors. The man is facing several charges, including reckless endangerment, according to a 9 News report.\\nThe speeding motorcyclist has been identified as Rendon Dietzmann, according to police. Dietzmann is a 32-year-old man from Texas. The viral video that got him in hot water was filmed on Interstate 25 between Colorado Springs and Denver. It appears to show him reaching speeds of over 170 mph along the way.\\nHis arrest warrant contains seven charges which are: menacing, engaging in a speed contest, reckless endangerment, reckless driving, speeding 40 mph over prima facie limit, engaging in an exhibition of speed, and vehicle having no number plates attached.\\nThe last charge is interesting. There were no number plates attached, presumably to make Dietzmann harder to track down. But then he allegedly uploads a video of himself speeding at over 170 mph on his YouTube channel.\\nColorado State Patrol worked with investigators in Dallas to track the video back to Dietzmann.\\n'Illegal and reckless driving behavior will not be tolerated in Colorado,' stated Colorado State Patrol sergeant Troy Kessler.\\nDietzmann is known as Gixxer Brah on YouTube and Instagram. His posts on both platforms are full of bike stunts and high-speed runs. Both accounts remain active with his most recent YouTube video uploaded just two days ago. His riding skills are impressive, and we all can appreciate the thrill of speed. However, traveling at these speeds on a crowded interstate and then posting the illegal activity online is not wise.\",\n",

It is a national emergency and it's destroying cities and communities around our nation,' said Carrie Geitner,\\u00a0El Paso County Commissioner District\\u00a02.\\nSome communities, most notably Denver, have taken a welcoming stance towards migrants and are currently offering them sanctuary.\\n'They need to really think seriously about what they're doing with regard to that $180 million cost or whatever it ultimately will be,' said Stan VanderWerf, El Paso County Commissioner District 3.

We're not in the business of selling dreams that can't be fulfilled. Offering sanctuary or support beyond our capabilities is a dangerous game and risks the safety of both migrants and our citizens,' Geitner said.\\nCommissioners also said it diverts resources away from the homeless population.\\n'I cannot believe that we have individuals coming across the border who are being placed in the hotels,' said Holly Williams, El Paso County Commissioner District 1, 'compared to someone who goes to a soup kitchen or to the rescue mission to get food or who has to find shelter on a cold night.'\\nOn Wednesday, Jan. 31, El Paso County Commissioners, along with members of Colorado Springs City Council, said they are taking a stand against the national migrant crisis, and they are declaring El Paso County, along with the city of Colorado Springs, not a sanctuary.\\nIn a press release from the Mayor's office, Colorado Springs Mayor Yemi Mobolade said, 'We will not invite this crisis into our city and we are not a sanctuary city. It's the City's duty to care for its residents first, and that remains our top priority. While we are called to serve and help those in need, as Mayor I will act as a thoughtful and careful steward of our taxpayer dollars. We must use these limited resources in support of and in service to our own residents first.'\",\n",

'We are committed to cultivating a positive outdoor experience while also preserving and maintaining the surrounding natural areas. The formalization of the lot will also reduce the amount of vehicles parking in native areas, which will enhance and protect the sensitive environment.'\\nAnyone planning to recreate at Austin Bluffs Open Space should be aware that a portion of the Austin Bluffs Regional Trail will be closed during this project due to construction activity. The North Austin Bluffs Open Space/North Pulpit Rock Trailhead located at 6411 North Nevada Avenue will remain open and available to the public during this time.\\nPhase one of the project begins the week of Jan. 29, and will include earthwork to create a level gravel parking area that will provide approximately 55 to 60 spaces. This formal, expanded trailhead is made possible thanks to UCCS for its easement donation to the City of Colorado Springs.\\nAs part of phase one, the City said park staff will also install a trail map, kiosk, and other amenities. Phase two of construction\\u00a0will include a paved parking lot with a total of 100 parking stalls, a trailhead plaza, and drainage improvements. Final implementation is subject to available funding.\\nYou can follow the project and any updates on the City's project website.\\nThe current lot will temporarily close beginning Monday, Feb. 5. Weather dependent, the parking lot will be opened to the public by the end\\u00a0of February with the remaining work wrapping up at the trailhead by April, the City said.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"(COLORADO SPRINGS) \\u2014 As we head into 2024, affordable housing continues to pose serious problems for Coloradans. On Friday, Jan. 12, FOX21  spoke with Mayor Yemi Mobolade to get his perspective on what's causing our local housing crisis\\u2014and how we can start fixing it.\\nThe Mayor mentioned three things he sees contributing to the current housing crisis in Colorado Springs: the shortage of affordable housing for middle-income earners, bad legislation that is causing contractors to shy away from building affordable housing, and regulatory barriers to housing development that slow down the process.\\n'Believe it or not, folks that make between $50,000 to $120,000\\u2014that's where we're having a hard time with housing,' the Mayor said.\\nMayor Mobolade referenced the Colorado Construction Defect Action Reform Act (CDARA), which his administration has championed. CDARA was created to curb legislation that allows for frivolous construction lawsuits over 'construction defects' in common interest communities, i.e. condominiums and apartment complexes.\\n'Construction defects' are defined as issues with the construction or repair, or the design of a construction project. These lawsuits can be brought against any construction professional, including architects, contractors, subcontractors, developers, builders, engineers, inspectors and more.\\nAccording to the Mayor, the problem is that since this legislation applies only to condos and apartment complexes, construction professionals are (understandably) avoiding those projects to avoid lawsuits.\\n'Long story short,' Mayor Mobolade said, 'this bad legislation prevents builders from building condos. They get sued, so they virtually stop building condos. And those condos are our entry-level homes. We don't even have starter homes for people.'\\nThe Mayor said that a couple of bills will be submitted this session to address the issue. His administration is also preparing to tackle regulations he referred to as 'barriers' which are causing delays to the construction of affordable homes in Colorado Springs.\\n'At the city level, I intend to remove barriers around housing development and to accelerate those developments as quickly as possible,' he said.\",\n",

Doug Hanson,' he said. 'That they had received 21 migrants.'\\nHanson confirmed that information in an interview with FOX21  on Thursday. It was assumed the migrants had been dropped off, and migrant testimony revealed at least some of them had come from Denver.\\n'The numbers started to get\\u2026 to a point where maybe we were a little concerned or wanted the city to know,' Hanson said. 'We just made them aware.'\\nFrom there, Mayor Mobolade said, concerns began spreading quickly across Colorado Springs.\\n'That's really important for residents to know that we're not in a crisis situation,' he stated. 'Neither am I advocating that I want a crisis in our city.'\\nOn Wednesday, El Paso County Commissioners took a stand against being a sanctuary county, and Mayor Mobolade echoed that in a statement that same day.\\n\\n'It's also not my intent that we become a sanctuary city,' he said.\\nMayor Mobolade added, it doesn't mean Colorado Springs should not prepare.\\n'We don't wait for a fire to come into our city and then decide how to respond,' he said. 'What I've done, rather, is to activate our Pikes Peak Office of Emergency Management to start to play out different kinds of scenarios.'\\nIn his address to the community, he also stated his support to local nonprofits in the community.\\n'Many of these public servants have signed up to just caring for the what I call the \\u2018least of these',' Mobolade said.\\nThe Salvation Army said when the migrants came, they didn't ask questions.\\n'It's really just a mom, a family coming to our door, asking at night \\u2014 \\u2018Hey, can I have a place to stay?' And if we have space, we certainly welcome them in and make sure they have a warm, hot meal and a warm bed,' Hanson said.\\nAt the end of the day, the Salvation Army said they and their community partners are all on the same team.\\n'We've been a great community partner for our 135 year history here in El Paso County, and we'll continue to do that collaboratively, working with other nonprofits and with the county and city,' Hanson said.\\nFinally, as an immigrant himself, Mayor Moboalde acknowledged the migrants are looking for their own version of the American Dream, and better opportunities.\\n'Hence, the federal government needs to step up and ensure that\\u2026 we're not just taking care of the crisis, but perhaps we can be proactive and also in helping these families that are looking for help and opportunity.'\",\n",

During the search, investigators located more than 4 kilograms of heroin.\\nFederal charges were unsealed Wednesday against five individuals for their alleged role in a conspiracy to distribute, and possess to distribute methamphetamine, fentanyl, heroin, and cocaine.\\nThree of those individuals made their initial appearance in federal court Wednesday, including Alex LNU, a.k.a. Miguel Angel Gonzalez (formally identified as Alonso Quinonez-Velazquez), Fidel LNU (formally identified as Roberto Gutierrez), and Francisco LNU (formally identified as Luis Saucedo-Bonilla).\\nAdditionally, Adan Trevizo was charged by criminal complaint with possession with intent to distribute 1 kilogram or more of a mixture of substance containing a detectable amount of heroin.\\nThe two others charged are fugitives and were not named in the Wednesday news release.\\n'Together with our law enforcement partners, we are removing dangerous drugs from our communities,' U.S. Attorney Cole Finegan said in the release. 'We are grateful for the continued dedication and hard work of our law enforcement partners who are protecting our communities from drug trafficking.'\\nThe operation required a huge effort from multiple agencies, according to Drug Enforcement Administration Rocky Mountain Field Division Acting Special Agent in Charge David Olesky.\\n'Yesterday's enforcement actions involved over 150 members from Southern Colorado law enforcement agencies,' Olesky said. 'Fentanyl is continuing to gravely impact Southern Colorado. Collectively, Colorado law enforcement agencies are prioritizing investigative efforts to decrease the fentanyl supply and prevent fentanyl poisonings in our communities.'\\nPueblo County Sheriff David Lucero praised the teamwork between federal and local law enforcement to make the arrests possible. 'This is just another great example of our local law enforcement working with our federal partners to combat illicit drugs in our community,\\\" Lucero said. \\\"The Pueblo County Sheriff's Office is proud to have two task force detectives assigned to the DEA. Even though this unit is not highly publicized, they are having a positive impact on this community in reducing the distribution of illegal drugs.\\\"\\nThis investigation was conducted by the DEA, Homeland Security Investigations, the Department of Homeland Security Enforcement & Removal Operations, the FBI, the U.S Marshals Service, the Colorado Springs Police Department, the Pueblo Police Department, the El Paso County Sheriff's Office, the Pueblo County Sheriff's Office, and the Colorado State Patrol, according to the release.\\nAll suspects are innocent until proven guilty in court.

      "            \"summary\": \"The Colorado Buffaloes took a huge step forward regarding its offensive production in 2023, but head coach Deion Sanders' team will need to do it again if CU wants to make a run at the Big 12 title.\\nThe Buffaloes have added several talented players on the offensive side of the ball this offseason, ranging from impact linemen such as Justin Mayers to explosive wide receivers like Will Sheppard. But we need to dive deeper because Colorado also needs some guys who are possibly flying under the radar to take a jump.\\nLet's examine five offensive players who could enjoy a breakout season in 2024:\\nTurn on the second-half highlights of the USC game last year and you will see lots of No. 14 Omarion Miller. Miller exploded for seven catches, 196 yards and a touchdown after he was forced into action. Now, with the departures of Javon Antonio and Xavier Weaver, an opening is there for Miller to compete for playing time at wide receiver.\\nEvery great offense needs a great tight end, and CU picked up an intriguing player in Cincinnati transfer Chamon Metayer. Metayer has excellent athleticism and size for the position and should give quarterback Shedeur Sanders a receiving threat over the middle that he lacked last season.\\nCan you name Colorado's starting tight end from last year's spring game? Louis Passarello looked like a breakout candidate last season when he was named the spring starter but unfortunately, he suffered a knee injury that cost him the entire 2023 season. We'll see if he can recapture the magic from last spring and earn himself some playing time.\\nCan a former freshman All-American be considered a breakout candidate? Of course, he can, especially given how difficult the past two seasons were for McCaskill. After an electric 2021 season at Houston, McCaskill tore his ACL and missed the entire 2022 season before transferring to CU. While struggling to find playing time, McCaskill took a redshirt last year and is now in line to share the load with Dylan Edwards.\\nI am cheating here a little because just about everyone believes Jordan Seaton will be a superstar at Colorado, including myself. But Seaton still must prove himself at the college level to live up to the hype. The massive offensive tackle from IMG Academy in Florida has an opportunity to become one of the greatest linemen in CU history.\\n\\nContact/Follow us\\u00a0@BuffaloesWire\\u00a0on X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook\\u00a0to follow ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\",\n",

If pedestrians or motorists do pass through the area, Springs Utilities encourages caution when proceeding through the work zone.\\nThe Fontmore construction is part of a larger initiative called the Mesa to Manitou Project, which endeavors to install a 'high priority' natural gas distribution main along five miles between Mesa Road and Manitou Springs. The construction on Fontmore Road is expected to persist through April.\",\n",

All the graduates have college experience, including three who hold Master's degrees. 15 graduates have served, or currently serve, in the Armed Forces.\\nMayor Yemi Mobolade, who has been vocal in his support for CSPD, spoke at the graduation, saying, 'Today is a day of celebration and achievement as we gather to recognize the dedication and hard work of the women and men who have completed their training and are ready to begin their noble calling as members of the Colorado Springs Police Department.'\\nThe Mayor called law enforcement the highest of all callings, one which requires 'courage, empathy, humility, integrity, and an unwavering commitment to confront danger, protect and serve our community.'\\n'As you step into this role,' the Mayor told graduates. 'You become the guardians of justice, the advocates of peace, and the reassuring presence in times of crisis.

CDOT wants to give law enforcement the necessary advanced skills to recognize impaired drivers.\\nThe Colorado DRE program has been in existence since 1987, and exists to help law enforcement officers recognize drivers who are impaired by drugs other than alcohol, or combinations of drugs and alcohol. Drug use evolves and changes from year to year, and it's important for officers to learn new trends.\\nAccording to data from 2022 on CDOT's website, 691 people died on Colorado roads in 2021, which was a 50% increase since 2011. Since 2019, the number of people killed in accidents involving an impaired driver has gone up 44%.\\nCDOT is responding to this trend by reaching out to the public, as well as law enforcement agencies, to increase awareness and training. As of 2022, Colorado's law enforcement agencies had 150 trained Drug Recognition Experts, and more will be trained as CDOT continues to offer the DRE certiticate program.

      "            \"summary\": \"(COLORADO SPRINGS) \\u2014 The Space Foundation in Colorado Springs highlighted the busiest year ever for space on Wednesday, Jan. 24. Not only does this mean new advancements in technology and science, but also a boon to the city's economy.\\nIn 2023, global launch activity broke new records for the third year in a row, with 223 launch attempts and 212 successful launches. The United States saw a 33% increase in launch attempts.\\n'The fascinating and exciting part about all of that is we see that trend continue to climb,' said Lesley Conn, director of research and digital programming for the Space Foundation.\\nCommercial space was the fastest growing sector in launch activity with an increase of 50% from 2022, sending more payload into space and providing more satellite and internet service to us on earth, including satellites that can deliver signals directly to a cell phone.\\n'There's so many exciting advancements on the cusp that are just beginning to grow and develop. That all spurs not only economic development, but job creation as well,' Conn said.\\nThese new devlopments impacted not just the Space Foundation, but other businesses in Colorado Springs.\\n'The aerospace and defense space sector is about 43% of our economy in the Pikes Peak region,' said Johnna Reeder Kleymeyer, president and CEO of the Colorado Springs Chamber and EDC. 'We'll be at a number of defense and space conferences this year starting with the space symposium that's brought to us by the Space Foundation yearly.'\\nWith exploration continuing in the final frontier, new developments are touching down right in our own backyard.\\n'The James Webb Space Telescope, for example \\u2014 the science that helped develop the lenses \\u2014 was directly correlated to improving Lasik surgery,' Conn said. 'The research that's done on the International Space Station, the medical and pharmaceutical research that has come out of that benefits all of us here on Earth.'\\nLooking to the future of the cosmos, the Space Foundation said they are shooting for the stars in 2024.\\n'The big thing to look for in 2024 is the debut of a number of launch vehicles,' Conn said. 'We'll be increasing the number of space stations that will increase the medical research, the microgravity research. And it will just continue to have a ripple effect on the global economy.'\\nAlso, the Space Discovery Center is boldly going where no museum has gone before, as it is currently under construction to bring new exhibits and expand the square footage of the building.\\nIts debut will be tied with the 2024 Space Symposium on April 8.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Only weeks after leading the Michigan Wolverines to a national championship, Jim Harbaugh is headed back to the NFL.\\nHarbaugh, who spent nine seasons in Ann Arbor, was named head coach of the Los Angeles Chargers on Wednesday evening. ESPN reported that Harbaugh's deal is for five years.\\nWith Harbaugh leaving the Wolverines, Michigan players, including class of 2024 early enrollees, now have a 30-day window to enter the transfer portal. Colorado still has some roster holes to fill and head coach Deion Sanders will almost certainly examine any Michigan players who become available.\\nBelow are five Wolverine players Colorado should target now that Harbaugh is gone:\\nWhile Chamon Metayer was an excellent addition, Colorado needs some more depth at the tight end position. Loveland was one of the best TEs in college football this past season, hauling in 649 receiving yards and four touchdowns.\\nLinebacker is another position that Colorado must solidify, and adding Hausmann would satisfy that need. A former Nebraska transfer, Hausmann recorded 46 total tackles and five TFLs for Michigan in 2023.\\nIf Colorado is serious about improving its run defense, Coach Prime must add some more depth to the Buffs' D-line, especially on the inside. The 318-pound Graham was an All-Big Ten DT in 2023 who would immediately bring size to the Buffaloes' front.\\nAfter an awesome visit and a great conversation with @k_dorrell and @coachmarksmith I am thankful to receive an offer from the University of Colorado. I enjoyed watching spring practice! @djbryant13 @CUBuffsFootball @CoachFilleman @RJHSFootball @emilygiusti @bangulo pic.twitter.com/hr8dryoj1d\\n\\u2014 Hayden Moore (@HMOORE3405) March 31, 2022\\nIt's time for the Buffs to bring this Colorado native home. Moore, who attended Regis Jesuit High School, didn't record any statistics as a freshman this past season but impressed on Michigan's defensive scout team.\\nIt started with belief. pic.twitter.com/GbyKVstW55\\n\\u2014 Connor Jones (@76ConnorJones) January 13, 2024\\nAnother Colorado high school product (Palmer Ridge), Jones is a 320-pound offensive lineman who didn't see much action in his first two seasons at Michigan. The Buffs could still benefit from some more depth on the O-line and Jones provides just that.\\n\\nContact/Follow us\\u00a0@BuffaloesWire\\u00a0on X (Twitter), and like our page on Facebook\\u00a0to follow ongoing coverage of Colorado news, notes and opinions.\",\n",

'The other dogs are dual-purpose dogs for apprehension or explosives, narcotics, whatever and the reason why we don't take that drive away to make them stay by our side is because we cast them out to search for the explosives and we allow them to pull us, to take us to the odor and not to stay back with us.'\\nFilled with a whole bunch of energy, this six-year-old German Shorthaired Pointer is always on alert, ensuring the safety of these frequent fliers. Her dedication and hard work earned her and Beichler a spot at last year's Super Bowl, where they provided the best security for the best teams in the league.\\nNow this duo is getting ready for round two. In less than two weeks, they will head to Allegiant Staidum in Las Vegas to provide security for the Super Bowl LVIII.\\n'Well, we're going to be searching everything, anything that comes and goes from the stadiums, from the hotel from any of the facilities that are out there, any of the transportation areas, the subways, buses, anything coming and going into the Super Bowl,' said Biechler.\\nWhile the two may be states away, their commitment to serving others remains a remarkable trait. In going to the big game, they will be joining other K9s and handlers who are on the same mission to ensure the event goes well.\\n'We are really just proud of the work that they do and that they are able to represent CSPD on this world-class level,' Ford said. 'It's just it's really great to be able to showcase what our department does every day at a national level.'\\nNo matter which jersey attendees wear, this dynamic duo is ready to work tirelessly to make sure all have a safe and memorable experience.\\n'I mean, it's excellent being there as far as keeping the community safe, keeping everything safe there, of course,' Biechler said. 'But also meeting a lot of the other dog teams from around the nation. But we stay busy, we work a lot. We work a lot of hours and we search a lot of stuff, just to make sure that nothing's able to go into that stadium.'\\nWhether she's guarding the world's largest stage or under the backdrop of Pikes Peak, Donut's sweetness is felt in her handler's heart. Officer Biechler said, 'I mean, she's been the best dog I've ever had.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Rural western Colorado rang in the new year with a howl.\\nFor the first time in U.S. history, a federally listed endangered species has been reintroduced to the wild by the efforts of a lone state. Wolves in Colorado were not a mandate from Washington, D.C.; Coloradans voted for them.\\nOne week before Christmas, gray wolves were unleashed on a Rocky Mountain mosaic of public lands, pine and aspen forests, private ranches and beloved recreation areas. Wolves now roam within the realm of world-famous ski areas. Some have already wandered through the creeks, peaks and woods near my cabin at the rural edge of Steamboat Springs, where rugged watersheds pour into the Yampa River's wide-open valley, flowing downstream from the Flat Tops Wilderness past cattle ranches, hay meadows, the towering Steamboat Ski Resort and historic downtown ski jumps.\\nIn the 2020 general election, a slim margin of Coloradans \\u2014 50.91% \\u2014 voted to reintroduce gray wolves to our ecosystem, back to a landscape from which they were exterminated nearly 80 years ago. Thirteen of 64 counties, mostly along the urban Front Range corridor east of the Continental Divide, were definitively supportive. But in the habitat where wolves will reside on Colorado's less populated, agricultural/recreational Western Slope, the \\\"yes\\\" vote was not as resounding.\\n\\nProposition 114 mandated a plan that would reintroduce wolves no later than Dec. 31, 2023. Thirteen days before that deadline, a small group of trucks climbed winding dirt roads through a remote corner of rural Grand County in northwest Colorado. The convoy's destination: a sliver of state-owned land surrounded by millions of acres of national forest.\\nGathering quietly were Gov. Jared Polis, First Gentleman Marlon Reis, a devoted Colorado Parks and Wildlife team and a few influential folks who helped bring about this effort. There was snow on the ground, but nothing daunting.\\n'It was so perfect. You could look around, and it felt like at any moment John Denver was going to show up. It was 'Rocky Mountain High' in every direction,' said Joanna Lambert, a wildlife ecology and conservation biology professor at University of Colorado Boulder and director of the American Canid Project. The stars rolled up last: five wolves, silent in their crates but omnipotent in the waft of their musky aroma. It smelled like the wild, Lambert observed.\\nOne at a time, crate doors were sprung, and powerful hind legs pushed off back walls to crash through the silence. Three grays and two blacks individually bolted into the forest.\\n\\nThis is a moment of pride for Colorado. Putting paws on the ground was a grassroots effort negotiated in the flames of conflict, compromise and invention. Within a week of the first release, another five wolves, exported from wild packs in Oregon, made their way onto Colorado's Western Slope, all mature enough to hunt prey on their own.\\nWolves maintain an outsize place in the collective imagination. They possess an unusual power to spark deep positive and negative beliefs. Ironically, decades after government-hired exterminators wiped them out, wolves have transformed into a symbol for anti-government sentiment.\\nIn truth, there is nuance in Coloradans' hearts and minds about this rewilding effort. With a new predator on the ground, ranchers understandably fear for their livelihoods, but coalitions of ranchers and hunters contributed mightily to crafting the reintroduction plan. In fact, local ranchers say they've been preparing for wolves since Yellowstone's reintroduction 29 years ago. And hunters watching scientific data of elk populations in Idaho know that hunts there are more fruitful than ever.\\n\\nEarth is suffering a biodiversity crisis, and returning wolves to wild places is a good starting point. Trophic cascade, the effect of an apex predator's presence improving habitat quality and species viability all the way down the food chain, is a prime motivation for wolf reintroduction. Colorado stands to be a model for what a state can do to repair its ecosystems. It will be a complicated, long-haul effort to turn tame landscapes wild again and build resilience for the future.\\n'We are still in the hangover era of the \\u2018frontier,' ' said range scientist and former ranch manager Matt Barnes. 'The last hundred years are the most abnormal periods of all human history in many, many ways, including this minor detail about not having wolves in most of the American West.'\\nOne month into this grand experiment, what a wonder it was to witness the first public GPS collar tracking map. Based on data from the Northern Rockies, elk will provide about 80% of the diet for Colorado wolves. And Colorado has a lot of elk, so wolves are unlikely to damage the elk hunt. Wolves aren't likely to fundamentally change ranching, either, because it is transforming for other reasons \\u2014 such as rotational grazing, cross fencing and virtual fencing so you no longer have to scatter your cattle over 10,000 acres.\\nChange is hard. But look what it can spark. The next likely candidate in Colorado's rewilding effort is the wolverine, the world's largest terrestrial weasel, which was federally listed as threatened under the Endangered Species Act in November 2023.\\nA bipartisan wolverine reintroduction bill is expected to be introduced in the Colorado state Legislature during the current session, which started Jan. 10. Changing times on a changing planet.\\nJennie Lay is a writer based in Routt County, Colo., and director of the Literary Sojourn festival of authors in Steamboat Springs. @mermaidonthemountain\\nIf it's in the news right now, the L.A.

Comstock was arrested earlier tin January on charges of criminally negligent child abuse resulting in death.\\nAccording to the court documents, in November 2022, the 14-month-old child was blue when he was found after being put down for a nap. Comstock allegedly admitted that she did not call 911 after discovering him unresponsive. One Colorado Springs Police officer on the scene that evening reported her saying, she 'knew this was all her fault.'\\nPREVIOUS COVERAGE: Arrest in 14-month-old toddler's death from 2022\\nThe Department of Human Services (DHS) reported an extended history of concerns dating back to 2016, listing Comstock as the perpetrator in several referrals. These referrals included neglect, injurious environment, admitted heroin use, substance exposure to a newborn, and physical abuse.\\nIn September 2021, a referral was made due to substance exposure to a newborn, around the time Comstock's 14-month-old son was born. Court documents reveal that Comstock disclosed her alleged heroin use to a doctor at that time but later denied it to others. In October of the same year, DHS conducted another assessment, noting concerns raised by a medical social worker who reported that Comstock would tune out her child by putting on headphones when he cried.\\nPrevious referrals from 2018 and 2016 detailed bruises and scrapes on the victim consistent with descriptions of how Comstock grabbed and threw the child on the ground. Comstock admitted to using heroin, injecting it through her veins, with at least one child experiencing withdrawal symptoms at birth in 2018. Court documents say Comstock had several positive urine analyses for heroin and tested positive for other opiates, during that birth.\\nDespite living in separate states, Tanya Perez and her husband James, who claim to be the closest people to Comstock, expressed shock at the allegations.\\nJames, who said he has been friends with Comstock for 15 years, said they vividly recall Comstock expressing depression and suicidal thoughts after her son's death. Tonya said she would try to check in on her regularly because she feared Comstock would harm herself. Up until her arrest, Comstock regularly posted on Facebook memorializing her deceased son.\\n'I've seen that picture of her in the mug shot, and my God, I had to really look at the picture\\u2026 She's not the girl I know,' James Perez said in disbelief that his close friend would ever commit a crime like this.\\nTwo days after the child's death, investigators contacted Comstock to address feeding concerns. Along with the baby's sippy cup, Comstock showed investigators the food and drinks she fed him, including 'Chef Boyardee Ravioli's, Skittles All Pink powdered drink mix, MiO water flavoring, Yoohoo Chocolate Drinks, Nestea Iced Tea and Watermelon Lemonade.'\\nThe El Paso County Coroner's Office ruled the child's death a homicide back in January 2023. In a police interview in February 2023, Comstock repeatedly denied knowledge of what happened regarding her child's death. She is currently held at the El Paso County Jail on a $250,000 bond, with her next court appearance scheduled for Feb. 8.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"COLORADO SPRINGS \\u2014 After fifteen years of envisioning an affordable housing development, three nonprofit organizations, alongside community members, have successfully commenced the expansion of Bentley Commons.\\nBringing affordable housing into the southeast side of Colorado Springs could not be done alone. This development came to life thanks to the collaboration between Greccio Housing, Partners in Housing, and the Rocky Mountain Community Land Trust.\\n'GPR Properties, the development entity of this project, consists of Greccio Housing, Partners in Housing, and the Rocky Mountain Community Land Trust,' Executive Director of Greccio Housing, Lee Patke said. 'Together, we provide transitional housing, affordable rentals, and affordable homeownership opportunities.'\\nThe idea originated in 2009 and over 15 years, the three collaborated to obtain and convert this property into affordable housing.\\n'Since that time, we've planned, we've envisioned and we imagined what could be possible here with the three strong local nonprofits,' Patke said. 'Today, we're presenting a groundbreaking to the community that will represent 192 units of new affordable housing.'\\nCurrently, there are two existing buildings on the property, but this expansion will bring six new buildings offering a wide variety of units to meet the needs of the community.\\n'Among the 192 units, got a great mix of one-, two- and three-bedroom units,' Patke said. 'Three-bedrooms are really scarce in our community for rentals and the community has driven hard to try to increase that and we're thrilled to have 27 of those units here on this property.'\\nAs the Pikes Peak Region becomes home to more people, the price tag on complexes can be a shock. The need for budget-friendly housing is top of mind for GPR Properties in bringing both affordable rentals and homeownership opportunities to the city.\\n'Well, the entire community needs affordable housing, and everyone needs an opportunity to live where they work and serve this community,' Patke said. 'Southeast Colorado Springs, especially in the last few years, has been a boom for new industry, new jobs, and fortunately, we've been able to add new housing to that mix as well.'\\nAt the ceremony, there was an outpour of support from the community including Mayor Yemi Mobolade along with district representatives, and members of Harrison School District 2 (HSD2).\\nAmidst the energetic crowd at this groundbreaking event stood Brenda King, who is the newest board member of the Rocky Mountain Community Land Trust. With her own personal journey of finding a permanent and affordable place to call home, her story exemplifies the widespread demand for more accessible housing within the city.\\nI've been there, done that,' King said. 'Luckily, I'm just a lucky person and blessed that Rocky Mountain Community Land Trust helped me buy my first home in September, and so they needed board members and I was like, I can volunteer an hour out of my life once a month to help support and keep up with what's going on in the community housing-wise.'\\nAlthough she has now secured a place to call home, she remains hopeful that others facing similar circumstances will discover the extensive support network available within the city.\\n'The places are out there, they're out there, they will help you go find Greccio Housing, come out to Rocky Mountain Community Land Trust offices, over off of Colorado Boulevard and Partners in Housing,' said King.\\nIn looking out on the development, King said, 'Hopefully others can follow in my footsteps and provide some support to somebody else that needs support.'\\nAlso in attendance was Erika Tunson, the principal at nearby Monterey Elementary School; she emphasized the profound impact this development will have, not only in enhancing students' lives but also in providing housing for teachers.\\n'We serve a school right up the street that has a lot of families that struggle to maintain permanent housing,' Tunson said. 'It's so important in the education of children to have a stable school, a stable home life to be successful. So having this housing here provides that, provides a stable home so that they can go to a school and be in a stable position, stay in school, they're not transferring schools. It's so important to the community, to Colorado Springs, to have a well-educated population.'\\nFor over twenty years, Tunson has worked in the district seeing firsthand the city's expansion and the increasing demand for affordable housing, particularly when recruiting new faculty.\\n'This would be an amazing benefit to teachers,' Tunson said. 'We so often lose or don't get the best and the brightest because they simply can't afford to live here, not because they're not passionate about our students and about this city and this district, but because they themselves cannot live here.'\\nEven though this development is done by GPR Properties, Patke said Greccio Housing will manage the property. As the property is still a year and a half away from completion, there is currently no established waitlist. However, Patke advised visiting their website for information on other options within the community and to stay informed on updates.\\n'Everything looking good so far, everything looks good,' Patke said. 'Palace construction is our GC, they broke ground the second week of January and you already see all the work that's done, we are on track for an early summer opening of 2025.'\\nWhile the ground awaits the construction of these new buildings, an uplifting message is already in the air, signaling that this development is just the first step of many toward a brighter future in the southeast side of Colorado Springs.\\n'This has been so long overdue,' Tunson said. 'It is such a great way to promote the wonderful Southeast. It's just a great community and it's nice to say, \\u2018Hey, look what we have, we have this great place for you to live and work in a great community.''\",\n",
