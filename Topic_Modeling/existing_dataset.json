    "summary": "The Moon is gradually shrinking according to a new study leading to a growing number of landslides that may threaten future astronauts The Earth 's natural satellite has lost as much as 100 m in circumference over the last few hundred million years as its core has cooled This may seem like a gradual process but the shrinkage is causing significant surface warping in parts of the Moon 's south pole including areas proposed for Nasa 's crewed Artemis III landings researchers from the University of Maryland say Since the Moon 's shrinking is accompanied by seismic activity like moonquakes scientists warn that locations near fault zones could pose dangers to future human explorers The global distribution of young thrust faults their potential to be active and the potential to form new thrust faults from ongoing global contraction should be considered when planning the location and stability of permanent outposts on the Moon said study co author Thomas Watters from the National Air and Space Museum In the new study researchers linked faults located in the Moon 's southern polar region to one of the most powerful moonquakes recorded by Apollo seismometers over 50 years ago They found that some areas of the Moon 's south pole were particularly vulnerable to landslides from seismic shaking Similar to earthquakes moonquakes are caused by faults in the Moon 's interior and can be strong enough to damage human made structures and equipment on the lunar surface scientists say But unlike earthquakes which last only a few seconds moonquakes could last for hours and even a whole afternoon meaning these shallow quakes can devastate future human settlements This is because the Moon has loose sediment on its surface formed from billions of years of asteroid and comet collisions You can think of the Moon 's surface as being dry grounded gravel and dust Over billions of years the surface has been hit by asteroids and comets with the resulting angular fragments constantly getting ejected from the impacts Nicholas Schmerr another author of the study said As a result the reworked surface material can be micron sized to boulder sized but all very loosely consolidated Loose sediments make it very possible for shaking and landslides to occur Dr Schmerr explained Nasa hopes to launch its first crewed flight to the moon in more than five decades as part of the Artemis missions in late 2024 With plans evolving to ultimately establish a long term presence on the lunar surface researchers hope to scope out the Moon further to identify more locations that may be dangerous for human exploration This work is helping us prepare for what awaits us on the Moon whether that 's engineering structures that can better withstand lunar seismic activity or protecting people from really dangerous zones Dr Schmerr said",

    "summary": "Feb. 4 Among the honors given out last December by the American Institute of Architects Santa Fe chapter as part of its AIA 2023 Design Awards the one that went to what was essentially the best house was the Commendation Award for the Maul Harnar Residence The architect was Michael Krupnick of Santa Fe 's Krupnick Studio Architecture But as the refreshingly self effacing Krupnick would be the first to point out and did the owner of the house Jeff Maul who also founded and owns Santa Fe Awning came to Krupnick and said I have a dream Can you help me I was like Absolutely recalls Krupnick who 's about to leave for a monthlong recharge in Bali with one of his current clients the sculptor Kevin Box I love creative clients Maul who 's partners with Lori Harnar the widow of the late legendary New Mexico architect Jeff Harnar whose most renowned public buildings would be the Jean Cocteau Cinema and the Santa Fe Children 's Museum wanted an aging in place version of the Jeff Harnar designed house he 'd been in which was at the top of a mountain and had about 350 steps from the driveway to the front door far enough away that it had a tram for transporting beer and furniture I 'm getting old Maul had said I ca n't walk that far every day for the rest of my life I need a grownup version of the house I 've lived in the past 30 years A Harnar house This is that house but the 2.0 version I tap into the energy of my clients and we go back and forth says Krupnick of his process who cut his architectural teeth in Florida and Arizona before setting up his own studio in Santa Fe in 1995 I call myself a co designer Jeff and I co designed his space But it 's always my client 's vision I help them art direct and guide them toward the final product Maul knew what he wanted steel and glass And then more steel and glass Western facing glass With a dining room table that 's suspended from the ceiling by a steel cable so it sways Like a sailboat Like a glass and steel sailboat coming out of the side of the mountain Started a year before the pandemic lockdown and finished in 2023 though Haul will likely be tinkering with it forever when he was ready to move in Maul marveled to Krupnick I ca n't believe I built this thing It 's so beautiful That 's my job is to take his vision and his skill and his talents and make it beautiful and functional says Krupnick Jeff was taking a giant risk We did n't know if it was gon na work We went on the adventure together And it did work Looking very much like a high desert Neutra house Krupnick sees it as integrated very much with the land and nature And reflective of New Mexican culture My favorite art form in New Mexico is the low rider And this is definitely a low rider of the architecture world Krupnick does n't really work for awards or fame In most ways though he embodies what the AIA Santa Fe is all about community and communalism As its executive director Tom Spray said I believe the community would be interested in these awards because architects help to shape our surroundings and as we navigate our daily lives much of what we see is a result of their creativity People naturally want to know what 's happening in their community especially when it comes to seeing the best work in the Santa Fe area that has been recognized by a jury of professionals The judges praised the Maul Harnar house thusly This project stood out from other residential entries It reads as a multigenerational experiment in difficult sites ethereal structures with experiential doors and furniture The jury was intrigued to understand how rather than imposing style or preferences the architect served as a medium for the owners to tell the story and pay homage to Jeff Harnar one of New Mexico 's originals The collaboration of Owner Artist and Architect succeeds in execution of an idea People often ask Krupnick who his favorite architect is and he tells them Miles Davis despite citing a background working under Scottsdale Arizona 's Boulder House architect Charles Johnson\u2014\"I learned how to be kind of fearless and organic by working with him\"\u2014who worked under Richard Neutra who worked under Frank Lloyd Wright I like the jazz approach to architecture says Krupnick who 's not at all ashamed to add he does everything from high rises to chicken coops He loves adobe and mixes it as much as he can with contemporary modernist theory and design Along with what he 'd learned from his wife alongside whom he 's worked half his career I honestly learned how to design with a feminine touch by working with her says Krupnick Her influence came in the form of the lime plaster on the walls that really softened it up And we brought the outside in we put boulders in the living room A very Harnaresque touch Aside from his Bali retreat with Box and the 20 or so other projects he always has going he 's working on a transitional living center in Espa\u00f1ola for drug rehab converting an old motel into an Austin style boutique hotel for people in recovery and a container village food truck complex in Ohkay Owingeh for a Native food truck group Though some saw Maul as difficult Krupnick saw a bit of a soulmate He wakes up every day ready to see what the world has to offer To see all of 2023 's Design winners go to www.aiasantafe.org/2023designawards Saguna Severson graduated with a BA in Architecture from the University of California Berkeley College of Environmental Design After going off to study architecture in Japan she moved to Santa Fe and has never looked back Working first for Santa Fe architects she then went for an MA in Counseling Psychology and is now the Marketing Director at Zachary and Sons Homes at zacharyandsons.com",

    "summary": "Earth 's moon is a constant in the night sky following predictable phases in its orbit However its size likely has been changing over time A study published January 25 in the Planetary Science Journal found that the moon has shrunk more than 150 feet in circumference as its core gradually cooled over the past few hundred million years Related The moon is 40 million years older than we thought according to crystals collected by Apollo astronauts A team of scientists from NASA the Smithsonian Arizona State University and The University of Maryland discovered evidence that the continuing shrinkage led to some surface changes around the Lunar South Pole The terrain has even changed in areas where NASA hopes to land during the crewed Artemis III mission This lunar shrinking process looks similar to how a grape wrinkles when it becomes a raisin The moon also wrinkles and creases as it shrinks down However a grape has a flexible skin while the moon has a brittle surface The brittleness causes faults to form where sections of the crust push up against each other The fault formation caused by this continued shrinking often comes with seismic activity like moonquakes Any locations near these moon fault zones could pose a threat to human exploration there the same way that those living near fault lines on Earth face a greater risk of earthquakes In the new study the team linked a group of faults in the moon 's south polar region to a powerful moonquake recorded by Apollo seismometers over 50 years ago They used computer models to simulate the stability of surface slopes here and found that some areas in particular were vulnerable to lunar landslides from the seismic activity Our modeling suggests that shallow moonquakes capable of producing strong ground shaking in the south polar region are possible from slip events on existing faults or the formation of new thrust faults Thomas R. Watters study co author and senior scientist emeritus in the National Air and Space Museum said in a statement The global distribution of young thrust faults their potential to be active and the potential to form new thrust faults from ongoing global contraction should be considered when planning the location and stability of permanent outposts on the moon Shallow moonquakes occur only about 100 or so miles deep into the moon 's crust They are caused by faults and can be strong enough to damage equipment and human made structures Earthquakes tend to last for only a few seconds or minutes at most Shallow moonquakes can last for hours and even a whole afternoon The team connected the magnitude 5 moonquake recorded by the Apollo Passive Seismic Network in the 1970s to a group of faults detected by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter more recently This means that this seismic activity could devastate any future hypothetical settlements on the moon Related 10 incredible lunar missions that paved the way for Artemis You can think of the moon 's surface as being dry grounded gravel and dust Over billions of years the surface has been hit by asteroids and comets with the resulting angular fragments constantly getting ejected from the impacts study co author and University of Maryland geologist Nicholas Schmerr said in a statement As a result the reworked surface material can be micron sized to boulder sized but all very loosely consolidated Loose sediments make it very possible for shaking and landslides to occur The team will continue to map out this seismic activity on the moon hoping to pinpoint more locations that could be dangerous for human exploration NASA 's Artemis missions are currently scheduled to launch their first crewed flight in September 2025 with a crewed moon landing scheduled for September 2026 One of the ultimate goals of these future missions is a long term human presence on the moon As we get closer to the crewed Artemis mission 's launch date it 's important to keep our astronauts our equipment and infrastructure as safe as possible Schmerr said This work is helping us prepare for what awaits us on the moon whether that 's engineering structures that can better withstand lunar seismic activity or protecting people from really dangerous zones",

    "excerpt": "Industry pros share the places that stole their hearts and launched their careers",
    "summary": "Ask any travel expert why they got into the business and they 'll likely be quick to shout out a specific destination that stole their heart Maybe it was the incredible food the lively arts scene or the picturesque views that won them over and made them think I 'd like to do this for a living While the options are seemingly endless especially for people who do it for a living everyone secretly has that one spot that trumps the rest We asked six travel experts to weigh in on the places that made them fall in love with travel Here 's what they said Sarah Marston Crocker the founder and owner of Pathways Active Travel in Boulder Colorado grew up hiking hut to hut in the Swiss Alps with her family But it was n't until 2016 when she was between jobs that a trip to Northern Italy propelled her into the travel industry The idea for her active travel company was born on a rocky rugged hiking trail the Alta Via 2 in the heart of the Dolomites a mountain range in the northern Italian Alps We had just ascended up to the highest point on the Alta Via 2 and were enjoying a nice gentle traverse while taking in the panorama as we made our way towards Passo Pordoi and closer views of the Marmolada Glacier Crocker told HuffPost Next Crocker visited Madonna di Campiglio a small ski town and was blown away by how beautiful and accessible this area of the Dolomites was The visit solidified her desire to create Pathways and share this type of memorable hiking experience with others I fell in love with this place and these mountains and with the friendly warm people the culture and the incredible food she said Emma Lasiuk visited Costa Rica in her junior year of college to volunteer near Manuel Antonio She fell in love with the country 's lush green fauna deep blue sea and pink and orange sunsets The local people or Ticos as they proudly call themselves won her heart next I had traveled extensively before visiting here but had never felt so warmly welcomed and safe said Lasiuk now a travel consultant with Costa Rican Vacations She embraced the Pura Vida lifestyle filling her days with hikes early morning beach swims and wildlife spotting When it was time to return to the United States she was terrified that Costa Rica would fade to a memory so much so that she instantly booked another trip and eventually moved there full time There is something for everyone in Costa Rica whether it be zip lining above the treetops in La Fortuna swaying on hanging bridges in the dense cloud forest of Monteverde jumping off waterfalls in the deep jungles of Manuel Antonio or diving off the Central Pacific coast at Ca\u00f1o Island she said I can not see myself living anywhere else Madison Ned Butler communications manager with the Rail Passengers Association has seen most of the country through their long distance train travels but one destination in the South stood out Mississippi is beautiful complicated joyous bold and friendly they told HuffPost In 2019 Butler spent a week and a half traversing the Gulf Coast and exploring the Delta in awe of the state 's culture and communities The food music and art scenes are phenomenal right now I 've seen brilliant emerging talent from the state that has already produced many of our most acclaimed artists Butler said Perhaps their favorite part was visiting the various historical sites and museums including the Mississippi Freedom Trail and the Civil Rights Museum in nearby Memphis Tennessee There is a feeling of hopeful change with a recognition of history 's tragedies that I think is very conscious and beautiful Butler said I think everyone that lives in the U.S. should visit these sites and take that history in for themselves In 2006 Stephanie Chastain and her husband were looking for a destination for their honeymoon Chastain had never traveled internationally They chose Ireland because they 'd heard great things about the scenery and history Chastain now the founder of Infinite Ireland Travel Co. told HuffPost she was a goner from the moment she stepped off the plane She was most looking forward to the iconic sites like the Cliffs of Moher and Killarney National Park and while they were spectacular it was the people and the local sites that wound up being the most memorable for her She and her husband spent their days weaving though mom and pop shops visiting old tiny pubs and stumbling on hidden gems that were n't in their guidebooks such as the 300 A.D. stone fort sitting in the middle of a farmer 's field After that trip and a few return visits Chastain decided to help others experience authentic local Ireland People who travel to Ireland often try to zip around to all the iconic sites Chastain encourages people to go at a slower pace so they have time to meet the local people meander through lesser known spots and leave room for adventure Nick Kembel a travel photographer and writer first visited Taiwan because he was curious to learn about a new destination He immediately felt welcomed he said locals help people navigate around and provide tips on cheap eats They 'll insist you try their grandma 's secret soup dumplings or point you toward hidden night market stalls that only locals know about Kembel said What sealed the deal for him though was the nature From the peaceful Sun Moon Lake to the dramatic Taroko Gorge every landscape told stories and hiking was seeing more magic Kembel said Years ago Jim Pattiz a nature filmmaker and co founder of the organization More Than Just Parks took a spur of the moment summer road trip from his home in Atlanta to the Grand Canyon It ended up changing the course of his life Pattiz and his crew borrowed his grandmother 's Prius and drove straight through to New Mexico followed by a visit to Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona Having grown up in Georgia all I knew were woods and streams but here you could see beautiful summer storms rolling in miles and miles off in the distance Pattiz told HuffPost He recalls the blue mesas the striped hills and of course the petrified wood The vastness of it all awakened his senses he says and everything suddenly seemed so exciting and possible That feeling of enchantment and wide open possibilities is one I 've chased ever since in my travels all across America 's public lands he said",

    "excerpt": "Moon based telescopes would allow astronomers to conduct cutting edge science But given how busy the moon is getting will the lunar surface be free enough from interference",
    "summary": "Space scientists are eager to protect the option of doing astronomy from the moon There are plans in the works to place astronomical hardware on the lunar landscape such as super cooled infrared telescopes a swath of gravitational wave detectors large Arecibo like radio telescopes even peek a boo instruments tuned up to seek out evidence for out there aliens Yes the future of lunar astronomy beckons But some scientists say there 's an urgent need to protect any moon based astronomical equipment from interference caused by other planned activities on the moon ensuring they can carry out their mission of probing the surrounding universe To that end efforts are ongoing to scope out and create policy in conjunction with the United Nations in the hope of fostering international support for such protections This action plan is spearheaded by the International Astronomical Union IAU The IAU brings together more than 12000 active professional astronomers from over 100 countries worldwide Richard Green is chair of the IAU group specific to looking at the issues of staging astronomy from the moon He is also an assistant director for government relations at Steward Observatory run by the University of Arizona in Tucson The IAU working group is aiming to collaborate with a number of other non governmental organizations to protect the option of doing astronomy from the moon Green tells Space.com A number of participants in the IAU working group are spectrum managers from radio observatories strongly linked to the International Telecommunication Union ITU and ITU 's World Radiocommunication Conference a treaty level forum to review and revise if necessary radio regulations and global agreements regarding use of the radio frequency spectrum and the geostationary satellite and non geostationary satellite orbits The working group members want to maximize the range of protected frequencies including the very low frequencies needed to study the early universe and auroral emissions from planets Green says The other approach says Green is for protection of sites on the moon that might be suitable for cooled infrared telescopes or gravitational wave detector arrays We have common cause with those who want to protect historical legacy sites and even those who want dedicated sites for extracting water or minerals Green says We imagine that the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is the venue in which some process can be developed to claim a site for protection and to resolve competing claims The IAU Astronomy from the moon working group has space law and policy experts who can provide a strong basis for that approach Green says Of course the main goal is to conduct astronomical observations that can be uniquely done from the moon Green explains The working group is embracing the expertise of principal investigators of lunar missions or concepts for missions Doing so Green says can help engage the astronomical community in prioritizing sites of extreme scientific interest and take in issues of conducting science in an environment for which equitable access is anchored in the spirit of the United Nations 1967 Outer Space Treaty A thumbs up approval of the IAU initiative is Ian Crawford a professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck College London My own view is that a subset of lunar locations for example specific polar craters and key far side locations need to be designated as Sites of Special Scientific Importance and protected as such Crawford told Space.com A possible model Crawford suggests might be the Antarctic Specially Protected Areas ASPAs as defined in Annex V of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty In any case international coordination is clearly required so United Nations involvement appears entirely appropriate Crawford says NASA is working with several U.S. firms to deliver science and technology to the moon 's surface by way of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services CLPS initiative Given the uptick in future CLPS enabled robotic lunar exploration we are about to the see the first NASA funded science payloads landed there in over 51 years since the Apollo 17 human moon landing in December 1972 says Jack Burns professor emeritus in the department of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder One payload for which Burns serves as co investigator is called the Radio Wave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath ROLSES If successful it would be the first radio telescope on the moon and situated at the lunar south pole ROLSES is to be emplaced there in February via the Intuitive Machines Nova C lunar lander 's IM-1 mission under the CLPS partnership This will be followed in two years by the Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment Night or LuSEE Night slated to fly in 2026 aboard the Firefly Aerospace Blue Ghost Mission-2 lander This endeavor is also part of the CLPS undertaking and Burns is a science team member of the LUNAR far side experiment LuSee Night is a radio telescope that will look into the never before seen dark ages of the early universe a time before the birth of the first stars With this potential and promising burgeoning of radio astronomy from the moon Burns says it is essential that we now develop international agreements to protect the far side of the moon for radio astronomy as it is the only truly radio quiet site in the inner solar system Burns emphasizes that radio observations from the moon are no longer science fiction but science fact We are entering a new era of science investigations from our nearest neighbor in space Burns says",

    "excerpt": "For decades 247 Linden St. was home to Joe 's Auto Upholstery After a two year redevelopment project its doors may reopen to the public next month",
    "summary": "The smell of vinyl and the sound of a clacking sewing machine will soon be replaced by the aroma of fresh baked sourdough and the din of diners at 247 Linden St. Bread Fellow a new bakery and cafe in Fort Collins is set to open in the historic 1882 building in late February marking a new life for the longtime former auto upholstery shop The bakery 's opening will also signify the end of eight years of closed doors and a two year redevelopment project that has transformed the space from top to bottom The building is the first project for Snagwood a Boulder based development business focused on restoring historic mixed use buildings in walkable downtown areas across Colorado The company purchased the Tubbs and Cowan block at 247 and 249 Linden St. best known for its decades as Joe 's Auto Upholstery in 2021 according to Snagwood founder and owner Drew Fink I felt like downtown Fort Collins was a uniquely special historic center it 's expansive it 's cohesive it 's been really well preserved Fink told the Coloradoan At the same time you have a lot of creatives and entrepreneurs It felt like a really vibrant place Walking the line between a full table service and fast casual restaurant Bread Fellow is looking to strike a balance with its elevated food and cozy atmosphere according to co owner and founder Jenn Webb The small batch bakery and cafe is the latest project for Jenn and her husband Andrew Webb who opened Bindle Coffee together out of an old mechanic 's garage in the redeveloped Jessup Farm Artisan Village back in 2015 Bread Fellow has been in the works for about two years roughly around the time the Webbs found the Linden Street space and became part of its redevelopment plans The bakery and cafe will focus on sourdough with an emphasis on nourishing foods including soups bread toast and weekend brunch Jenn said It 's an elevated version of what we 're currently doing she added referring to Bindle Coffee We 'll still have a full espresso bar and pastries but with the addition of sourdough bread and breakfasts and lunches Bread Fellow is hoping to softly open in late February Jenn said Its hours will be 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. Monday through Saturday Since purchasing the Tubbs and Cowan block Snagwood has rebuilt the building 's interior which had been gutted prior to its 2021 sale into a mixed use space with Bread Fellow on its ground floor and an apartment on its second floor The apartment will be used as a short term rental according to Fink As part of the apartment 's renovation Fink said Snagwood preserved the building 's original second story window openings and used a historically accurate plaster on its brick walls With the exception of replacing its garage doors windows and trim as well as the repair and repainting of its original brick few changes were made to the exterior of the building Fink added Of the changes made all fit within the Secretary of the Interior 's standards for the treatment of historic properties since Snagwood is seeking state and federal tax credits for the project he said The building has been listed as a contributing structure in Fort Collins locally and nationally designated Old Town Historic District since the late 1970s Almost all the materials salvaged from the building during its interior demolition have also been cleaned and repurposed for use in Bread Fellow from its original 1880s interior wood framing to its floor and roof boards Fink said Meanwhile in a garage on the other side of Jefferson Street another homage to 247 Linden St. is in the works When I walked into Joe 's Auto Upholstery 's Willow Street shop early this week I was greeted by the characteristic quiet of a Monday morning the slight chill of an airy Colorado garage in January and Richard Cienfuegos The 77 year old has spent practically all his life around Joe 's Auto Upholstery the business his father Joe Cienfuegos started after coming home to Fort Collins following his service in World War II After first running his upholstery business out of an auto repair shop at the corner of Jefferson and Linden streets Richard said his parents Joe and Teresa purchased the building at 247 and 249 Linden St. around 1952 It set them back $ 7000 according to Richard That was a lot back then he said The average wage then was only $ 1 an hour for grown men not even that By then the Italianate style building which had spent its early years as a restaurant furniture store and later a feed hay coal and harness shop according to local blog Northern Colorado History had settled into its life as an auto service station The building had been modified with a garage door by at least 1929 per historic building permits and was home to Hawley 's Auto Top Shop when the Cienfuegos family took it over Richard said Want more Fort Collins history Check out The Coloradoan 's binge worthy podpast podcast Richard remembered working alongside his dad and brothers Joe Jr. and George in the Linden Street shop which was often characterized by the smell of vinyl fabric the trill of a sewing machine and the hiss of Joe 's air stapler an amazingly modern gadget back in the 1950s Richard recalled with a laugh It 's a great building My dad always said Linden Street 's the place to make your living Richard recalled noting that the downtown street was once home to multiple grocery stores a furniture store and auto shops like Joe 's Auto Upholstery Joe ran the shop until his retirement around 1985 when Richard took over the business He died in 2011 Richard said Linden Street got increasingly busy over the years with regular 8 to-5 businesses like Joe 's Auto Upholstery giving way to more bars that catered to Colorado State University students In 2015 after more than 60 years in the Cienfuegos family Richard sold the building Roughly five years ago he moved the auto upholstery shop to its current location at 310 Willow St. It was there surrounded by tables of fabric samples and walls lined with antique clocks and telephones that Richard directed me to a table near the center of his shop Monday and gently lifted up a panel of vinyl fabric lined with a quilt like pattern of stitches As part of the redevelopment the Joe 's Auto Upholstery sign that once hung above the business 's door will be showcased in a decorative display case constructed from the building 's original lumber and set against this upholstered piece from Richard Once finished it will be returned backlit and displayed in the only home it knows 247 Linden St. This article originally

're one of the first 100 people to come through here this season You 're flattening the trail making it easier for everyone else Alcott a one time Olympic downhill ninja and now the effervescent co host of the BBC 's Ski Sunday had swung us into the Hidden Valley one of her secret showstoppers in the Tignes area after delivering a warning This is off piste she said suddenly serious So you do this at your own risk As we jittered on to the snaking trail which was about the width of a tea tray we quickly realised this was n't a valley at all more of a tight twisting gorge flanked by sheer sided boulders and dotted with hair raising drops that even Alcott could n't descend without taking off her skis What a mellow morning she said breezily as the sunlight cascaded through the pines all around us That would n't have been my word for it especially when the track veered into a delightful snow dusted forest I caught an edge and ended up cartwheeling down the mountain almost taking out some hikers snowshoeing up through the drifts Those runs we did to get here said Alcott when I finally caught back up they 're lovely and they 're fun but they 're not memorable This is memorable It was a spectacular introduction to the many delights of Tignes and it was just the warm up Ahead lay the Four Corners Challenge an up at dawn skip the long lunch sprint around the extremities of Espace Killy as the linked area of Tignes and Val d'Is\u00e8re is called This odyssey reaches its giddying climax atop the wind blasted Grande Motte glacier some 3456 metres up I was able to enjoy these breathtaking mountains without the gnawing guilt generally associated with reaching them As I lay sweating in the hotel sauna that evening I could feel the impact of the slopes on every bit of my body But nowadays of course you also have to think about your own impact on the slopes Global heating is already having a devastating effect on the Alps with the lack of snowfall leaving resorts especially lower ones struggling to stay open for the whole season One La Sambuy has permanently closed its slopes For once though I was able to enjoy these breathtaking mountains without the gnawing guilt generally associated with reaching them I 'd come by rail departing from London St Pancras at 9 am on a Saturday aboard the inaugural journey of Eurostar 's resurrected Snow Train a service axed in 2020 when Covid struck After one rapid change at Lille where we did n't even have to switch platforms our roomy TGV eased into Bourg St Maurice after nightfall having sped past some ravishing sunsets over gleaming lakes The train certainly seemed popular with Brits our hurtling juggernaut ran out of tea in one hour flat From Bourg in the heart of the French Alps it was just 40 minutes by minibus to Tignes While transport will make up the lion 's share of any snow holiday 's carbon footprint hotels play a part too We stayed at Rosset a chalet style hotel boasting a swish top floor bar with mountain views plush sofas a crackling cheek sizzling log fire and a seemingly endless supply of post piste cake and pre dinner canap\u00e9s and fizz No wonder the apr\u00e8s in Tignes and Val d'Is\u00e8re tends to mean dancing on tables the adrenalin just keeps coming A five minute walk from the Tignes lifts Rosset has implemented waste water and even clingfilm reduction methods along with refillable toiletry dispensers and the requirement that guests pick dinner in advance cutting down on food waste This allowed me to choose from miso aubergine roasted sea bass or steamed mussels while biting into goat 's cheese on sourdough toast at breakfast Water is from the tap bottled can be supplied and the overall ethos is less meat more veg and a push to source locally right down to the artworks on the walls The hefty black and white images depict brooding and often cloud shrouded mountains all supplied by a local photography collective called Art'com and a far cry from the usual bland blue skies over airy peaks The Four Corners required an early morning trip on the Scare Chair the nickname given to the Leissi\u00e8res link to the Pisaillas glacier an oasis of fabulous and generally less busy runs Widely regarded as the world 's most frightening lift the Scare Chair is a stomach churning high speed ride up to a gnarled mountain ridge followed by a lurching plummet down its other side It did n't disappoint providing a glorious gateway to everything that is great about Tignes one of the highest resorts in Europe You can knock about all day on its wide weaving twisting banking bread and butter runs bouncing in and out of powder fields off piste But should you also have a yearning to go high far and fast Tignes takes some beating as we discovered on every thrilling inch of the Four Corners not least that long final dizzying descent from Grande Motte reached by a funicular that shoots up a tunnel like a bullet through the black No wonder the apr\u00e8s in Tignes and Val d'Is\u00e8re tends to mean dancing on tables the adrenalin just keeps coming I was voted the best dancer in Folkestone said the woman sharing a tabletop with me at the Folie Douce or Sheer

napkins tin cans and used teabags which I zipped into my bag as I left my hotel room glancing one last time at the framed message on the table Help us go greener it said so our mountains do n't Trip

    "summary": "Writers draw inspiration from countless sources and experiences For a younger Nilo Cruz a New York Times story about the 1991 arrest and imprisonment of Cuban poet and novelist Mar\u00eda Elena Cruz Varela helped spark his play Two Sisters and a Piano She and her friends wrote a manifesto asking for Cuba to open up the equivalent of perestroika Cruz says in a Zoom interview from his Miami apartment on a rare day off from the production of Two Sisters he 's directing for Miami New Drama Brigadiers dragged her into the street and tried to force her to eat the manifesto She spent two years in prison and another year under house arrest Two Sisters and a Piano which previews at Miami Beach 's Colony Theatre on Thursday Jan. 25 and Friday Jan. 26 then officially opens with an already sold out performance on Saturday Jan. 27 follows last season 's box office and critical success with Miami New Drama 's Cruz directed production of Anna in the Tropics which was seen by 8700 theatergoers according to the Miami based theater company That play was a life changing work of art that made Cruz the first Latino winner of the Pulitzer Prize for drama in 2003 Two Sisters is an earlier play a kind of prelude to Anna in the Tropics in its exploration of the power of literature the escape that words and the imagination can provide the relationship of two disparate sisters It began in the 1990s as a radio play then was expanded for its 1999 world premiere at the Tony Award winning McCarter Theatre Center in Princeton New Jersey where Cruz found ongoing champions for his work in former artistic director playwright Emily Mann and dramaturg Janice Paran Returning to Two Sisters and a Piano in Florida at this moment in time Cruz says seems right particularly since so many school districts here have banned books Cuba is a country we criticize because of dictatorships but here we are in the United States where books are being censored not just because of sexual content but because of historical content as well says the playwright who came to Miami from Cuba on a 1970 Freedom Flight when he was 10 I read books like The Bluest Eye The Diary of Anne Frank To Kill a Mockingbird as a teenager They had an impact on me understanding words as a way to escape oppression Cruz 's two sisters are Maria Celia Thais Menendez a novelist whose husband Antonio has left for Europe where he 's working to get her out of Cuba and the younger Sofia Stephanie Machado a talented pianist and imaginative romantic After two years in prison the women have come back to the Obispo family 's once stately home now stripped of much of its furniture and treasures except for Sofia 's precious piano Two men one a dangerous official with an agenda the other an amusing romantic who loves music as much as Sofia does enter the sisters closed off world Lieutenant Portuondo Maurice Compte has been confiscating Maria Celia 's letters to Antonio and his to her He 's trying to crack the coded communication between the couple while at the same time finding himself increasingly beguiled by the writer and her prose Although the sisters have a permit to have their badly neglected piano tuned they wait then wait some more for someone to arrive Victor Manuel Gabriell Salgado finally does and he proves to be everything that the yearning Sofia could desire Two Sisters and a Piano has had a sporadic presence in South Florida including a 2008 production at the now closed Promethean Theatre in Davie where actors Deborah L. Sherman and Ursula Cataan who originated the roles of sisters Conchita and Marela in New Theatre 's 2002 world premiere of Anna in the Tropics played Maria Celia and Sofia Cruz who writes and publishes his plays in English translated Two Sisters into Spanish in 2019 and staged a production for Miami 's Arca Images at Miami Dade County Auditorium 's On Stage Black Box In June 2023 he directed a production at Two River Theater in Red Bank New Jersey using his original English script ditto at Miami New Drama As he did with Anna in the Tropics at last season Cruz has approached the new Two Sisters and a Piano with deep knowledge gleaned from past productions coupled with a collaborative willingness to take a fresh approach with the actors and designers including Carbonell Award winning set designers Christopher and Justin Swader I wanted to explore the metaphor of suspension When you walk into the production you 'll see the furniture that was taken hanging in midair Later you 'll see a suspended labyrinth of letters from Maria Celia and her husband says Cruz who was inspired by his memory of a long ago exhibition with suspended works of art at the Duomo in Naples Italy The suspension applies to the lives of the women the island itself and the sisters future Cruz has also added something to the script a monologue for Victor Manuel the piano tuner who is deeply drawn to Sofia but afraid of the consequences if he continues to act on his feelings in a world that is so vigilant says the playwright All four cast members grew up in Miami though only Salgado still lives here Cruz has been inspired by them during the give and take of rehearsals and vice versa The marquee name in the cast belongs to Compte whose father Roman fought at the Bay of Pigs and later ran the Mutiny Hotel in Coconut Grove in its flashy heyday a limited series MGM+ crime thriller Hotel Cocaine starring Miami native Danny Pino as Roman Compte should begin airing this summer Of note Hotel Cocaine was created by Chris Brancato the co creator of the Netflix series Narcos which featured Maurice Compte as Horacio Carillo in a dozen episodes The younger Compte has done theater in the past some in his hometown where he went to Miami Senior High but his very long list of credits is largely focused on film and television He said yes to Two Sisters and a Piano he says because of Nilo and Miami New Drama Compte has a vivid memory of going to the Colony Theatre in 1995 to see a production of Romeo and Juliet starring Pino and Blaine Dunham I thought One day I 'll come back and be the lead here in a play says Compte The actor is enthralled with the discoveries that come during the rehearsal process making tiny adjustments solidifying choices He finds Cruz 's unique writing style both descriptive and colorful lying somewhere between reality and a dream world As an actor Cruz says Maurice has a certain mystery ambiguity rawness danger which is like what Marlon Brando had Menendez comes from a Cuban American family Machado from a Brazilian one Both grew up reading or seeing Cruz 's plays and seem a little in awe of working with him Menendez appeared in GableStage 's intense production of Charise Castro Smith 's El hurac\u00e1n The Hurricane last season with Adriana Savan who played Maria Celia in the 2000 Public Theater production of Two Sisters in New York She says of Cruz Just because it 's his play does n't mean he knows everything He knows what works But you get the sense he 's doing it with fresh eyes every time A Boston College graduate who speaks fluent Spanish and French as well as English Menendez has found a key to Cruz 's distinctive style Nilo 's writing is like singing It has melody rhythm and crescendos He writes in English but the sentence structure is the way it is in Spanish Cruz cast Menendez who is younger than some actors who have played Maria Celia because this time he wanted the character to be someone who has n't had enough time in her marriage someone longing for children I wanted her to have physical beauty and a certain elegance holding onto an Old World dignity To play Sofia he chose Machado who has a master 's degree in acting from Yale also because of the way she exudes elegance and more She has so many tools at her disposal she embodies fragility and innocence but she can also be comedic and tragic I told her You 're meant to be in my plays he says Machado who speaks Portuguese as well as English lives in New York where she teaches and acts I vowed I would never wait tables she says laughing When her father comes to Two Sisters and a Piano on opening night it will be the first time he has seen her perform since her days as a high school musical theater major at Miami 's New World School of the Arts Cruz she says is a wonderful writer and director I love heightened text It 's what drew me to Nilo from the get go His language can get so poetic but it 's rooted in truth His characters want big things she observes The way he directs is also poetic He told me that the character I 'm playing is like a pomegranate about to explode He has so much dignity and poise Machado had a pinch me moment in rehearsals when she and Menendez were working on a scene in which the sisters escape by dressing up and dancing together He helped us do the salsa It hit me all at once Here I am dancing with Nilo Cruz looking into his eyes doing this play in Miami she says He 's not pompous at all He just nonchalantly throws wisdom at us Salgado a New World college grad who appeared with Menendez in El hurac\u00e1n has built an eclectic resume appearing at theaters throughout South Florida most recently adding his turn as one very funny cook in Clyde 's for Miami 's Zoetic Stage Last season he played the pivotal role of the dreamy lector in Cruz 's Anna in the Tropics and though Salgado intended to focus on film projects this season Cruz Two Sisters and Miami New Drama drew him back to the stage Nilo wrote this beautiful monologue which I was n't aware of until the first day of rehearsals There is definitely humor in this play I 'm practically doing clown work borderline physical comedy for the scenes in the first act says Salgado He adds I have never felt more in my wheelhouse than I do now Every time Nilo does something it 's like he 's doing it for the first time He puts all the same sand in the sandbox but when he takes it out he builds a new castle What a genuine present vulnerable and gracious director and artist he is Once Two Sisters and a Piano is up and running Cruz will have very little time before going into rehearsals for his next project the world premiere of Sed en la calle del agua Thirst on Water Street for Arca Images The Spanish language production which will have simultaneous English translation will have a brief run at the On Stage Black Box from Thursday March 14 to Sunday March 17 About an artist fighting to regain her sanity after a tragedy it is set in a New York asylum with flashbacks to earlier days in Mexico Cruz is also writing a new play for Miami New Drama creating a historical play for Ford 's Theatre in Washington D.C. working on likely New York productions of Two Sisters and a Piano at Classic Stage Company and Anna in the Tropics by an as yet unannounced major company In 2025 El ultimo sue\u00f1o de Frida y Diego The Last Dream of Frida and Diego with music by Gabriela Lena Frank and a libretto by Cruz will mark the playwright 's Metropolitan Opera debut And he has other projects in the works too The workflow he says with a smile can make him feel like Sisyphus as he does the playwright 's equivalent of rolling a boulder up a hill over and over again But at the same time he 's happy about what 's on the horizon I 'll just be glad to be working in New York again says Cruz who lives in Miami It 's my second home WHAT Two Sisters and a Piano by Nilo Cruz WHERE Miami New Drama production at the Colony Theatre 1040

    "excerpt": "Multiple footprints discovered in Larache Morocco are among the earliest attributed to Homo sapiens worldwide",
    "summary": "Some 90000 years ago a group of humans walked across a sandy beach in the city of Larache on Morocco 's northwest coast Remarkably archaeologists have found a large number of intact footprints from the journey These represent the oldest human prints found in the region and among the earliest attributed to Homo sapiens worldwide Footprints represent moments frozen in time that can reveal fascinating details on everything from stature age and body mass to speed gait and social behavior After studying 85 of the most well preserved fossilized prints found in Larache the international team of researchers concluded they were made by at least five people including children an adolescent and adults They detail their findings in a new study published in the journal Scientific Reports This is an exciting discovery and it adds to other evidence that the Middle Stone Age inhabitants of Morocco were visiting the coast presumably in search of food and other items Louise Humphrey a bioarchaelogist with London 's Natural History Museum who was not involved with the research said over email Scientists stumbled upon the footprints in 2022 While on a field mission studying boulders on a rocky beach they noticed an indentation in the ground and closer inspection revealed more of them In the study they describe how they identified the markings as footprints based on anatomical characteristics reflective of human feet such as a rounded heel a plantar arch and relatively short toes And they detail how they dated the rock containing the footprints using optically stimulated luminescence a cutting edge technique that measures when materials such as grains of sand last absorbed sunlight Morocco is also home to the Jebel Irhoud archaeological site where scientists discovered the earliest known fossilized remains of homo sapiens dating back 300000 years The oldest known homo sapiens footprints found in South Africa date back 153000 years The Larache researchers believe their footprints survived many millenia at least in part because they 're located in a spot where a large boulder partially protects them from wave swells that would erode the site over time The last 90000 years have seen around 78 feet of sediment deposited above the level of the footprints Mouncef Sedrati a life sciences professor at France 's University of South Brittany and a co author of the study said in an interview It is conceivable that in recent years with the frequent occurrence of storms the cliff of which the layer of footprints constitutes the current base started to erode Sedrati said Consequently the rocky platform began to peel away layer by layer until it reached its present level revealing the footprints in the process It 's unknown what exactly the ancient humans were doing on the beach They could have just been passing through along two trails But since our Pleistocene predecessors were hunter gatherers and past studies have shown the importance of coastal regions for their resource gathering they likely were foraging for food The orientation of their footprints perpendicular to the coastline suggests a search for a marine meal The researchers hypothesize that the children present in the group may have aided in that hunt though further studies will be needed to validate this theory What is particularly exciting about this discovery is the entire paleontological and paleoanthropological potential it provides Sedrati said We have only examined the best preserved 85 footprints Dozens more human and potentially animal prints remain to be explored and studied",

    "summary": "InnovationRx is your weekly digest of healthcare news To get it in your inbox subscribe here Venture capital investors are obsessed with software businesses and healthcare is no different The idea being that software equals the biggest opportunities with the highest profit margin and the greatest return on investment compared to more labor intensive services businesses But when Sam Toole and Marisa Bass early stage healthcare investors at Primary recently surveyed the IPOs and M&A exits of digital health unicorns over the past decade the results were surprising We would have thought that the software side would be way more efficient in terms of that enterprise value creation versus services Toole told Forbes But that was n't the case even though healthcare software businesses had wildly outsized valuations over the past few years When looking at total dollars raised divided by valuation on the public or private markets the return for companies providing healthcare services was 4.7x while companies selling software to health insurers and health systems came in at 3.8x according to the Primary analysis There 's one big caveat here the analysis looked at companies started after 2010 which means neither Veeva Systems nor Livongo was part of the analysis As the IPO drought continues and startups have to raise more and more money early stage investors can end up getting shafted if they do n't participate in future fundraises That 's why Toole and Bass are starting to think about non traditional funding structures including tranche investments such as co leading rounds with bigger later stage VCs and giving the startup access to more money over time as it hits certain milestones The question Toole and Bass posed was whether early stage investors should even invest in healthcare companies And they 're not throwing in the towel just yet Toole believes the market is finally at a tipping point more than a decade after the HITECH Act spurred the march towards electronic health records As health systems continue to be squeezed by cost pressures including labor shortages they are going to be looking to technology as a driver of efficiency He believes we 're at a tipping point of combining underlying technology with providers who are finally willing to adopt it But the hardest thing was with venture investing he said is if you 're wrong

    "title": "Groundhog Day movie The Buddhist lifehacker film",
    "excerpt": "Harold Ramis 1993 movie Groundhog Day is so entertaining you 'll want to see it again and again and again Explore meanings and central themes in the movie",
    "summary": "It 's not true that life is one damn thing after another it 's one damn thing over and over Edna St. Vincent Millay I 've seen the 1993 film Groundhog Day again and again and again but only once on the big screen a few years after it was in theaters It was shown in a packed lecture hall inside Baltimore 's Walters Art Museum followed by a lecture from a comparative religion scholar who took us through the spiritual meaning and symbolism cleverly packaged in what on its surface is a rom com with a Twilight Zone premise Even if you have n't seen the film you still know the basic plot because the term Groundhog Day has entered the common vernacular which alone speaks to its resonance beyond the film itself as shorthand for repeating the same experience over and over But it 's worth seeing for the first time or the tenth to witness self centered weatherman Phil Connors a role only Bill Murray could master breaking that cycle through personal redemption It 's a grand metaphor some scholars see as Buddhist Christian or secularly philosophical It 's also directly practically applicable to how you spend your day today and everyday I think the film is best described as Buddish an adjective coined by the film 's director Harold Ramis to sum up his own belief system His mother in law and one of his best friends were devout Zen Buddhists who hooked him onto its precepts Memorable simple did n't require articles of faith but completely humanistic in every way that I valued he said in aninterview for Chicago magazinein 2008 So I proselytize it without practicing it And what an entertaining Buddish proselytization Groundhog Day is Like sushi or a Jamba Juice shake it 's so delicious you barely realize you 're eating raw fish and fruit That 's the reason for this metaphysical movie 's enduring cult status a genuinely hilarious film that glimpses the meaning of life There are many theories about Phil 's temporal loop which by one estimatelasted nearly 34 years and his eventual escape One sees it as ametaphor for psychotherapy repeating the stories of one 's past until you have a breakthrough that allows you to dismantle old patterns Another claims it illustrates aclassic economic paradigm But the most wisdom invoking evidence amounts to religious insight and how to most fruitfully spend our precious hours One of the central tenets of Buddhism is that we must continue to reincarnate until we find enlightenment The concept called samsara keeps us living out many lives through various modes of existence called gati some lowly animals and others god like as determined by your actions karma Once ignorance and ego are destroyed by your actions and awareness you awaken to the true interconnected reality which frees you from the cycle and into heavenly nirvana In the film written by Danny Rubin a Zen Buddhist according to Ramis DVD commentary of the film Phil reincarnates each day but he also transforms his behavior over time He takes self centered advantage of his unique predicament robbing bank trucks stuffing his face with angel food cake tricking a woman into bed but eventually perfects the day with creative self improvement tasks and compassionately helping others Once he becomes the best possible version of Phil Connors he is released from his temporal prison while simultaneously winning the love of his virtuous producer Rita Phil 's plight is not unlike a character from Greek mythology who was doomed to eternally and perpetually push a boulder up a mountain In his essay The Myth of Sisyphus Albert Camus uses the story to illustrate the absurdity of lives that toil away at meaningless jobs But Camus says we must find hope and therefore meaning in such a plight and he imagines Sisyphus understanding and accepting it There 's a similar Buddhist tale of an enlightened monk who climbs a mountain to get a spoonful of snow in order to fill a well at the bottom of the mountain again and again Some lessons take a long and seemingly futile amount of time to learn Buddhist monasticism is itself Groundhog'-like with the same routine clothes and daily rituals for decades of practice Yet every moment is still different Remember what the ancient Greek philosopher Heraclitus said No man ever steps in the same river twice for it 's not the same river and he 's not the same man In that sense Phil does n't repeat the same day over and over because one significant thing is different each Groundhog Day him He is the one thing that is changing What is time anyway Illusory says Buddhist dogma a notion contained in the Zen koan Phil asks as he begins to understand that his own time is not progressing What if there is no tomorrow There was n't one today That 's right woodchuck chuckers there is no past or future There is only now The Catholic concept of purgatory a spiritual realm where souls must linger until they expiate their remaining sins and earn their way into heaven fits the film 's bill as much as the Buddhist concept samsara And many references and motifs that recur in the film support the notion that Groundhog Day is Christian rather than Buddhist These sticky buns are heaven When you stand in the snow you look like an angel Thegroundhog hibernation rebirth after a death of sorts and emerging from the sleepy tomb is reminiscent of Jesus There 's even a delightfully blasphemous scene in which Phil declares that he isagod I 'm nottheGod I do n't think he wonders aloud as he contemplates how close he comes to the Catholic conception of monotheism Maybe he 's not omnipotent He 's just been around so long he knows everything This after he has shouted like an angry deity I make the weather Then there 's the film 's montage with a homeless man whom Phil brushes off early on patting his pants pockets like he does n't have any cash Later Phil tries to help repeatedly only to find the man dies every time It 's the lesson of the Serenity Prayer written by the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr and later co opted by Alcoholics Anonymous God grant me the serenity to accept the things I can not change The courage to change the things I can And the wisdom to know the difference After accepting that he can not save the old man Phil turns an optimistic and meaningful corner in the plot and begins living in service to others catching a falling boy from a tree saving the mayor from choking etc It 's this change of direction that allows him to escape purgatory Whatever spiritual takeaway the film holds for you it 's an undeniable call for hope Phil survives his many attempts at suicide leaping from a church dropping a toaster in the tub driving off a cliff and is reborn a hopeful charitable man Baptized by death and stronger for it on the other side he tells his television audience When Chekhov saw the long winter he saw a winter bleak and dark and bereft of hope Yet we know that winter is just another step in the cycle of life Winter is such a great metaphor for the bleakness that precedes rebirth I 'll give you a winter prediction the weatherman reports in the hopeless second act of the film It 's gon na be cold it 's gon na be gray and it 's gon na last you for the rest of your life But in a more optimistic stage he wakes up one happy morning and surprises a stranger with a hug and a Samuel Coleridge quote Winter slumbering in the open air wears on its smiling face a dream of spring It 's from the sonnet Work Without Hope which contains the famous line bloom for whom ye may which Phil does This is the classic hero 's journey Phil is exiled into an unexpected adventure despairs suffers losses but eventually learns how to overcome his obstacles and hopelessness By the end of the film he has managed to become the town hero for all the mitzvah he crams into a single day You do n't have to subscribe to Buddhism or Christianity or believe in reincarnation or heaven for this story to be directly applicable to your daily life What would you do if you were stuck in one place and every day was exactly the same and nothing that you did mattered Phil asks a townie Ralph in the film That about sums it up for me says Ralph And who does n't relate at one time or another for one day or many years to that sentiment It 's Thoreau 's life of quiet desperation It 's Sisyphus It 's George Baileypre epiphany in It 's a Wonderful Life I think people place too much emphasis on their careers Phil says to Rita I wish we could all live in the mountains at high altitude That 's where I see myself in five years How about you This sentiment echoes an earlier role in Murray 's career as Larry Darrell in the movie based on the novel by W. Somerset Maugham The Razor 's Edge Darrell takes a pilgrimage to find enlightenment with Tibetan monks high in the Himalayas where he observes that It 's easy to be a holy man on top of a mountain The rest of us are down here in the valley where it 's harder Each day is not that different than the last We 're on autopilot sometimes We 're bored We repeat our bad habits We are often self centered and usually under inspired But something does change every day even if it 's imperceptible It 's ourselves And we can choose how this day will unfold and how we will slowly evolve There might even be a Groundhog Day'-inspired resolution memorizing French poetry playing the piano figuring out how to help others more often Like Phil we can utilize creativity and compassion to change aglass is half empty paradigm to half full The pursuit of meaning is itself meaningful And today as well as everyday can be your first day of spring Sign up for CNN 's Stress But Less newsletter Our six part mindfulness guidewill inform and inspire you to reduce stress while learning how to harness it",

Choose your plan ArrowRight Why would I do that says Simon a communications professional in Brooklyn These videos give me anxiety yet they 're kind of soothing It 's like sucking on a canker sore Simon would discuss this topic only if we did n't use his real name because Simon does n't relish the idea of friends and co workers knowing that he watches disaster videos for recreation I do n't know why I 'm drawn to it Simon says It 's really sick But internet algorithms feed him more If they do n't he feeds himself You 're tapping into this pure raw almost primal instinct that you do n't get in your day to day life he says It makes you feel more alive to stare death in the face Advertisement Simon sends me a few of these videos One shows a tiger shark clamp its jaws around a 23 year old Russian tourist Another shows a 747 cargo plane that seems to hang motionless in the air for several seconds then flips over and races to the ground The explosion on impact looks like something out of a Michael Bay movie but it 's real And it haunts Simon But in a pleasing way In terms of plane crashes he says it 's hard to pick a favorite The videos make me never want to fly or swim again

away Or did you watch enraptured and nauseous and imagine what it would feel like to be sucked from your seat and tossed into a 16000 foot free fall On Reddit more than 2.4 million users follow a subreddit titled r sweatypalms a clearinghouse for videos of near death experiences Whatever it is you fear you 're sure to find it here Here 's a cougar stalking a hiker for six minutes Here 's a spelunker pinned in the narrow crevasse of a cave Advertisement The subreddit 's moderators declined to comment because none of us are qualified to be speaking on the human condition Fair One reason people seek these out says Hoffner is to overcome their fears In a safe context you can experience fear and desensitize yourself she says pointing out it 's a common treatment for phobias There are more specific subreddits if you 're addicted to a particular type of fear and perhaps want to conquer it On r acrophobia you can watch people dangling off cliff faces skyscrapers even the Eiffel Tower You 'll surely stumble up on the viral video from a GoPro camera on the head of a gentleman who climbs 2000 feet up a skinny radio tower to change the lightbulb at the top Filmmaker Scott Mann so enticed by the genre made a thriller titled Fall in which two climbers scale a similar tower and get stuck at the top For about 107 minutes they dangle and despair It 's horrifying It reportedly made back 580 percent of its budget at the box office Advertisement All our fears are baked into the question What if this happened to me says Mann The idea of your life hinging on something as minor as a squeaky bolt But it 's still a movie It 's still safe And that Mann suggests is what makes real life videos such as the one of Alaska Airlines so frightening Share this article Share The reason why

    "summary": "MR CAPEHART Good afternoon and welcome to Washington Post Live and another in our series on Race in America co produced with the Capehart podcast I am Jonathan Capehart associate editor at The Washington Post Wp Get the full experience Choose your plan ArrowRight When Ava DuVernay 's movie Origin premiered at the Venice Film Festival last year it received a nine minute standing ovation The movie written and directed by Ava DuVernay is an adaptation of the bestselling book Caste The origins of Our Discontent by Isabel Wilkerson The film 's power is n't just driven by the subject matter It is driven by its lead actress Aunjanue Ellis Taylor and she joins me now Aunjanue thank you so much for being here Welcome to Washington Post Live MS ELLIS TAYLOR Thank you Thank you for having me MR CAPEHART So before we dive into the movie and your performance let 's talk about how your involvement came about In interviews Ava has said that she had been interviewing Isabel Wilkerson for two years to prepare for this film At what point did Ava approach you and what were those initial conversations like Advertisement MS ELLIS TAYLOR Well I kind of approached her actually MR CAPEHART Oh MS ELLIS TAYLOR I knew that I had heard that she was that she had adapted was adapting the book I just thought I knew the book right by reputation I had not read it yet but I just thought it was just this extraordinary thing that this extraordinary woman was going to do And when I heard that she was starting to cast it I said I want to be a part of that conversation And so I my sister and myself made a picture that sort of matched Ms. Wilkerson 's kind of iconic photo that she has of herself and we sent it to the casting director and the casting director sent it to Ms. DuVernay And then we started talking Laughter MR CAPEHART Okay So then you started talking You get the role but-- MS ELLIS TAYLOR I get the role Thank God Advertisement MR CAPEHART But Wilkerson is famously private I mean I 've been trying for three years since I got my MSNBC show to get her to come on my show just to talk about stuff and her books How did you approach playing her What did you do to prepare MS ELLIS TAYLOR Well one of the first conversations that I had with Ava about what she wanted to achieve with the film is that she was interested in dramatizing the interior life of a woman the interior life of a Black woman particularly a Black genius And that is something that you rarely see in American cinema particularly with women in general We do n't see the inner workings of a woman 's mind how she creates how she makes So that was fascinating to me and one of the reasons why I wanted to do it And then having seen Ms. Wilkerson 's interviews when Caste came out in 2020 this woman is a refined person right She is a wordsmith So her words are her currency It 's her strategy It 's how she moves through the world is a power of her words So what I had to do in lieu of meeting her because I did n't get a chance to meet her hopefully I will one day I had to study her I had to study her interviews I had to study her that famous TED Talk she did when Warmth of Other Suns came out I studied that over and over and over again and that was my source material Advertisement And I 'm sure you would attest to as well Jonathan that her writing one of the reasons probably why you want to talk to her is her writing is so brilliant and one of the reasons why her writing is so brilliant is that she 's so transparent in her approach to her subjects In other words she is always present in her writing her personal life Her own experiences are always present It makes her very accessible So I just went to her book and pulled out what I could from that book what I felt was her MR CAPEHART I 'm sorry I am I am speechless because here you play this as you call it Black genius MS ELLIS TAYLOR Yes MR CAPEHART And she 's so notoriously private that you have n't even met her yet MS ELLIS TAYLOR No I have n't I haven't-- MR CAPEHART Have you heard from her since the movie came out Advertisement MS ELLIS TAYLOR I have n't I have n't heard from her MR CAPEHART And so-- MS ELLIS TAYLOR I 'm terrified I 'm terrified I 'm terrified Can I just be honest I 'm terrified MR CAPEHART Wait Why MS ELLIS TAYLOR I 'm terrified because I you know when you I had this conversation a couple of weeks ago and someone was in the process of doing writing a biography I think it was Alexis Pauline Gumbs and she was talking about her biography work And in the process of that conversation I said I 'm a biographer on screen That is a responsibility That is a huge responsibility whether someone is dead or alive but someone who is still in so there's you know if someone is not around anymore not walking around you can really you can really go into the imagination Right MR CAPEHART Mm hmm Advertisement MS ELLIS TAYLOR But at this point this woman is walking around right now She 's present She 's writing She 's a part of our human she 's a part of our American conversation at this moment and the audacity of me-- Laughter MS ELLIS TAYLOR Do you know what I 'm saying MR CAPEHART Right MS ELLIS TAYLOR To attempt to portray this woman this huge force in our culture I 'm terrified I don't I do n't know what she thinks I have to not think about it but yes I 'm terrified MR CAPEHART Well I will say two things about that One she could not help but be proud of the performance you give of her You are the central the central character in this story and I want to get to that in a second But also I will tell you I interviewed the cast and a lot of the producers of the new NatGeo series Genius MLK X. Advertisement MS ELLIS TAYLOR Mm hmm MR CAPEHART And I asked Kelvin Harrison who plays Martin Luther King Jr you know how did it feel to play that role and he said he was terrified-- MS ELLIS TAYLOR Mm hmm MR CAPEHART --terrified to play such an historic figure So I just throw that out to you Dead or alive if you're if the person you 're portraying is a genius or a monumental figure terror comes with the role It comes with the role MS ELLIS TAYLOR Right right Because it just does n't belong to you It does n't just belong to you It belongs to of course them But also it belongs to the people who read her books who are inspired by her and I 'm one of them Yeah MR CAPEHART So let 's talk so let 's talk more about the book I 've read both Warmth of Other Suns and Caste and Warmth of Other Suns I could see immediately how that could be a movie But when it came to Caste it was you know the idea that that would be a movie given the thick subject matter was a little hard for me to wrap my head around until I saw how Ava DuVernay did it And she did it by making Isabel Wilkerson the focal point of this of the story there There is no real antagonist unless you look at Caste and her journey But talk to me about you know what it was like for you to be in a movie that is about a book where in the book the author is not the central character but in the movie the author is the central character And the journey to what became Caste is what the movie is about Advertisement MS ELLIS TAYLOR Well that 's a mark of the visionary work of Ava of Ava DuVernay In her research of with Ms. Wilkerson and talking to her interviewing her which also lasted several years a few years she found out or discovered really that Ms. Wilkerson herself is a compelling character I mean we know that But what she did n't know was what was happening in her personal life leading up to her writing this book and what was happening or what had happened was that she was experiencing she was experiencing incredible loss unbelievable loss losing three people in a very three of the most important people in her life in a very short amount of time And then she writes this book Right That changed that shifted how we think about race in this country how we think about social divisions in this country She went through that and then wrote this book Most of us would just be felled by that and we would n't get up ever again you know MR CAPEHART Right Advertisement MS ELLIS TAYLOR I know when I lost the love of my life I was silly for years and I 'm still going through it Anyway so Ava found our hero in Ms. Wilkerson and I had to embrace that idea And I just think of her as an Indiana Jones you know going around the world on this intellectual and journalistic quest and the boulder that 's behind her is this you know mammoth grief that is that she 's suffering from And yet she keeps going because her quest is nothing short of saving us saving humanity MR CAPEHART That is an incredible yes she is like that is a great analogy She is like Indiana Jones She is let 's talk about the first spark that drives this film and that is the killing of Trayvon Martin And in this scene that we 're about to show your character gets into gets into it with a persistent editor over the meaning of racism Watch Video plays MR CAPEHART All right So that conversation sparks a journey for Wilkerson and the movie which is as much about Wilkerson 's pursuit of an idea as it is about the idea itself Her theory is complex She writes and I quote Race in the United States is the visible agent of the unseen force of caste Caste is the bones race the skin Aunjanue how has this experience working on this film changed the way you view some of these issues of race justice and oppression MS ELLIS TAYLOR It 's changed it dramatically Dramatically I would say I would say in three ways Share this article Share First of all she 's given me language for something that I thought but did not have the language for if that makes sense MR CAPEHART Mm hmm MS ELLIS TAYLOR For example she builds her argument with these eight pillars of caste showing how her argument for caste with these sort of eight ideas and one of those ideas is how terrorism is used as a means of control I am from the rural South I am from Southwest Mississippi and I live that I live that It is a part of my life These statues these flags that are everywhere even now where I live and knowing knowing the origin of that gives me language that I did not have before knowing that these flags and these statues were not erected out of a geography we 're honoring our fallen heroes but in fact that they were they were erected to intimidate to remind newly emancipated slaves where they came from and where they could easily go back to And then also I would say it 's given me a broader understanding of how we are connected with people around the world I mean the fact that Nazis the Nazis studied Jim Crow in America to figure out the blueprint for how they would go about Nazism in Germany that blew my mind Did that not blow your mind MR CAPEHART Yeah yeah MS ELLIS TAYLOR It blew my mind And then also you know now in this present moment that we are in in this election and having a clear understanding that the way folks in the dominant caste the way that they vote their choice of who they vote for is so determined not by what they feel would be better for the country but by their insistence on maintaining the caste system in America MR CAPEHART Mm hmm So you know this is a great segue to another clip that I wanted to show In this scene Wilkerson gets some pushback on her historical theory as she has it up to that point Let 's play this We 'll talk about it on the other side Video plays MR CAPEHART There is no number And I wanted to show that because if memory serves it is after that conversation that she 's having with those friends in Germany that she then goes down the road of investigating and this is when she discovers that Nazis came to the United States to learn about the Jim Crow system and took it back there And that 's where the through line of caste from African Americans experience with slavery and further experience in the United States the Holocaust in Germany and then the caste system in India that that is where from that quote I read earlier Caste is the bones MS ELLIS TAYLOR Mm hmm Yes yes Exactly And you know one of the some of the hardest work I mean you know I have to say that when I watched that scene I get a I have n't seen the entire movie So I 've only seen clips and I see these see clips in this in situations like this where I want you know in front of other people And when I have seen it I personally I have a personal reaction to that and I watch her Isabelle 's reaction And that would not have been my reaction at all MR CAPEHART Mm hmm mm hmm MS ELLIS TAYLOR I get angry I get angry watching that And I guess that 's my character work that I had to do is because I had to respond in the way that Ms. Wilkerson would have responded not in the way that I Aunjanue Ellis responded And I have to say this That was not Isabel that was not Ms. Wilkerson 's words That was Ava DuVernay 's words And I think it 's important I think it 's important to say that because what Ava was inserting in that moment is this is this you know numberless ness Right That we can't this number that we will never know and one of the reasons why we will never know it is because the numbers keep going up They keep going up Police brutality in this country and Black people being murdered by the state that number keeps going up Sitting in that library in Germany where that those conversations actually happened and the Germans in fact the Nazis felt that they some of the things that were we were making not we but the Jim Crow South particularly were making happen institutionalizing they thought it was absurd for example intermarriage and endogamy They said There 's no way in the world we can make this happen This is ridiculous Even they even they said the links that the Jim Crow South particularly went to they said We ca n't do that That 's not possible to make happen here It 's stunning and what 's even more stunning is that we are not aware We do n't know this We do n't know this about ourselves MR CAPEHART Right You know how is it please explain to me as an actress how you have not seen the movie in full Is that something you do with all of your films or was making Origin so emotionally taxing and draining that you do n't feel ready to see it in its entirety Because I have to say from the opening scene through the end I am holding onto the what do you call it?--the armrests in the theater because it is that powerful from beginning to end Is that the reason MS ELLIS TAYLOR Well I think for me personally as an actor whatever I am you know it 's hard for me to have an experience with something and then see it translated in another form because it 's something that I went through It was something that I personally experienced And then when it's then when it 's become when it becomes something else for someone else to hold it 's not mine anymore And then it becomes it becomes vulnerable to opinion and I'm I do n't want to hear any of that My own included My own opinion you know Laughter MS ELLIS TAYLOR And Origin particularly was so personal for me I went all over the world I had experiences that changed me and I do n't want to bring my own judgment to that I want that experience to be alive in me and cherished by me and I want it to be unsullied So yeah that 's why MR CAPEHART Wow I can't we've got to talk about how this movie got made because Ava DuVernay did n't go through the Hollywood system Maybe the closest she came was going to Netflix who said Hey we want to do the film just not in 2024 So what did she do She went the philanthropic route went to our buddy Darren Walker who 's the president of the Ford Foundation and got the Ford Foundation to help finance it and individuals What do you think what kind of impact do you think that had on the film Do you think not in addition to allowing the film to be made did it give Ava and you and the other folks in the cast the freedom to make the movie that needed to be made MS ELLIS TAYLOR I love when I do interviews with Ava and she says We greenlit ourselves MR CAPEHART Laughs MS ELLIS TAYLOR I love it when she says that you know MR CAPEHART Mm hmm MS ELLIS TAYLOR That is how powerful how powerful that is She did this film outside of the studio system She made it herself She took a production all around the world She did she broke protocols She often did not have permission and I think that 's a very meta thing that she created this film without the permission of the Hollywood system without their money without any of it And she created something I think hopefully for the ages having done so And the other part of it is she would not have been able to make the choices that she made I likely would not have been in the film if it were a studio production and the other folks that I worked with maybe they would n't have been in the film as well She was able to use her own be her own boss in every way She did n't have to answer to anyone but herself Yeah I just I'm so excited by that It 's a paradigm that she 's breaking and I hope that she continues that and I hope others other filmmakers will follow in line with that MR CAPEHART Well I got a couple of questions on that One I find it surprising that you think if she 'd gone through the Hollywood system you would n't have been cast I mean you 're an Oscar nominated actress You were nominated for the Oscar for your role as Serena and Venus 's mother Williams in King Richard So that you know to my layperson 's eye once you get an Academy Award nomination you 're put in this little bucket over here of people who you know go and get the phone calls I can see the look on your face You 're like Child you do n't have any idea what you 're talking about Laughter MR CAPEHART But here 's the key thing I 'm trying to get to Do you think the fact that you guys did greenlight yourself that Ava did go outside the system that she bucked the system that that is one of the one of the reasons why Origin got nary an Oscar nomination not one MS ELLIS TAYLOR Yeah I mean you know it 's over now so we can talk about it Not only did it not get any Oscar nominations outside of the Gotham Awards it was not acknowledged or rewarded or awarded for any award I do n't know how else to say that That was that whose organization or governing body or voting body was predominantly White Not one It 's over now so I can say that you know MR CAPEHART Uh huh MS ELLIS TAYLOR Thank God that we have been honored by the Image Awards and the African American Critics Association They saw They saw us you know to continue the continue that the title the sentiment behind the title of when they see us Ava 's extraordinary work that was on about the Exonerated Five Shout out to Yusef Salaam who 's a New York City councilman right now MR CAPEHART Mm hmm MS ELLIS TAYLOR Yeah they saw us But somehow you know that community did n't MR CAPEHART And you were in you were in that show During the protests over the murder of George Floyd we saw lots of gestures made lots of things said lots of black squares on Instagram lots of people doing putting money behind a lot of things And it seems like a lot of those a lot of those things that happened have fallen by the wayside have faded away have been reversed Do you think that even what Hollywood did during that time were those just gestures or have we seen even the tiniest bit of change in Hollywood Or has it reverted back to type MS ELLIS TAYLOR Well you know a couple things First I want to say I honor and acknowledge my colleagues and my coworkers who have been nominated who were singled out and rightfully awarded for their tremendous work So I want I think both things can coexist So I want to be clear about that You know my response to that is I ca n't care I ca n't care You know I can not care I mean that 's what Toni Morrison said Right And I live by this or try to on my best days anyway is that you know that 's what this stuff does It 's merely a distraction It distracts you from your work It makes you feel that what you have to do is defend your existence defend your art And while you 're defending your existence defending your art guess what you 're not doing Is living and making your art So I ca n't care because that I ca n't care because it keeps me from doing the work that I need to do I mean thank God Ava did n't care you know and as a result of her not caring- or I 'll put it like this She did n't see that as a hurdle for her accomplishing what she achieved in Origin She did it anyway I mean that 's a very that 's a very Black church thing to say doing it anyhow Right MR CAPEHART Uh huh Laughs MS ELLIS TAYLOR That is what she did We have to do it anyhow Even when they do n't care when they do n't see us we do it anyhow Yeah MR CAPEHART Where can where can we see you next MS ELLIS TAYLOR Where can you see me next Well I 'm going to say this You know I 'm still--\"Origin might be in the theaters maybe another couple weeks and my goal with this film is to make strides in penetrating the conservative community And one of those places particularly is organizations like Moms for Liberty Organizations like Mom for Liberty were instrumental in banning the book Caste in places like libraries like Texas in Texas And I feel that Origin being in the world yes it 's great I mean the great thing about Origin is that we are having these discussions now about the caste system in this country But the other part of that is what is standing in the way of our knowing that of our awareness and part of that is book banning So I 'm going to be doing work in that area to bring Origin and the book Caste again it 's already that work is already done with the book but bringing back that back to the forefront MR CAPEHART Whoo Oscar nominated actress Aunjanue Ellis Taylor star of the movie Origin This has been so much fun You know we 've gotten three minutes overtime I want to thank you-- Laughter MR CAPEHART Yes we have I want to thank you so much MS ELLIS TAYLOR Can I fan out two seconds Can I fan out two seconds MR CAPEHART Oh who am I to say no Laughter MS ELLIS TAYLOR You 're not You are not I saw you years ago at the what 's the New York Public Library the award MR CAPEHART The LION Award MS ELLIS TAYLOR Yes yes yes I think Colson Whitehead might have been might have been honored that night Yeah And you were at the you were at the end of the table and I was sitting right down And I was like oh my God there 's Jonathan Capehart So I did n't know until last night that you were going to interview me today and I 'm so excited I 'm so excited

Denver edition we independently scoped out more than 90 venues and distilled the list down to the very best of the best Every recommendation below has earned our most discerning stamp of approval Ever since its establishment as a gold rush town in the 1850s Denver has been a city of transplants Never has that been more evident than in recent years with legions of work from anywhere types heeding its mile high Rocky Mountain backed call of the wild These transplants mostly millennials have become the proxy architects of the city 's fast evolving neighborhoods Retail businesses and restaurants almost always in prefabricated low rise glass buildings seem designed for social media with a cheery photo friendly patina many are popular concepts brought in from their original hometowns such as Brooklyn New York pizza icon Roberta 's and Austin sushi stronghold Uchi But if Denver feels at times like a generic catchall of Pan American culture rather than its own distinct place that 's in the process of changing The city 's economy is roaring as one of the fastest growing in the nation led by software development financial services and aerospace technology Denver International Airport already one of the largest and busiest in the US is forecasting passenger arrivals to climb from 69 million in 2019 to 100 million in the next decade That will happen just as it completes a $ 1.3 billion expansion in 2028 We 've always thought Denver was worth visiting just so we could leave typically to explore the natural wonders of the American West But it 's no longer a base camp it 's a destination in its own right Top Rooms in Town The Ramble Hotel At the Ramble rooms are decidedly Coloradan in theme with a mod cowboy aesthetic framed wildlife diagrams plaid carpeting in the hallways and plenty of leather accents But the vibe is most defined by the proudly flaunted Denver satellite of famed New York bar Death Co which takes over the parquet and concrete lobby 's velvet sofas every evening If you 're hoping for a solid night 's sleep opt for a third story room to put some distance between you and the late night shenanigans on the ground level Rates from $ 235 Source The Ramble Hotel Four Seasons Denver The predictability of Four Seasons solid hospitality feels like a life preserver in a city where the hotel scene is too often characterized by slapdash hotel themes Art Baseball surprise resort fees and $ 9 lobby cappuccinos The d\u00e9cor is textbook international luxury circa 2010 think cherrywood and black lacquer accents but the oversize rooms are immaculate turndown service is seamless and the on site pool and spa are the perfect way to rescue tired limbs from a long day of hiking in the nearby mountains Rates from $ 500 Source Four Seasons Denver Book It on Points Hotel Clio A part of Marriott 's Luxury Collection Hotel Clio feels significantly more upscale than the other similarly priced hotels in Cherry Creek Denver 's bougie borough Guarantee unobstructed views of the city and mountains by requesting a room on the seventh floor or higher Rates from $ 270 Source Hotel Clio a Luxury Collection Hotel Denver Cherry Creek All Day Dining Our favorite restaurants for every meal Denver is dominated by mountains and microbrews Locals start their free days with an eye toward the former either skiing or hiking and accordingly pack breakfasts to go Brunch is big Restaurants fill up first with people pouring in after exercise classes then with mountaineers returning for a patio side refuel Late afternoon beers are common antecedents to early suppers\u20146:30 is prime time As for post dinner drinks They only make sense when adventuring is n't on tomorrow 's agenda \u25cf Noisette Married chefs Lillian and Tim Lu spent years working in the finest French kitchens in New York including Daniel before opening Noisette their bakery and bistro in the LoHi Lower Highland neighborhood Floor to ceiling windows pour ample sunlight across the dining room 's Napoleonic banquettes where you can have flaky pain au chocolates in the morning and savory lobster vol au vent at night both impressive feats considering the recipe rejiggering needed for oven work at altitude \u25cf Temaki Den Reunion Bread Sushi in the landlocked Rockies seemed like an unappealing prospect until we had lunch at Temaki Den a newer venture by esteemed chef Toshi Kizaki who 's been flying in his fish from Japan 's Kyushu island daily for 40 years Go for the three roll temaki set little nori cigars filled with tuna and blue crab Then tack on a couple of orders of seared salmon oshizushi like nigiri but more tightly pressed into a brick shape Bonus Temaki Den practically shares a space with Reunion Bread they 're in the same corner of a vaulted shopping arcade where you can order a spectacular pastel de nata for dessert \u25cf Cart Driver It feels blasphemous to say that some of the best pizza in America is in a city more famous for an omelet and even more outrageous to lavish praise on an oyster served more than a thousand miles from the ocean But Cart Driver pulls off the impossible serving the perfect high low meal of Neapolitan style pies and a dozen Wellfleets with zingy mignonette There are two branches the one in RiNo River North Art District is more casual with picnic tables in a stack of converted shipping containers whereas the LoHi locale does full table service \u25cf No Frills Dining on East Colfax Colfax Avenue a seedy artery that tears across central Denver with its pawn shops gas stations and pay by the hour motels doubles as the surprising home to some of the city 's best unfussy eating Start a food crawl at Bastien 's Restaurant a family run institution where marbled steaks get seared with a proprietary sugar rub and slung to cowboy hatted OGs Then stop for Ukrainian bar bites including varenyky dumplings and piroshki meat pies at Molotov Kitschen + Cocktails do n't judge it by the name before hopping a 10 minute Uber ride down the street to Mango House a small food court of impressive international eats in an otherwise shuttered mall Prioritize the fried samosas and tea leaf salad at Urban Burma \u25cf Point Easy When one of the chef owners of Point Easy died less than a month after this Whittier neighborhood spot opened in 2022 it could 've been curtains for the New American brasserie But its knowledgeable and affable staff have stayed the course turning it into what may be Denver 's best restaurant Although the menu rotates seasonally our favorites dishes were rich marsala style mushroom toast turnips lavished in vadouvan butter and a surprisingly light three meat Bolognese topped with Parmesan confetti \u25cf Yacht Club Crank up the Fiona Apple and dim the fairy lights at this irreverent self proclaimed dive bar which feels like your older brother 's dorm room The cocktails are why you 're here mind expanding mixed drinks with bold untraditional flavors such as curry leaf and Old Bay But everything 's impeccably balanced and there 's canned Miller High Life and franks if you 're not feeling spendy On the Town Activities to squeeze into any schedule \u25cf Get Red on the Rocks When it is n't teeming with concertgoers Red Rocks Park Amphitheatre moonlights sunlights as a do it yourself outdoor exercising arena Head there first thing in the morning for solo stair climbs or group yoga classes the latter are organized by beloved local studios River Yoga and Buffalo Sparrow Come fall the colosseum shaped venue plays host to Fitness in the City 's

of the aptly named Lookout Mountain \u25cf Drink Like a Local Trickling down from Colorado 's iconic mountains is fresh alpine water perfect for brewing beer It 's one reason patios and pale ales make up the backbone of Denver 's apr\u00e8s anything culture Try Cerebral Brewing near City Park for citrusy IPAs and laid back vibes or RiNo 's supersocial Our Mutual Friend where the small batch selection runs from sours to stouts Beyond hops there 's the unexpected Colorado Sake Co. also in RiNo which serves its own Japanese rice wine with tuna rolls and pork buns The Family Jones in LoHi sells batched cocktails made with its own distilled whiskeys and ryes you can take them home or enjoy them on site in a midcentury modern cocktail lounge set inside a large glass encased cube \u25cf Art in the West Hidden in an unassuming downtown office building just off Broadway the American Museum of Western Art is a formerly private collection of paintings that 's now open to the public on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays Its galleries showcase the diverse cultures and perspectives of the US frontier from the expeditionary artists of the late 18th century to modern abstract expressionism For a CliffsNotes tour eye the ethnographic portraiture in Bay 3 then jump to the third floor for some of the finest works of the Taos School which mainly produced landscapes and American Indian portraits keep an eye out for Ernest L. Blumenschein 's dreamlike depictions of New Mexico 's desert mountains and its Indigenous inhabitants For a present day take on art in the American West visit the temporary exhibition spaces at MCA Denver Past shows have repositioned the idea of the cowboy in popular culture and explored Georgia O'Keeffe 's influence on contemporary American painting \u25cf An Interplanetary Adventure A massive mashup of sci fi and sculpture tucked between the concrete ribbons of a downtown highway interchange Meow Wolf Denver Conversion Station may be the city 's best import The interactive museum is an arcane spinoff of the original in Santa Fe New Mexico At this location memories are recorded and traded as currency in a mazelike realm where four faraway planets have suddenly collided Do n't worry if you 're confused we did n't quite understand it either but who cares The Dr. Seuss meets Grateful Dead aesthetic filled with buttons and levers that boop and boinkmakes it the perfect place to drop your kids For adults there 's a futuristic bar meant to look like an airport lounge pulled from the year 3066 Neighborhoods to Know Half day guides to two areas you should hit One central and one

    "excerpt": "Ketamine is emerging as an alternative mental health treatment but with little regulation and varying treatment protocols it 's a medical wild west practitioners say",
    "summary": "This is a KFF Health News story In late 2022 Sarah Gutilla 's treatment resistant depression had grown so severe she was actively contemplating suicide Raised in foster care the 34 year old 's childhood was marked by physical violence sexual abuse and drug use leaving her with life threatening mental scars Out of desperation her husband scraped together $ 600 for the first of six rounds of intravenous ketamine therapy at Ketamine Clinics Los Angeles which administers the generic anesthetic for off label uses such as treating depression When Gutilla got into an Uber for the 75 mile drive to Los Angeles it was the first time she had left her home in Llano California in two years The results she said were instant The amount of relief I felt after the first treatment was what I think normal is supposed to feel like she said I 've never felt so OK and so at peace For profit ketamine clinics have proliferated over the past few years offering infusions for a wide array of mental health issues including obsessive compulsive disorder depression and anxiety Although the off label use of ketamine hydrochloride a Schedule III drug approved by the FDA as an anesthetic in 1970 was considered radical just a decade ago now between 500 and 750 ketamine clinics have cropped up across the nation Market researcher Grand View Research pegged industry revenues at $ 3.1 billion in 2022 and projects them to more than double to $ 6.9 billion by 2030 Most insurance does n't cover ketamine for mental health so patients must pay out of pocket While it 's legal for doctors to prescribe ketamine the FDA has n't approved it for mental health treatment which means that individual practitioners must develop their own treatment protocols The result is wide variability among providers with some favoring gradual low dosage treatments while others advocate larger amounts that can induce hallucinations as the drug is psychedelic at the right doses A vial of Ketamine Nov. 14 2022 in Boulder Colo. Medianews Group The Denver Post via Getty Images Ketamine is the wild West said Dustin Robinson the managing principal of Iter Investments a venture capital firm specializing in hallucinogenic drug treatments Ketamine practitioners stress that the drug 's emergence as a mental health treatment is driven by a desperate need Depression is the leading cause of disability in the United States for individuals ages 15 44 according to the National Institute of Mental Health and around 25 of adults experience a diagnosable mental disorder in any given year Meanwhile many insurance plans cover mental health services at lower rates than physical health care despite laws requiring parity Thus many patients with disorders receive little or no care early on and are desperate by the time they visit a ketamine clinic said Steven Siegel chair of psychiatry and the behavioral sciences at the University of Southern California 's Keck School of Medicine But the revelation that Friends star Matthew Perry died in part from a large dose of ketamine along with billionaire Elon Musk 's open use of the drug has piqued fresh scrutiny of ketamine and its regulatory environment or lack thereof Commercial ketamine clinics often offer same day appointments in which patients can pay out of pocket for a drug that renders immediate results The ketamine is administered intravenously and patients are often given blankets headphones and an eye mask to heighten the dissociative feeling of not being in one 's body A typical dose of ketamine to treat depression which is 10 times lower than the dosage used in anesthesia costs clinics about $ 1 but clinics charge $ 600-$1000 per treatment Ketamine is still shadowed by its reputation as the party drug known as Special K Siegel 's first grant from the National Institutes of Health was to study ketamine as a drug of abuse It has the potential to send users down a K hole otherwise known as a bad trip and can induce psychosis Research in animals and recreational users has shown chronic use of the drug impairs both short- and long term cognition Perry 's death in October raised alarms when the initial toxicology screening attributed his death to the acute effects of ketamine A December report revealed Perry received infusion therapy a week before his death but that the fatal blow was a high dose of the substance taken with an opioid and a sedative on the day of his death indicating that medical ketamine was not to blame A variety of protocols Sam Mandel co founded Ketamine Clinics Los Angeles in 2014 with his father Steven Mandel an anesthesiologist with a background in clinical psychology and Sam said the clinic has established its own protocol That includes monitoring a patient 's vital signs during treatment and keeping psychiatrists and other mental health practitioners on standby to ensure safety Initial treatment starts with a low dose and increases as needed While many clinics follow the Mandels graduated approach the dosing protocol at MY Self Wellness a ketamine clinic in Bonita Springs Florida is geared toward triggering a psychedelic episode Christina Thomas president of MY Self Wellness said she developed her clinic 's procedures against a list of what not to do based on the bad experiences people have reported at other clinics The field is n't entirely unregulated State medical and nursing boards oversee physicians and nurses while the FDA and Drug Enforcement Administration regulate ketamine But most anesthesiologists do n't have a background in mental health while psychiatrists do n't know much about anesthesia Sam Mandel noted He said a collaborative multidisciplinary approach is needed to develop standards across the field particularly because ketamine can affect vital signs such as blood pressure and respiration The protocols governing Spravato an FDA approved medication based on a close chemical cousin of ketamine called esketamine are illustrative Because it has the potential for serious side effects it falls under the FDA 's Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategies program which puts extra requirements in place said Robinson Spravato 's REMS requires two hours of monitoring after each dose and prohibits patients from driving on treatment days Generic ketamine by contrast has no REMS requirements And because it is generic and cheap drugmakers have little financial incentive to undertake the costly clinical trials that would be required for FDA approval That leaves it to the patient to assess ketamine providers Clinics dedicated to intravenous infusions rather than offering the treatment as an add on may be more familiar with the nuances of administering the drug Ideally practitioners should have mental health and anesthesia expertise or have multiple specialties under one roof and clinics should be equipped with hospital grade monitoring equipment Mandel said Siegel who has researched ketamine since 2003 said the drug is especially useful as an emergency intervention abating suicidal thoughts for long enough to give traditional treatments like talk therapy and SSRI antidepressants time to take effect The solutions that we have and have had up until now have failed us Mandel said The drug is now popular enough as a mental health treatment that the name of Mandel 's clinic is a daily sight for thousands of Angelenos as it appears on 26 Adopt A Highway signs along the 405 and 10 freeways And the psychedelic renaissance in mental health is accelerating A drug containing MDMA known as ecstasy or molly is expected to receive FDA approval in 2024 A drug with psilocybin the active ingredient in magic mushrooms could launch as early as 2027 the same year a stroke medicine with the active ingredient of DMT a hallucinogen is expected to debut Robinson said many ketamine clinics have opened in anticipation of the expanded psychedelic market Since these new drugs will likely be covered by insurance Robinson advises clinics to offer FDA approved treatments such as Spravato so they 'll have the proper insurance infrastructure and staff in place For now Sarah Gutilla will pay out of pocket for ketamine treatments One year after her first round of infusions she and her husband are saving for her second In the meantime she spends her days on her ranch in Llano where she rescues dogs and horses and relies on telehealth therapy and psychiatric medications While the infusions are n't a magic fix they are a tool to help her move in the right direction There used to be no light at the end of the tunnel she said Ketamine literally saved my life",

Rachel Woolf for NPR He argues that processed food is already subsidized so it 's not a fair fight Jim Krieger executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America says Guttridge is right There 's lots of subsidies for soy and corn they 're key ingredients for ultra processed foods which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables Krieger says Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they 're forced to use them in the local food system but Boulder county is n't taking that approach Instead of sticks they 're using carrots trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown in competition A force for good Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont Colo. Boulder County Farmer 's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery Mackenzie Sehlke the organization 's executive director pulls open the door of a walk in refrigerator A lot of storage crops in here right now she says MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer 's Markets Rachel Woolf for NPR Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community We have a large Nepalese community here she says So we 're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow she says I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here she says Yes she acknowledges there are plenty of big structural problems with America 's food system but she 's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool she says And I 've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently Policy can be a force for good she says to forge connections between farmer market and hungry resident so it 's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food Photography by Rachel Woolf Katie Hayes Luke edited visuals for this story Diane Webber edited the radio and digital versions of the story",

She had the audacity to believe that her students could have more that they should n't be judged by their zip code so she invited the queen of England to come to her school and the queen came twice so that 's my Barbara Howard spirit Ralph said in front of a New York City audience The person that is so committed to her job to her students that she will not give up just because others might have because of where they live and where they come from so thank you Ralph continued While the actress stays busy booking roles in Hollywood she stays bonded to her family The actress and activist who is married to Pennsylvania state legislator Vincent Hughes is a mom of two adult children Her son Etienne Maurice is a filmmaker actor and activist while her daughter Ivy serves as Ralph 's personal stylist The full conversation between Ralph and Winfrey airs Wednesday on Oprah Daily This article originally appeared on USA TODAY Oprah Sheryl Lee Ralph talk Robert De Niro advice Abbott Elementary",

    "summary": "Essential benchmarks and trends for consumer subscription businesses for faster profitable growth SAN FRANCISCO Jan. 23 2024 /PRNewswire/ Recurly a leading subscription management and billing platform today announced the release of its highly anticipated 2024 State of Subscriptions report Drawing on data across millions of subscribers and billions of transactions this report

industry understand and optimize their business while they continue to develop the long term subscriber relationships that define success in our industry Recurly 's 2024 State of Subscriptions report highlights benchmarks and trends for consumer subscription businesses Post this Noteworthy Trends Subscriber fatigue is overestimated growth continues to be strong Data shows that while acquisition rates and free trial conversions went down correlated to a market wide reduction of acquisition spend and growth at all costs mentality overall subscriber retention improved While subscriber preferences are ever evolving subscriptions themselves remain firmly planted within daily routines The median trial to paid conversion rate was 50 measuring the proportion of trial users who transition into paying subscribers confirming consumers still favor trials The median signup success rate stood at 89 which measures the percentage of initial subscription transactions that were approved This metric is significant as it reflects the effectiveness of the checkout process and backend payment processing Over the past year Recurly saw a 16 increase in active subscribers and when comparing this to 2020 growth surges to 105 2 Brands build relationships attention moves to the most profitable subscribers Recovery events defined as instances where technology actively prevents involuntary churn have become key in preserving subscriber relationships For instance the renewal invoice paid rate the percentage of all renewal invoices that are paid in their final state came in at 96 in 2023 The median churn rate across all industries was 4 staying consistent year over year Recurly saved 72 of at risk subscribers using recovery events extending their subscription by a median of 141 days with 38 of a subscriber 's total lifetime happening after a recovery event In 2023 Recurly recovered $ 1.2 billion in subscription revenue through its churn management solutions using a full array of strategies combining years of transactional data to feed AI powered transaction retry models to predict and recover potentially lost revenue Recurly is excited to announce a major new platform feature built in benchmarks available to all customers It is an essential addition that allows our customers to directly compare key performance metrics against similar businesses within their industry This will offer a clear view of where they stand in the competitive subscription landscape over specific timelines says Rohrlich Built in benchmarks will be part of two new dashboards renewal invoice paid rate and renewal invoice decline rate Additional benchmarking metrics will be added in the coming months and will deliver comprehensive insights across subscriber acquisition and retention to help Recurly customers better gauge the health of their subscription businesses 3 Personalization is underutilized unique subscription offers boost loyalty An exceptional subscriber experience grants subscribers co ownership enabling them to create a subscription that aligns with their specific needs while allowing for future adjustments The ability to personalize the subscription offer plan length product price payment and promotion at scale can boost both revenues and relationships In 2023 28 of Recurly customers offered plan customizations to allow subscribers to personalize their subscriptions resulting in $ 2.2 billion in incremental revenue From 2020 to 2023 incremental revenue from product add ons increased by 272 for Recurly customers utilizing the feature The subscription pause feature gives subscribers the ability to temporarily suspend the subscription In 2023 40 of Recurly customers enabled pause demonstrating the widespread adoption of this feature to prevent cancellations 4 Payment types impact the subscriber experience improving the convenience and likelihood of successful payments Payments drive the subscriber experience and establish the framework for preferred payment methods affordability considerations and subscription payment success The most popular payment method was debit cards accounting for 46 of global transactions in Recurly Both debit and credit cards have grown in popularity since 2020 Although alternative payment methods APMs make up a small percentage of total transactions their significance is indisputable While PayPal only made up 19 of total transactions in Recurly in 2023 45 of respondents in our survey cited PayPal as their preferred payment method followed by credit cards 39 and ACH debit and checking account withdrawal 23 APMs presented a significantly lower risk of fraud < 1 when compared to credit 17 and debit cards 11 last year as many APMs offer additional security measures that

area of the Dolomites was The visit solidified her desire to create Pathways and share this type of memorable hiking experience with others I fell in love with this place and these mountains and with the friendly warm people the culture and the incredible food she said Costa Rica Emma Lasiuk visited Costa Rica in her junior year of college to volunteer near Manuel Antonio She fell in love with the country 's lush green fauna deep blue sea and pink and orange sunsets The local people or Ticos as they proudly call themselves won her heart next I had traveled extensively before visiting here but had never felt so warmly welcomed and safe said Lasiuk now a travel consultant with Costa Rican Vacations She embraced the Pura Vida lifestyle filling her days with hikes early morning beach swims and wildlife spotting When it was time to return to the United States she was terrified that Costa Rica would fade to a memory so much so that she instantly booked another trip and eventually moved there full time There is something for everyone in Costa Rica whether it be zip lining above the treetops in La Fortuna swaying on hanging bridges in the dense cloud forest of Monteverde jumping off waterfalls in the deep jungles of Manuel Antonio or diving off the Central Pacific coast at Ca\u00f1o Island she said I can not see myself living anywhere else Mississippi Madison Ned Butler communications manager with the Rail Passengers Association has seen most of the country through their long distance train travels but one destination in the South stood out Mississippi is beautiful complicated joyous bold and friendly they told HuffPost In 2019 Butler spent a week and a half traversing the Gulf Coast and exploring the Delta in awe of the state 's culture and communities The food music and art scenes are phenomenal right now I 've seen brilliant emerging talent from the state that has already produced many of our most acclaimed artists Butler said Perhaps their favorite part was visiting the various historical sites and museums including the Mississippi Freedom Trail and the Civil Rights Museum in nearby Memphis Tennessee There is a feeling of hopeful change with a recognition of history 's tragedies that I think is very conscious and beautiful Butler said I think everyone that lives in the U.S. should visit these sites and take that history in for themselves Ireland In 2006 Stephanie Chastain and her husband were looking for a destination for their honeymoon Chastain had never traveled internationally They chose Ireland because they 'd heard great things about the scenery and history Chastain now the founder of Infinite Ireland Travel Co. told HuffPost she was a goner from the moment she stepped off the plane She was most looking forward to the iconic sites like the Cliffs of Moher and Killarney National Park and while they were spectacular it was the people and the local sites that wound up being the most memorable for her She and her husband spent their days weaving though mom and pop shops visiting old tiny pubs and stumbling on hidden gems that were n't in their guidebooks such as the 300 A.D. stone fort sitting in the middle of a farmer 's field After that trip and a few return visits Chastain decided to help others experience authentic local Ireland People who travel to Ireland often try to zip around to all the iconic sites Chastain encourages people to go at a slower pace so they have time to meet the local people meander through lesser known spots and leave room for adventure Taiwan Nick Kembel a travel photographer and writer first visited Taiwan because he was curious to learn about a new destination He immediately felt welcomed he said locals help people navigate around and provide tips on cheap eats They 'll insist you try their grandma 's secret soup dumplings or point you toward hidden night market stalls that only locals know about Kembel said What sealed the deal for him though was the nature From the peaceful Sun Moon Lake to the dramatic Taroko Gorge every landscape told stories and hiking was seeing more magic Kembel said Petrified Forest National Park Arizona Chiara Salvadori via Getty Images Years ago Jim Pattiz a nature filmmaker and co founder of the organization More Than Just Parks took a spur of the moment summer road trip from his home in Atlanta to the Grand Canyon It ended up changing the course of his life Pattiz and his crew borrowed his grandmother 's Prius and drove straight through to New Mexico followed by a visit to Petrified Forest National Park in Arizona Having grown up in Georgia all I knew were woods and streams but here you could see beautiful summer storms rolling in miles and miles off in the distance Pattiz told HuffPost He recalls the blue mesas the striped hills and of course the petrified wood The vastness of it all awakened his senses he says and everything suddenly seemed so exciting and possible That feeling of enchantment and wide open possibilities is one I 've chased ever since in my travels all across America 's public lands he said",

    "summary": "NASA ABSTRACT breaks down mind bending scientific research future tech new discoveries and major breakthroughs Moon dust has fascinated scientists ever since Neil Armstrong scooped up a vial of the stuff back in 1969 The jagged and statically charged lunar dust provides clues about the moon 's early formation and tells us about our own geologic history and that of the inner solar system Now planetary scientists have discovered strange anomalies in sun reflecting particles covering meter wide moon rocks This research published in the Journal of Geophysical Research Planets could help scientists understand more about the processes that formed and changed the moon 's crust and created unexplained magnetic anomalies But for now at least the odd rocks and dust particles remain an unsolved mystery Researchers came across these extraterrestrial dust bunnies while trawling a catalog of images taken by NASA 's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft They used artificial intelligence to go through the more than a million images and narrow rocks of interest down to around 130000 We keep finding unknown objects in this way such as the anomalous rocks that we are investigating in this new study said study co author Valentin Bickel from the University of Bern in a press statement They saw that some rocks around the Reiner K crater a smaller impact crater near the larger Reiner crater on the western side of the moon had noticeable dark patches on them Normally lunar dust is very porous and reflects a lot of light back in the direction of illumination explained Marcel Hess an image analyst from the Technische Universit\u00e4t Dortmund However when the dust is compacted the overall brightness usually increases This is not the case with the observed dust covered rocks The team described the rocks strange light reflecting properties using a technique called photometric analysis which measures how light reflects off objects The researchers suspect that the dust covered boulders were dispersed as a result of the impact that formed the crater But not all of the boulders around the Reiner K crater were covered in the perplexing dust Just what this dust is and why it only settled on some rocks and not others is still a mystery The study 's authors theorize it could have to do with the physical features of the moon 's landscape something about the microscopic structure of the rocks themselves the static properties of the dust or the moon 's magnetic fields The Reiner Gamma region where the craters lie is a known magnetic hotspot The researchers hope that an upcoming NASA mission to the moon Lunar Vertex which will collect samples from the region will shed some light on the dusty enigma The mission will also map Reiner Gamma 's magnetic field to help uncover how parts of the moon got their distinctive swirls and bumps That will help planetary scientists understand not only how the moon formed but also other astronomical objects with thin or no atmosphere in our solar system Current knowledge of the moon 's magnetic properties is very limited These new rocks will shed light on the history of the Moon and its magnetic core said planetary geologist Ottaviano R\u00fcschso from the Universit\u00e4t M\u00fcnster in a statement Plus understanding how dust swooshes around the moon will be vital for planning future human settlements on the moon since moon dust is notorious for causing problems for habitats equipment and human lungs and brain cells",

    "summary": "The Killers of the Flower Moon star on how to curse in Blackfoot being nominated for an Oscar and the many Native actors she hopes will follow her February 4 2024 Photograph by Carlos Jaramillo Life was different for Lily Gladstone in the summer of 2020 She had built up a small but impressive r\u00e9sum\u00e9 in independent films including two by Kelly Reichardt Certain Women and First Cow But the pandemic had shut down the industry and she was worried about sustaining an acting career Gladstone who calls herself a bee nerd looked into applying for a seasonal job with the Department of Agriculture tracking murder hornets Then she got an invitation to meet Martin Scorsese over Zoom He was making a film based on David Grann 's book Killers of the Flower Moon about a series of mysterious deaths in Oklahoma in the nineteen twenties when the Osage Nation was flush with oil money Her performance in the film did n't just boost her career it has now earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress the first for a Native American woman The role of Mollie Kyle who lived from 1886 to 1937 is a tricky one She married Ernest Burkhart played by Leonardo DiCaprio a white man who conspired with his uncle William Hale Robert De Niro to knock off Mollie 's relatives in order to inherit her family 's headrights In the film Mollie suspects from the start that Ernest is after her money\u2014'Coyote wants money she teases him but she does n't divorce him until after his crimes are exposed in court Playing her scenes with DiCaprio one of the brightest stars in Hollywood Gladstone adopts a Mona Lisa smile ambiguity is central to her mesmerizing performance and much of it comes across without words And yet she resists the trope of the stoic suffering Native heroine She 's by turns flirtatious shrewd agonized ailing and clear eyed Anthony Lane in his New Yorker review called her unmistakably the most compelling presence in the movie Gladstone who is thirty seven was raised on the Blackfeet Reservation in Montana the daughter of a white mother and a father of Blackfeet and Nez Perce ancestry No acting career is a sure bet but Hollywood 's treatment of Native characters and performers has historically been worse than neglectful it 's been vilifying and insulting The Oscars in their nine and a half decade history have n't done much better In 1973 Sacheen Littlefeather was booed when she took the stage to criticize the industry 's representation of Native Americans at the behest of Marlon Brando A handful of Indigenous nominees have shown up in the acting categories most recently the Native Mexican actress Yalitza Aparicio Roma')\u2014but Gladstone walks a mostly untrodden path and she does it with composure and conviction When we spoke recently she was in Washington D.C. for a screening of Killers at the National Museum of the American Indian along with the Osage musician Scott George who is nominated for his original song Wahzhazhe A Song for My People There are a couple historic nominations this year and I 'm so happy that there 's an Osage making history too she said We spoke about her own historic nomination her passion for language revitalization and how to curse in Blackfoot Our conversation has been edited and condensed You 're in the heat of Oscar season What 's life like right now It 's a lot of nice hotels and a very rapid paced schedule It 's really lovely the reach that this film is having It 's been a lot of travel a lot of meeting new people Awards season is this huge machine As someone who 's been catapulted into it have you had moments that have felt particularly surreal or fun or stressful It does get to a point where you get a little overwhelmed by all of the celebrity and then pretty soon it 's just people you know Probably the most surreal moment was when I was at the National Board of Review awards Patti Smith made the introduction for my award and I was sitting between her and Daniel Day Lewis And then the next day I was at the A.F.I. luncheon in L.A. sitting between Tim Cook and Leo DiCaprio and I was telling Tim Why is it that today feels a little bit more grounded and familiar than yesterday When Tim Cook and Leo DiCaprio become Oh hey guys!'\u2014it 's a strange place to be The people you 've collaborated with on this movie are of course old hands at this kind of thing Leo Marty Bob not that I have any reason to call them by those names Have they given you any sort of advice on what to expect What I really appreciate is there 's not this protective patriarchal Let me give you advice kid sort of thing Anytime Leo 's done it it 's been completely self aware and joking He 's kind of a goofball and a wise ass They lead by example That 's been the most grounding thing because I 've been able to be in proximity to people who are so used to it And meeting other people I 'm just so excited by how quickly America Ferrera took to me I 'm a huge fan of Emma Stone and she 's been lovely and all of these people that are now in a peer group I guess You just get the sense that it 's not as big or scary as you need to make it It 's just about human connection in the end At the same time that you 're dressing up and going to award shows you 're also carrying the banner of a historic nomination The Oscars have had an extremely spotty record with honoring Indigenous people and you 're the first Native American woman in the Best Actress category How has that been sitting with you I keep saying it 's overdue We 're in the ninety sixth year of the Academy Awards and we 're on Native American land Natives are natural storytellers A big part of our understanding of ourselves since time immemorial is our stories So it 's just odd that in the United States it 's taken almost a hundred years for a Native American to reach this milestone in a major acting category We 've had Indigenous representation We 've had Yalitza Aparicio Graham Greene Dances with Wolves in supporting Chief Dan George Little Big Man in supporting We 've had global Indigenous recognition But like you said it 's sprinkled I 'm friends with Sterlin Harjo the co creator of Reservation Dogs We 're both in the circuit right now and we happened to find ourselves in the same hotel the week before last He put it really well He said We 're in a position where we 're kicking the door in When you kick the door in you should just put your foot in the door and stand there Kicking the door in and running through it means it 's going to shut behind you While I 'm the first specifically Native American Indigenous woman I stand on the shoulders of a lot of performers It 's all circumstantial that I have this moniker of the first and I 'm certainly not going to be the last If I 've kicked the door in I 'm just trying to stand here and leave it open for everybody else As a student of Oscar history I know that it 's been a mixed experience for people who have been the firsts in their categories Sidney Poitier was the first Black man to win Best Actor in 1964 and when he was being honored at the mayor 's office in New York City reporters kept asking him about civil rights He finally snapped he was not a person who generally snapped and said Why is it everything you guys ask refers to the Negroness of my life and not my acting I 'm curious if you 've felt that tension of being out here as an actor but also as the face of a community And in addition to that you 're playing an Osage woman so it 's not even quite your community That 's something that I try to highlight first There 's just the roadblock that a lot of Natives have in representation that people do n't even think we 're still here There 's some empirical data out there some surveys in one study I was reading forty per cent of people did n't think that Native Americans still existed The perception of who we are which has largely been shaped by Hollywood it 's very narrow There 's an assumption that we just disappeared There 's an incredible diversity in Indian country I 'm not Osage but as a Native actor I 've played a lot of roles now that required that I speak another Indigenous language And I 'm by no means even fluent in Blackfoot I can introduce myself I have a few words and phrases I know some of the bad words Can you please curse in Blackfoot right now I 'm just gon na drop this for my Blackfeet folks but I 'm not going to say what it means Siksimiisii was one of the worst and funniest things you could say about somebody It 's a fairly PG thing but it 's my favorite word in our language Good luck trying to phonetically transcribe it Another film that I did last year was Fancy Dance which premi\u00e8red at Sundance Isabel Deroy Olson the actress who plays my niece and I were playing Seneca Cayuga and our director and co writer Erica Tremblay is Seneca Cayuga Erica was going through a three year long language revitalization program and wanted to make a film where she saw modern characters speaking Cayuga So when Isabel and I were at this talkback a woman very sweetly asked if it felt good for us to be able to speak in our native language And Isabel and I looked at each other Neither of us is Seneca Cayuga It was really difficult for us to pick up the language and to get to the point where we could act in it as well Tribal languages are incredibly different from each other The perception that we all speak one Native American language is very commonly held Most of us are not fluent even in our own languages That 's an aspect of Native performance that I think a lot of people take for granted We celebrate other actors for picking up European languages for a role and sounding proficient but for some reason that same awe and credit are often dismissed for Native actors because people assume Oh you all speak that In your Golden Globes speech you talked about how your mother had advocated for your school to teach Blackfoot when you were growing up Can you tell me a little bit about that It was in second grade when the educator Edward North Peigan came into our classroom I did n't really know what my mom was up to I just knew that she was doing everything she could to help in community building and she had a degree in early childhood education She remembers having to find the funding to pay for a language teacher to come in The school was fairly mixed majority Blackfeet students but a lot of non Blackfeet students so there was a little bit of pushback And my mom was saying Well we 're on Blackfeet land and most of your students are Blackfeet and it 's important for brain development it 's important for sense of self it 's important for connection to community I 'm so grateful to her My dad would come into the classroom and record when Edward was speaking so that we would have an archive of some of our language But I just remember sitting there and learning how to count learning how to introduce ourselves As you were growing up on the Blackfeet Reservation what sort of art or culture called out to you I 've said it a lot now Return of the Jedi and my love of Ewoks gave me the early spark to want to be an actor Missoula Children 's Theatre is a touring company and they take plays to schools all across the country especially in smaller rural areas They 're in residence for a week and do a big play for the community So I loved that But I also remember when Edward and his wife Wilma were coming to school and teaching language Every year you put on your little school play and I think a lot of people were pushing for a Nativity play And the pushback was Well while we have this grant to have Edward and Wilma in our schools maybe we ought to do a different story So we staged a trickster story our trickster figure He 's also a creator of our world A lot of these stories they 're fun for kids but they 're also teaching you these sacred world building lessons There was an element of the story where the trickster is being chased by this giant rock rolling down a hill and all of these nighthawks come in to try to save him and they break apart this big rolling boulder by throwing their feces So I remember being one of these little nighthawks just pummelling one of my classmates dressed as a rock with these little balled up pieces of paper and how fun that was for all the kids and how triggering it was for a lot of the more conservative families the non Blackfeet folks Our stories do n't move the same way Western stories do They do n't have the same lessons That was a really foundational experience in early childhood as far as performance goes Your high school yearbook has made the rounds online so I know that you were voted Most Likely to Win an Oscar It 's really sweet My graduating class and a lot of people that were in the same drama program they're reuniting to watch the Oscars in our old high school theatre And then Josh Ryder who 's the other classmate that was voted Most Likely to Win an Oscar he 's still a brilliant actor He 's a restaurateur now Anybody in Seattle go check out Betty Restaurant Bar on Queen Anne It 's the best Shoutout Little shoutout to Betty I was really more involved in my sophomore and junior years My senior year this is silly I wanted to do more complex work than high school would allow for So I jumped over to the community college where my mom was teaching But growing up back home after Missoula Children 's Theatre shows people would tell my parents that when they saw me like in full costume playing one of Cinderella 's ugly stepsisters they did n't recognize me I disappeared into character My identity at home and then in high school became synonymous with acting Then you studied acting and directing at the University of Montana When you got out what was your early career like What kind of roles were you auditioning for what were you getting and what kind of day jobs were you doing for survival My dad gave me a little piece of knowledge that until recently I thought was a Blackfeet saying Prey runs to the hunter Turns out it comes from Carl Sagan In Intelligent Life in the Universe Sagan credits the line to the Soviet astronomer Iosif Samuilovich Shklovskii Which is really cool too But my career has kind of been shaped that way I graduated already cast into a touring theatre production with Montana Repertory Theatre which is a company attached to the University of Montana actor training program So I went out for a year with To Kill a Mockingbird and played Mrs. Dubose the ninety year old morphine addict Oh nice Then I had a costume transition in the intermission and played a lady in the court I also doubled as crew so it gave me a holistic sense of what it is to bring a production together After that I decided to stay in Montana instead of going to L.A. or New York My scene work in class was always praised but I also got a little bit disillusioned with the whole casting process If I had gone to L.A. or New York and done the classic route]\u2014audition endlessly get an agent just thinking about it was starting to kill my passion for it So I stayed in Montana where I had built some connections with local filmmakers In between the theatre tours I auditioned for a one woman show that toured schools Oh I read about this And you were acting against a prerecorded track in school auditoriums Yeah It 's a Seattle based company called Living Voices and I was performing a show that was teaching about the Native American boarding school experience with historical documents projected behind you on the screen and prerecorded voices from other actors that etch out this period in history You act as a person who 's living through it for about twenty minutes",

    "summary": "The Conversation is an independent and nonprofit source of news analysis and commentary from academic experts THE CONVERSATION Boulder Colorado passed stricter regulations against plastic bags at the beginning of 2024 banning them from all retail stores The tougher rule builds on a 2013 local law that banned plastic bags from grocery stores and began charging shoppers 10 cents for every paper bag they required at checkout The new law part of the state 's Plastic Pollution Reduction Act also prohibits restaurants and retail food establishments from using Styrofoam takeout containers The Conversation interviewed Eleanor Putnam Farr an assistant professor of marketing at Rice University and co author of Forgot Your Bottle or Bag Again How Well Placed Reminder Cues Can Help Consumers Build Sustainable Habits about the challenges of changing people 's behavior even when their intentions are good How popular are plastic bag bans and taxes Laws like Boulder 's are popular Twelve states plus Puerto Rico and more than 300 municipalities including Philadelphia have banned plastic bag use by consumers Charging a fee for bags is less common but rules like this are in effect in Washington D.C. Honolulu Hawaii Santa Fe New Mexico and other U.S. cities And these types of regulations are n't limited to the U.S. Many other countries are also cracking down on plastic bag use including China Namibia and Portugal Cities and towns have tried a lot of strategies from educating consumers to banning the use of bags or just nudging them to do the right thing by imposing small fees Nudges leave the choice up to the consumer and are often more palatable than outright bans Many cities have reported decreases in plastic bag use after imposing plastic bag bans and fees but the effects may be small In a study on the efficacy of a bag fee implemented in Toronto researchers found a 3.4 increase in the use of reusable bags mostly among higher income customers Maybe Research on parents who were assessed fees when they picked up their children late at 10 different day care centers found that small charges actually led to a big increase in tardy parents who apparently felt they were paying for the right to be late Boulder may be fighting the same sort of complacency Disposable bag fees collected from 2013 through 2022 fluctuated slightly year to year but increased more often than not suggesting that people are buying more bags not fewer Earning 6 cents for every bag sold the stores keep the rest Boulder brought in US$ 243507 in tax revenue in 2021 and $ 248518 in 2022 Why do n't more consumers use reusable bags Consumers stick to plastic bags for many reasons including convenience Research on farmers market shoppers in Ohio suggests accidentally leaving reusable bags in their cars or at home is an obstacle and some consumers prefer plastic bags because they reuse them for trash and pet waste But researchers from Chile which enacted a complete ban on plastic bags in 2019 found that people there at first were n't committed to reusable bags Consumers in Chile felt pressured to change their behavior and guilty when they did n't comply They also felt like 100 of the burden of sustainability was forced on them all of which undermined the goal of the ban What does work to encourage consumers to use reusable bags The most important thing is to understand that most people do n't set out to use more plastic So the best solutions help consumers achieve their goals and make access to reusable bags easier The key is to determine the biggest impediment to shoppers bringing reusable bags In our research about reusable bottles my colleagues at the Yale Center for Customer Insights and at Google knew that most employees of the office site had reusable bottles but forgot to bring them to the water stations to refill them Instead of banning plastic cups or disposable bottles we created reminders and placed them near the workers desks These reminders helped people behave the way they wanted to behave and had the added benefit of making the people feel good about the overall process which can be its own reward The same can work for reusable bags even without imposing bans or fines If people do n't have reusable bags make them available If people are forgetting their bags in the cars create reminders in the parking lot If people are leaving their bags at home supply bag hooks they can place near their doors These create easy visual reminders to grab the shopping bags on their way out of the house",

    "summary": "The nearly 7000 square foot home known as Tirranna and designed by Frank Lloyd Wright has landed a buyer Closing earlier this week for $ 6 million the house in New Canaan CT was listed last May with an $ 8 million asking price The seven bedroom 8.5 bath home was built in 1956 and sits on 14 bucolic acres And that pedigree is what attracted the buyers The buyers are fans of Frank Lloyd Wright architecture Safdie says You could tell that from how well informed they were about the property on their first visit They researched the history and gathered information from archived documents They knew everything about it they pointed out some of the original room setups and referred to original floor plans Wright 's signature Usonian style homes are mostly ranch level and crafted from Philippine mahogany as this one is These houses also follow nearly the same layout with a bedroom wing wall of windows and a fireplace in the open concept living and dining areas plus heated flooring and built ins throughout Included with this property is a guest studio large barn tennis court and pool Other unique features include a rooftop observatory and a wine cellar born out of a bomb shelter They loved the trails around the house and mentioned they would like to expand a trail on the back of the property which extends uphill to a giant boulder says Safdie of the buyers plans for the lot Landscape architect Frank Okamura designed the grounds which include a waterfall The Japanese gardens at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden is among the late Okamura 's projects We had great interest in the house and several offers Safdie says noting that some were eying the place as a primary residence and others were considering it as a country home Buyers came from varied locations but primarily from the New York metropolitan area The current owners elected Tirranna to be their primary residence The sale is significant for a few reasons First it 's among the higher priced Wright properties to be sold in the last few years While the Ennis House in Los Angeles sold for $ 18 million in 2019 most Wright designed homes sell for far less Also this ranks as one of the most expensive properties sold in New Canaan in the last year according to Coldwell Banker Global Luxury with which Safdie and Marsha Charles co listed the property Chau Ngo of the Jennifer Leahy Team at Douglas Elliman secured the buyer in the deal Wright was at a high point in his career when he designed this project simultaneously working on the Guggenheim Museum in New York City and even living in this house during that period In fact some of the famed museum 's scalloped glass windows were used to build this property 's greenhouse",

    "title": "How to spend the perfect day in Berkeley CA",
    "excerpt": "Known for its university and its radical history this East Bay college town also offers fun shopping easy access to nature great food and diverse music",
    "summary": "For a small city Berkeley California has a remarkably large presence in American culture That 's in part because of its role as the site of the early Free Speech Movement and related anti Vietnam War protests the Asian American movement the country 's first dog park and so many more firsts and cultural touchstones In many ways Berkeley has become a paragon of liberal American culture an early adopter of policies such as soda taxes and plastic bag bans that then catch on in the rest of the world These days Berkeley is perhaps best known for being the home of the renowned University of California campus founded here in 1868 But while the university has loomed large in many of the cultural moments that have made the city famous there 's so much more to Berkeley than just Cal an abundance to do see eat and explore Here 's a list of our favorite things to do in Berkeley CA Wander around campus Yes Berkeley is more than its campus but the university is still a great place to start there 's plenty to see here even if you do n't have a student ID From main thoroughfare Oxford Street walk through the eucalyptus grove on the Grinnell Pathway stopping to take a few deep breaths and appreciating the peace that emanates from these towering giants From there you can poke into the picturesque Doe Library picnic on one of the campus many green lawns or stroll around the classically beautiful Faculty Glade Be sure to finish off your visit with a ride up 307 foot Sather Tower also known as the Campanile UC Berkeley 's most famous symbol and a great place to enjoy views across the Bay and into Oakland Keep an ear out for the tower 's famous carillon program which delights visitors and students with music that can be heard across campus three times a day Find it Sather Tower is located in the heart of UC Berkeley campus between Doe Library and Faculty Glade It is open Monday Friday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturday from 1 5 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. and 3 5 p.m. closed for the 2 p.m. carillon concert Learn about local history Before you leave campus make a stop at the Free Speech Movement Cafe where you can learn about the history of the movement and grab a latte or a sandwich For important insight into local Indigenous history check to see if Ohlone restaurant o\u1e6d\u1e6doy is open at the Hearst Anthropology Museum or go see co owners Vincent Medina and Louis Trevino at one of their regular speaking engagements around Berkeley and the Bay At the time of writing o\u1e6d\u1e6doy planned to re open in spring 2024 staying open each spring fall and summer and closing in the rainy season Medina and Trevino have used their two restaurants Cafe Ohlone and o\u1e6d\u1e6doy to bring the foodways of the Ohlone community to the mainstream served with a mix of modern elegance and down home deliciousness and often accompanied by a cultural or language lesson If you ca n't try the food see if your schedule matches up with Medina and Trevino 's monthly talk at the Berkeley Public Library To soak in some off campus history sign up for a South Asian Radical History Walking Tour which explores the lesser known history of the area 's Indian Pakistani and Bangladeshi immigrant communities When the world descended on California in the 1850s for the gold rush South Asians came too Historians Anirvan Chatterjee and Barnali Ghosh take visitors through 120 years and two miles of history with a particular focus on exploring how these communities have supported the activist causes of their new home Top it all off with a guaranteed to be adorable stop by the world 's first dog park at Ohlone Park The work of the same activists who created People 's Park which the university has now closed for construction Ohlone Park was created to be an off leash space where dogs are free be dogs See if you can find the memorial fire hydrant inscribed to Doris Richards a beloved dog park leader Go shopping Lots may have changed in Berkeley since the heady 1960s and 70s but the town 's famous Telegraph Avenue has retained at least a glimmer of its counterculture vibe For maximum blast from the past feel while away the hours in a maze of stacks at Moe 's Books sift through vinyl at OG music store Amoeba or see if any of the older hippies at the Telegraph Avenue Chess Club are at their Telegraph Avenue and Haste Street meeting spot If you 're hungry the street continues to serve students with a remarkable variety of cuisines from banh mi to Burmese burgers to bubble tea plus delicious custom ice cream sandwiches If gritty hippie is n't really your vibe head over to more upscale and family oriented Solano Avenue technically just over the border in Albany or the sleek boutiques along Fourth Street Or for a quintessential Berkeley experience stop in at Berkeley Bowl The grocery store is a beloved institution whose riot of colorful diverse and affordable produce makes for a unique and entertaining way to plan a meal or grab a snack Hit up a museum A town that loves learning as much as Berkeley does must have great museums and the ones here do n't disappoint Follow your nose to the Aftel Archive of Curious Scents where more than 200 natural essences from fruits flowers trees grasses and resins are on display along with artifacts and books about the history of perfumery Then head up the hill to Lawrence Hall of Science at UC Berkeley which has interactive exhibits on seismic forces DNA and the flight dynamics of paper airplanes For a slightly different take on science spend an afternoon at the Berkeley Natural History Museums which features exhibits on entomology zoology and paleontology Or if you 're less of a science nerd and more of a film buff check out the Berkeley Art Museum and Pacific Film Archive known as BAMPFA which folds stunning modern art into exhibits about movie history and offers a film series showing movies from masters like Werner Herzog as well as from modern filmmakers from across the globe Bask in the great outdoors Like much of the Bay Area Berkeley is set against a backdrop of stunning hills vivid green in springtime burnished gold in summer and fall Both locals and visitors have access to a huge variety of beautiful public spaces to enjoy the great outdoors If you love flowers and plants the Berkeley Rose Garden and UC Berkeley Botanical Garden are full of fascinating and gorgeous specimens The Rose Garden is most beautiful in May when blooms are at their height check out the carnivorous plants at the Botanical Garden 's Tropical House or the gorgeous redwood grove any time of year To see a huge diversity of flora out in the wild head to Tilden Regional Park where the Seaview Trail the child sized steam train and a 1911 carousel are especially beloved Elsewhere in the hills Berkeley 's many rock parks offer a distinctive slice of the East Bay outdoors The area 's unique geology provides lots of opportunities for scrambling or bouldering and rock climbing if you 're more experienced Head to Cragmont Rock Park for a good beginner climbing spot and Indian Rock Park for unmatched sunset views no climbing skills required Visit C\u00e9sar Ch\u00e1vez Park at the Berkeley Marina to appreciate San Francisco Bay up close Fly a kite listen to the waves splash along the sea wall rent kayaks grab a drink or dinner at beloved institution Skates on the Bay or get a visitors pass and play captain at Cal Sailing Club Enjoy the show After sunset immerse yourself in all that Berkeley by night has to offer On campus Zellerbach Hall hosts world class lectures theater and music from classical to modern Off campus if you 're in the mood for theater try Shotgun Players which often features new work from up and coming playwrights or look up what 's playing at local theater the Berkeley Rep. Down the hill the UC Theater hosts a slate of diverse international musicians from as far away as Mali and as close as the Bay Area while Cornerstone caters to the student crowd with a mix of hipster rock Americana and R B. The Starry Plough which has been around for half a century still enthusiastically hosts poetry slams and Irish sessions Equally longstanding next door neighbor La Pe\u00f1a Cultural Center offers salsa rumba bachata singing and dancing classes and parties supporting a rich community of Latinx musicians from around California and beyond Grand dame Freight Salvage has been hosting traditional music which started as folk roots and bluegrass and has come to encompass genres from across the globe since 1968 Devoted event organizer Harold Adler brings it home at the still underground Art House whose collection of psychedelic dayglo prints 1960s and 70s concert posters and vintage vinyl mix perfectly with an eclectic lineup of musicians playing Grateful Dead inspired jams and underground punk It 's a vibe that 's perfectly Berkeley both then and now",

    "excerpt": "Pardon us while we go stock up on toilet tank disinfectant dispensers",
    "summary": "Whether the toilet lid is up or down does n't make much difference in the spread of airborne bacterial and viral particles File this one under Studies We Wish Had Let Us Remain Ignorant Scientists at the University of Arizona decided to investigate whether closing the toilet lid before flushing reduces cross contamination of bathroom surfaces by airborne bacterial and viral particles via toilet plumes The bad news is that putting a lid on it does n't result in any substantial reduction in contamination according to their recent paper published in the American Journal of Infection Control The good news Adding a disinfectant to the toilet bowl before flushing and using disinfectant dispensers in the tank significantly reduce cross contamination Regarding toilet plumes we 're not just talking about large water droplets that splatter when a toilet is flushed Even smaller droplets can form and be spread into the surrounding air potentially carrying bacteria like E. coli or a virus e.g. norovirus if an infected person has previously used said toilet Pathogens can linger in the bowl even after repeated flushes just waiting for their chance to launch into the air and spread disease That 's because larger droplets in particular can settle on surfaces before they dry while smaller ones travel further on natural air currents The first experiments examining whether toilet plumes contained contaminated particles were done in the 1950s and the notion that disease could be spread this way was popularized in a 1975 study In 2022 physicists and engineers at the University of Colorado Boulder managed to visualize toilet plumes of tiny airborne particles ejected from toilets during a flush using a combination of green lasers and cameras It made for some pretty vivid video footage If it 's something you ca n't see it 's easy to represent it does n't exist study co author John Grimaldi said at the time They found that the ejected airborne particles could travel up to 6.6 feet per second reaching heights of 4.9 feet above the toilet within 8 seconds And if those particles were smaller less than 5 microns they could hang around in that air for over a minute More relevant to this latest paper it 's been suggested that closing the lid before flushing could substantially reduce the airborne spread of contaminants For example in 2019 researchers at University College Cork deployed bioaerosol sensors in a shared lavatory for a week to monitor the number and size of contaminant particles They concluded that flushing with the toilet lid down reduced airborne droplets between 30 and 60 percent But this scenario also increased the diameter of the droplets and bacteria concentration Leaving the lid down also means the airborne microdroplets are still detectable 16 minutes after flushing 11 minutes longer than if one flushed with the lid up",

    "summary": "Care and Feeding is Slate 's parenting advice column Have a question for Care and Feeding Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group Dear Care and Feeding The last time my husband and I visited his parents we had a big conflict My son was 18 months old and without explaining where we were going he told us we were going on a nice short trip'\u2014he took us all on a very dangerous boulder hopping trip in their not so recreational vehicle My son cried the whole time as we dodged branches and tried to stay upright as the tiny vehicle swayed left to right I was furious I confronted him afterwards and he brushed it off as no big deal That night he made some very passive aggressive comments to my son about our reaction so we packed up and left early the next morning We have n't been back since We 've since had another baby My MIL was pretty helpful staying at our house through the labor until I came home She took time off work and tried to be as helpful as she could Just after that though my husband and MIL got into a big fight which they never do When he asked her to come for a night to help bring him to a doctor appointment she said she would only if we brought our newborn and 2 year old to an upcoming family reunion Thirty people would be there many having traveled so because of Covid we kindly said we were n't comfortable with that arrangement and we 'd find an alternative ride My MIL blew up I removed her from my social media accounts but send daily pics of the grandkids This crushed her She went off the map with intense sadness texting that she was crying all day We met with her a couple of times to discuss new boundaries We will never force the kids to do something unless it 's best for them first we have to have an open dialogue from now on about feelings if she wants time with the kids she needs to initiate it We also listed a number of dangerous situations Grandpa put our toddler in and admitted we were avoiding visiting them and would continue to do so until he could assure us that he would keep things age appropriate for them for now on She secretly recorded us during the meeting and told us afterwards she was showing Grandpa the recording His response was that he would not change no matter what but wanted to think it through Whatever that means Cut to today five months later My relationship with my MIL is cold and distant She comes down to visit takes our now 3 year old out on Grandma trips and leaves the next day I do n't go out of my way to make her feel needed or included I also do n't like her and I 'm open about that to my husband which has caused conflict Since our open dialogue about open dialogues nothing 's changed When she visits it 's for the kids and that 's it I do n't feel like I can trust her again and I honestly do n't want to try but I feel like it 's just a dark cloud following us now What more can I do End of My Rope Dear End I have no issues with you putting down boundaries for the safety and comfort of your children and I also do n't necessarily object to the social media blocking even though I 'd have probably taken a different approach I would have been just as frustrated as you that my posts and parenting choices were being used against me And recording you secretly to share with Grandpa was even if she did n't realize it pretty brazen I 'd be icy for a long time after that But I do take issue if MIL is making the effort to play by the rules and you are n't extending her an olive branch in return Her conduct has not been perfect but your husband has made it clear that he wants to keep a relationship with her So I think the question is n't what more can you do but what are you willing to do going forward It 's hard to tell from your letter what you want from the relationship You say you do n't like her but you are resentful that her visits are only about the kids and nothing more You say nothing has changed but she is making an effort to come spend time with your toddler initiated by her according to your wishes and has not pressured you to see more of the family You expect her to have open dialogue about her feelings but you admit to not making her feel wanted in your home I m not trying to be combative I completely understand that your trust was violated by both Grandpa and MIL I 'm just confused about what it is that you want your relationship to be My mom has always reminded me when I am struggling with family relationships that as the mother of the grandkids nephews etc I hold the power I am the gatekeeper for whether people see my kids But with that power comes the responsibility to be gracious and magnanimous whenever possible I think you need to paint the picture for yourself of what your ideal yet realistic relationship with your MIL looks like and then identify what steps you can take to get there If you do n't want to be closer to her than you are now then accept your current situation and do n't hold it against her If you want things to be warmer you 'll need to make the first overture Invite her to stay for a cup of coffee after her Grandma trip and chit chat just the two of you If she declines offer the next time and the next Thank her for playing with your son Start a dialogue of reconciliation and open sharing rather than putting that onus on her Relationships are made of these kinds of little moments and that 's where I think you need to begin New Year Same Problems For an upcoming special edition of Care and Feeding we want to hear about the messy situations plaguing you that you 'd like to shed in the new year A pet fox corrupting daughter A 10 year old behind the wheel Harsh PTA crackdowns Submit your questions anonymously here Questions may be edited for publication Dear Care and Feeding How do I regain my 3 year old 's trust About two weeks ago my friend Bob was visiting Bob has a liver condition and carries medication for it the sort of stuff that is toxic if taken in the wrong dose Well my son Albert got into the medicine bottle Childproof Ha and swallowed some he was n't sure how much I quickly ran out to the corner store to get an emetic and gave it to Albert in the car I told him it was candy because I did n't want to waste any time The emetic worked Albert threw up all over and physically he 's been fine However he remembers how I tricked him and now wo n't accept anything from me If I want to give him something I have to give it to my wife and have her give it to him She thinks he 'll forget about it in a little while but it 's already been two weeks and he has n't shown any signs of it yet Am I ever going to be able to fix this Feeling Failure Dear FF When my son was two he ate his three year old cousin 's cookie which greatly put her out Six months later she would still mention The Incident whenever my son 's name came up I think now 18 months later she 's forgotten Probably That anecdote aside yes your son will eventually forget and I do n't think it will take 18 months But there are probably some things you can do to mend the bridge sooner I think you have two paths you could take depending on what you 've already tried and your kid 's disposition Path one lean into his refusal by making your wife the sole thing giver for a period of several weeks You could even casually eat things he loves when he 's around which your wife and others might accept from you Hopefully as he sees others interact with you during this period he 'll start to come around Alternatively you could address the situation head on by copping to the lie apologizing and making a pact about how you 'll handle medicine in the future You still may have to have the conversation several times before he lets it drop Remember that this was a major life event for him so it 's natural that he takes a while to process it Finally just a note of solidarity to you It is always such a bummer when a parenting move backfires Try to console yourself with what a laugh you 'll get out of this when Albert is older Catch Up on Care and Feeding If you missed Sunday 's column read it here Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group Dear Care and Feeding I am a single mother with an 8 year old son Dan We 're very close with my brother and his family My brother has two daughters who are 10 and 7 The younger one Lily uses a wheelchair She has very thick glasses that do n't fully correct her vision to 20/20 and has poor peripheral vision She also has ADHD and anxiety which she received treatment for and manages well Lily and Dan have a lot of the same interests and get along really well They call themselves best friends Because of my work schedule Dan usually goes to my brother 's house every day after school and plays with her However Dan often expresses his frustrations to me about all the fun things he wants to do with Lily that he ca n't because of her disabilities He also feels guilty about feeling frustrated about this Recently I took them to a science museum and both Lily and Dan were fascinated by a lot of the exhibits Unfortunately some exhibits involved things that Lily could n't do in her wheelchair Dan felt uncomfortable participating in them when he knew Lily could n't When he came home he vented to me about how he wished Lily 's legs would just start working correctly so that they could do all the fun stuff he wants to do with her Dan is usually understanding of Lily 's physical limitations and neurodivergent quirks when he 's with her I find their friendship really cute It 's also convenient for me because as a single mother I often rely on my brother 's family my brother his wife and his wife 's mother who does a lot of childcare for the family for childcare I do n't feel like I should talk about Dan 's frustrations with my brother or his family They 've expressed in the past that they are so grateful that Dan is friends with her and that he sees Lily as a person and not as a wheelchair Being reduced to one 's disabilities is apparently something a lot of disabled children face growing up How can I guide my son on his relationship with his best friend Inclusion Matters Dear Inclusion You are right that a lot of people with disabilities no matter their age do indeed face an incredible amount of reduction to their disability in society Discrimination invisibility and abuse are also pervasive challenges that people with disabilities face on a daily basis For a sobering and really insightful glimpse into life with a disability I highly recommend Disability Visibility a collection of essays edited by Alice Wong But just because people are treated unkindly for their disabilities does n't mean a disability should n't be acknowledged at all The fact of the matter is Lily 's mobility disability does mean that Dan ca n't share certain experiences with her It 's unfortunate but it 's also a fact and one that Lily is aware of too It is OK for Dan to be disappointed by this fact and vent to you about it It 's not OK for him to express that disappointment to Lily but I can tell from your letter that you and your son already know that Think about it this way there are a lot of things about our friends abilities and limits that can frustrate us not just disabilities For example your opposite sex friend 's mom does n't allow coed sleepovers or you ca n't take a certain friend to the pool because they ca n't swim etc Having a disability is just one of many things that make up our identities and it is OK to acknowledge its impact One way you can turn that disappointment into a constructive exercise is to help Dan make a list of cool things he wants to experience that Lily can also do and try some of those If those activities involve places like museums rides trails etc you can check out the destination 's accessibility information resources so that Dan and you know ahead of time what attractions will be successful available to your whole group So long as it 's OK with her parents involve Lily in the planning too One of the things that able bodied people tend to do around people with disabilities is to clam up or make assumptions when they do n't know how to handle a person 's disability Disabilities are not Voldemort it is OK to talk about them or ask how you can help in a specific situation Asking Lily directly is this something you 'd be able to do or would you want help doing this gives her the same sense of agency and autonomy that you and I might take for granted Since he sounds like an intellectual kid you might also point out to Dan that it 's really not the disability he 's upset about it 's how certain things in society do n't enable Lily to participate It 's not so much that people with disabilities ca n't engage fully in the world it 's that we have n't built our spaces to fully engage people with disabilities If when he can understand that distinction he 'll be less susceptible to feeling resentment and may instead turn into an ally or advocate for social change as he grows up I wish you the best Dear Care and Feeding I need advice on getting a 3 and a half year old out the door in the morning By all accounts he likes preschool and comes home happy But mornings are a nightmare I do everything possible the n",

TSXV SGC Solstice we our or the Company is pleased to provide an update on the exploration program at its Church and Kamuck Projects in the Quetico Subprovince located approximately 85 km and 200 km NE of Thunder Bay Ontario respectively in the actively explored Quetico lithium district Emerging Quetico Lithium District Spodumene discoveries reported by exploration groups in 2023 are defining a greatly expanded area with high lithium potential within the Quetico subprovince The Quetico Lithium District is centred around the Georgia Lake Lithium deposit owned by Rock Tech In 2023 a new spodumene discovery was reported by Pegmatite One PGA 1 west of the Georgia Lake pegmatites and within 15 km of Solstice 's Church Property Spodumene was also reported in 2023 to the east of Georgia Lake by Tearlach TEA on their Georgina Properties 2 immediately adjacent to Solstice 's Gathering Lake claims optioned to Green Technology Metals Solstice 's Kamuck Property is located just to the east of these discoveries and exhibits abundant fertility indicators Principal Findings Pablo McDonald Solstice CEO stated After discovering several 20 to 30 m wide pegmatites on the Church Property on the first few days of prospecting our more in depth exploration efforts throughout the fall showed a trend of lithium enrichment in alkali feldspars across the southern part of the property as well as radiometric anomalies that are similar to those seen proximal to spodumene bearing pegmatites in the region We have also seen abundant pegmatite on both Kamuck and Church with promising LIBS readings in an unknown mineral of up to 3.0 Li 2 O. The combination of positive signs coming out of these properties after initial prospecting show that these areas have the potential to host LCT Pegmatites and I 'm therefore very excited to get back on the ground with detailed prospecting and sampling Both properties produced favourable results in 2023 which continues to show promise for Solstice 's projects in the Quetico Lithium District Preliminary exploration at Church in August of 2023 covering less than 5 of the area delineated five 12 30m wide pegmatites with quartz albite and potassium feldspar along with books of muscovite garnet and beryl or fluorapatite 3 High Lithium values in alkali feldspars 50 280 ppm using LIBS 4 define a lithium enriched trend along the Southern end of Church This trend largely aligns with the anomalies in radiometric data which continue to the north of Church and are spatially related to the Pegmatite One spodumene occurrence LIBS analysis of unknown minerals at both Church and Kamuck have registered strong lithium responses At Church readings of up to 1.18 Li 2 O in an unknown mineral are coincident with the southern radiometric anomaly At Kamuck readings of up to 3.0 Li 2 O in a green mineral likely fluorapatite were recorded after only one day of prospecting 5 Detailed Results Further exploration of the area included prospecting and sampling throughout the fall of 2023 whole rock geochemical and LIBS analysis Further study of publicly available geological and geophysical data has also helped to reveal promising geochemical and structural trends related to pegmatites on the Project Key results include Analysis of Ontario Geological Survey OGS radiometric data 6 show Equivalent Uranium eU anomalies that are related to a major structure the Black Sturgeon River Fault BSRF and related faults which are also developed near Pegmatite One 's recent spodumene discovery and other known pegmatites in the area see Figure 1 The eU anomalies are interpreted by Solstice to be associated with a potassic granite source intrusion(s which may also be the source of related pegmatites on the Property Some pegmatites in the area are known to be uranium bearing 7 Geochemical analysis using LIBS has identified a lithium enriched trend of over 50 ppm Li in alkali feldspars 50 280ppm from potassic granites or pegmatites Similar readings in alkali feldspars have been shown to be reliable indicators for the presence of spodumene in known lithium districts 89 Sampling to date at Church suggests that elevated lithium in alkali feldspars is largely coincident with the pronounced eU anomaly More regionally the Pegmatite One spodumene occurrence and mapped OGS fertile pegmatites also display a close spatial relationship with eU anomalies see inset Figure 1 eU anomalies coincident with lithium enrichment in alkali feldspars at Church suggest potential fractionation outwards from core potassic and uranium enriched source intrusion area(s This is supported by low K Rb ratios a measure of fractionation in pegmatites sampled to date outside the main area of eU enrichment Figure 1 LIBS analysis in an unknown mineral has registered readings of up to 5470ppm Li 1.18 Li 2 O in a newly identified area of pegmatites in the SE area of the Project Figure 1 Church Project exploration results Much of the Church Property has not been prospected or sampled Based on the promising results that are clearly tied to eU anomalies that have analogs to the North along the BSRF these areas have the potential to host LCT Pegmatites and therefore the next step on the Property will be to cover the rest of this area with detailed prospecting and sampling Kamuck Property Solstice acquired the 31 km 2 Kamuck Property in October 2023 after a one day property due diligence examination Key observations include Confirmation of a well exposed pegmatite swarm covering a 1 km by 800 m area which was initially identified using aerial imagery Figure 2 The pegmatite is typically coarse grained plagioclase feldspar with abundant indicators of fertility including books of muscovite garnet cordierite and possible fluorapatite 10 The pegmatite swarm correlates with a pronounced ENE and NNE trending 3.9 km long eU radiometric anomaly 1 1 that satellite imagery shows has extensive exposure Elevated Li content LIBS readings of up to 3.0 Li 2 O in a green mineral likely fluorapatite 1 2 According to Selway et.al the presence of blue or green Mn rich fluorapatite indicates that the pegmatite has economic potential for Li Cs Ta 1 3 The fluorapatite also contains up to 1.02 Mn 1.31 MnO which is also noted as a component in other fluorapatites in LCT pegmatites The pegmatite swarm lies at the western end of and is coincident with part of a prominent ~3 km ENE trending eU anomaly interpreted to be a potential fault structure along which additional pegmatites may be developed This and other prominent structures and eU anomalies will be prospected in the 2024 field season Upon seeing positive correlations between eU anomalies and lithium values in alkali feldspars at Church and Kamuck Solstice subsequently staked a strong eU anomaly adjacent to Kamuck to bring its entire area to 43 km 2 Figure 2 Kamuck Property showing eU responses and individual samples on prospected areas identified by aerial imagery Solstice Selected to Received $ 200000 Ontario

    "summary": "If you 're tired of getting stuck in line for the latest sneaker drops or just need an inexpensive generalized set of proxy services MarsProxies is worth checking out Streamlined for the process of shopping online but still plenty capable in most arenas we tested MarsProxies is a service built for sneakerheads by sneakerheads with all the bells and whistles you need to make sure you do n't miss out on that next pair of Air Force Ones It 's among the better proxy services we 've tested overall though the lack of a publicly accessible privacy policy keeps it from earning our Editors Choice award How Much Does MarsProxies Cost MarsProxies follows a standard proxy pricing model including \u00e0 la carte by the gigabyte pricing for residential customers as well as static residential proxies and data center proxies MarsProxies offers five different proxy products These include Obsidian Proxies made for most major shopping destinations Nike Obsidian Proxies proxies specifically designed to work with Nike 's shoe purchase network ISP Proxies high speed low block rate proxies Ultra Residential for daily streaming and geo unblocking and Retail Obsidian specifically designed for Amazon Aldi and several other online retailers I signed up for the Ultra Residential plan which starts at $ 3.75 per GB and can be discounted to just $ 0.75 per gigabyte if you purchase a plan with 500 GB or more This is easily the best per GB pricing I 've seen for a proxy service yet and it undercuts the next cheapest option IPRoyal by half IPRoyal starts at $ 7 per GB and has roughly similar discounts for larger plans Static residential proxies are also available via the Mars ISP Residential Proxies plan which starts at $ 2.50 per proxy for a 30 day license Compare this with IPRoyal which charges $ 2.70 per proxy per month Longer term MarsProxies plans 60 day and 90 day net you discounts depending on the length of your term and the number of IP addresses you purchase If you do a lot of streaming or want to use your proxy strictly to watch geo restricted content the Residential Proxy plan is your best bet While the numbers of available countries and proxy blocks are more limited than with the per GB option trying to stream content on a per gigabyte basis especially at the above prices would quickly put a dent in your wallet MarsProxies does n't offer a free trial for its paid services nor is there a free option If you want to get on the network in any capacity you have to sign up for a paid plan The company accepts payment by all major credit cards but that 's all If you want to pay using alternative options like AllPay or cryptocurrencies you need to default to a different service altogether MarsProxies also caters to data center customers with its Obsidian Data Center plan However the pricing structure for these proxies varies greatly depending on the number you want the country you want the IP addresses to originate from and the features you want attached to your plan The base level pricing starts at $ 1.00 per IP address per day and a 30 day plan starts at $ 1.75 per IP address What Do You Get for Your Money With MarsProxies MarsProxies has a far more extensive collection of features than your standard web proxy including over 186 countries of coverage more than 500000 addresses to select from and additional options like timed auto rotation of your IP and city specific IP address selection If you set up your proxy on your home router you can connect unlimited devices to MarProxies network All its available plans offer the option to connect through the HTTPS protocol or SOCKS5 Head over to our proxy explainer for a primer on what those protocols mean for you and your internet security As a proxy company that is first and foremost geared toward sneakerheads the majority of MarsProxies services and features are set up to work with major sneaker shopping destinations So deep is its devotion to sneaker shoppers that there is an entire plan structure specifically built to work with Nike 's website Buying sneakers online relies on a series of lines and a first come first serve structure MarsProxies IP addresses work to give you the best chance at getting a good position in line either guaranteeing your ability to get the latest shoe drop or at the very least weighting things more heavily in your favor the more IP addresses you sign up for Your Privacy With MarsProxies MarsProxies is based out of Belize I could n't find any publicly available information about the company 's terms and conditions its privacy policy or how it handles data requests from local or international authorities I put in a request with the company 's internal support team via the chat module on the home page and as of this writing I still have n't heard anything back This is a major mark against the service and could be the deciding factor for users despite its strong performance and value proposition If I receive any information back from the company regarding its data privacy practices I 'll update this review accordingly Hands On With MarsProxies I had no trouble configuring the MarsProxies IP address on my test PC and within Firefox though I had to rely on FoxyProxy to get the connection live Unlike IPRoyal MarsProxies does n't offer any of its own browser extensions for customers to use Once I was provided with the proxy address and entered the username and password via the MarsProxies dashboard pictured below I used it to configure my desktop and web traffic to route through the company 's network manually I connected to Denver IP from the closest address to my test machine in Boulder Colorado roughly 20 miles away I used the Firefox browser extension to implement the proxy in our browser though you can also go through this process manually which changes depending on your preferred web browser The Firefox extension allows you to create new proxy profiles for each country you want to connect from and easily copy and paste them from the dashboard into the extension Streaming media is important for consumers but streaming services like Netflix sometimes block or limit access when you use a VPN This is why you may prefer proxy services as their much larger IP address blocks make it easier to quickly cycle through options until you find one that works freely I tried regions I normally include when testing Netflix on VPNs including the US Canada the UK Australia and Japan All were left completely Open on the MarsProxies residential proxy network Sometimes I find VPN services marked as Limited instead as I did with Storm Proxies Check here for our definitions of Open and Limited Whether or not you 'll be able to stream your content at a quality level that 's worth the investment of a proxy is another issue entirely That 's a function of performance and as you 'll see below proxies may not be the best choice MarsProxies Speed and Performance To understand a proxy 's impact on your internet experience I run a series of tests using Google 's speed test tool and find a percent change between test results with and without the proxy running In testing I found that MarsProxies had virtually no effect on upload speeds Download speeds however were more greatly affected by the server hop As you can see above while connected to a local Denver proxy from Boulder CO my test system which is hardwired into a home router reported a download speed reduction of 99.76 Roughly 11 megabits of bandwidth is usable but far from ideal For anyone who wants acceptable speeds while also protecting their originating IP address a VPN might still be a better bet overall given that most of our testing on those products shows drastically less speed reduction than what we see here Remember that network connections are variable so your experience may differ These results are more of a snapshot for comparison than a final verdict on performance We believe that features and overall value are far more important than speed and we discourage you from judging a proxy service solely on these results A Budget Friendly Proxy With Premium Features MarsProxies is one of the better proxies we 've tested With affordable and customizable plans it has something for everyone who needs a proxy service Whether you 're shopping for the latest Nike drops comparing prices on Amazon or pulling SEO reports for your publication platform MarsProxies has both the IP count and the pricing structure to cater to many users Still its opaque privacy practices may rightfully give you pause So while MarsProxies is an excellent service it is n't quite an Editors Choice winner",

    "excerpt": "Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth is a cautionary tale for workaholics reminding us that there 's life outside of our jobs",
    "summary": "Sega On January 4 I received an email I had both been anticipating and dreading for months My copy of Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth one of my most anticipated games of 2024 had dropped into my inbox Usually that moment would give me a jolt of energy I love critiquing games that have real substance and I was still chewing on 2020 's unforgettable Yakuza Like a Dragon several years later That RPG tells a thematically rich story about an unlikely hero finding his confidence amid a quest to take on Japan 's criminal underworld Contents But the desire to dive into the new game would come with one major caveat I needed to give up the next three weeks of my life for it The game 's developer Ryu Ga Gotoku suggested that it would take 80 to 100 hours just to zip through the main story without stopping to enjoy side content The studio 's boss Masayoshi Yokoyama went one step further and claimed that it would make players sick if they tried to binge it all Unfortunately for me I 'd have 19 days if I wanted to have a review out when the January 23 review embargo lifted With no way of knowing how long I 'd be spending in the streets of Honolulu City my anxiety kicked in as I entered the same marathon mindset that Yokoyama had advised against It 's easy to blame this crunch on untenable PR timelines there 's a long history of press not getting enough time with massive RPGs like Baldur 's Gate 3 The reality here though is that my fate was somewhat self imposed I could have spaced out my play time more instead of settling in for long sessions and still finished with time to spare I know that my bosses would n't have cared if we had opted to skip a review entirely as it 's not exactly a mainstream game The only thing compelling me to push myself so hard was me It only took a few days of a lost week for me to reckon with an uncomfortable truth about myself I 'm a workaholic The ultimate irony of that revelation I would n't recognize it until I saw myself in the Dragon of Dojima himself Kazuma Kiryu Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth tells the tale of two heroes whose journeys contrast with one another When the story begins the bright eyed Ichiban Kasuga is living his perfect life Years removed from successfully dissolving two major Yakuza families he 's found his true calling in a dream job at He 's dedicated his life to finding respectable jobs for reformed criminals impacted by the Great Dissolution He 's a perfect employee giving as much of himself to the gig as possible That quickly comes crashing down when his criminal past comes to light and unceremoniously lays him off without a second thought A painful scene sees Kasuga bidding farewell to his beloved co workers on his way out only to be met with lukewarm goodbyes Kasuga may be the most passionate person for the job but it turns out he 's as expendable as anyone else in Kamurocho Sega Real life events make this strong opening perhaps even more timely than developer Ryu Ga Gotoku originally intended Seemingly endless waves of layoffs have rocked tech companies over the past few years The video game industry has been especially impacted with studios big and small laying off thousands of workers in total Games media my own industry has not been spared by the wrath of big business Over the past two years I 've watched countless peers and friends lose their jobs despite delivering top tier work Often these moments would come in the form of scattershot layoffs One day you 'd log online to discover a writer whose work you respect had lost their job Other cases were more dire like The Washington Post sunsetting its video game site Launcher entirely leaving some of the best journalists working today out to dry Whether or not the websites were successful did n't seem to matter when executives needed to find money they were more than ready to loot it out of hardworking employees In this volatile state working within games media feels like being trapped on a beach as the tide slowly rises All you can do is survive as long as possible but it feels inevitable that the ocean will swallow you eventually I 'm no stranger to layoffs I 've seen countless reorgs even before I was working in games full time and I 've been the victim of two layoffs and a contract ending early myself One saw the entire quality assurance department I was part of wiped away right after we were asked to automate our own jobs by coding a website bug testing script Another was a marketing gig at a tumultuous tech startup where a new CEO took the reins from the company 's founder and began routinely stripping talent away In the years leading up to my layoff I watched too many friends pack their boxes some forced out of their jobs by incompetent executives who later lied about the circumstances Experiences like that have a way of putting one in survival mode Writing was n't just a job but a lifeline That 's perhaps how I started to develop bad work habits when I finally broke into games media after over a decade of struggle The climb felt like a Sisyphean task and once I got in I was terrified of watching that boulder roll down the hill again In my early freelance days I was sometimes putting in 12 hours a day as I juggled three part time writing gigs at once In my head it felt like I was on a do or die timeline I needed to establish myself before I was cast out into obscurity again That 's how you end up obsessively playing 60 hours of Like a Dragon in a week That 's the simple explanation at least The more complicated layer is that my full pivot into games media just so happened to come at the tail end of a five year relationship and the start of COVID-19 lockdowns Suddenly locked in a one bedroom apartment alone work provided a convenient way to distract myself from my thoughts The clacking of my mechanical keyboard filled the eerie silence of total isolation Long days felt less lonely when I could convince myself that everything I wrote could be sparking a conversation with someone on the other side of my screen Writing was n't just a job but a lifeline Naturally I saw myself in Ichiban Kasuga Infinite Wealth 's opening is crushing for someone who has lost a job they care about Kasuga a hero who is incapable of insincerity goes above and beyond in his job at In an early sequence he helps a petty thief get on the straight and narrow by using his skills to put local business security systems to the test The reformed criminal is filled with gratitude and it 's clear that Kasuga takes it to heart He 's built his self worth around helping others It all matters So it 's a familiar tragedy when all of that disappears and Kasuga is left directionless after being suddenly thrust into a midlife crisis An ill advised marriage proposal only further dashes his hope for a life outside of that job In the low period that follows Kasuga vows to connect with his loved ones find his long lost family and define his purpose on his own terms rather than someone else 's It 's an inspiring bit of character growth but Kasuga does n't arrive at it by himself Both he and I need to see what we 're in danger of becoming first Enter Kazuma Kiryu When we meet Kiryu the Yakuza 's lovable himbo he drops a bombshell on Kasuga He 's been diagnosed with cancer and only has six months to live It 's an especially shocking reveal in the context of a video game Despite going through mortal danger on a regular basis long running game protagonists rarely kick the bucket When a series becomes popular enough an iconic hero turns into an eternal mascot who is too valuable to lay to rest Maybe Kiryu would fade away when developer Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio decides to stop making Like a Dragon games but in our minds he 'd always be prowling the streets of Japan looking for a fight Infinite Wealth breaks that safety net by putting a very human expiration date on Kiryu 's life Whether it 's by the end of this game or in a sequel Kazuma Kiryu is going to die We as players only have a limited amount of time left with our old friend We also learn that Kiryu is n't helping his case as the Dragon of Dojima is refusing treatment entirely In fact he 's seemingly accelerating his demise when he tells his concerned pals that he intends to keep working to disband the criminal underworld until he croaks He pushes his body to the limits for the first half of the story until it collapses in on itself forcing him to rest up in Japan as he grows weaker Sega While I initially related to Kasuga with his bright eyed optimism and eagerness to do right by his loved ones I 'd soon accept a sadder truth that I had more in common with Kiryu For well over a decade now I 've been operating under the assumption that I will still be working on my deathbed Long term financial planning always felt like a lost cause because I never intended to retire On top of that I 've been brushing off underlying medical worries for years due to my busy work schedule A family history with Factor V Leiden a blood clot condition that can be fatal looms over me as I keep kicking a formal diagnosis down the line I often find myself thinking about Muppet creator Jim Henson and his untimely death in 1990 Henson died of toxic shock syndrome brought on by a case of streptococcus pneumoniae that he refused to get checked out while suffering from fatigue and a sore throat When he began coughing up blood one night in May 1990 he still did n't want to interrupt his work with a hospital visit He finally agreed to go a few hours later but those lost moments would prove critical Going to the hospital a few hours earlier could have saved his life according to New York Hospital ICU director David Gelmont It 's not that I romanticize Henson 's death well perhaps just a little in my younger days It just always felt more like a sad reality I was getting dragged toward No matter how much work I produced I was rarely keeping up with the cost of living And with such instability in the job market it always felt like I needed a bigger cushion to fall back on when the inevitable ax dropped The idea of buying a home is still a pipe dream in my mid-30s and I still ca n't imagine a world where I 'd have both the time and money to raise children I 've often found myself frustrated by the capitalist spiral I 'm stuck in Why do I have to work nonstop in order to live long enough to keep working I ask myself frequently One can read the title Infinite Wealth as a nod to that cycle To survive in today 's world is to be locked in a loop You need to work to make money to live so you can work to make money so on and so on forever Kiryu and Kasuga are even subtle victims of that in the game 's box art where they stand back to back trapped inside a golden infinity sign Midway through playing Infinite Wealth all of this self reflection starts to flood in The irony is n't lost on me I 'm bingeing a game that I 'm assigned to review for work a game that 's begging me to slow down but that is filled with dozens of hours of side content it 's encouraging me to play It 's my own personal infinity loop Despite having a blast with Infinite Wealth itself I start to feel exhausted after a few days One long session leaves me dizzy when I finally decide to take a break I 'm notably irritable by the end of my first week with it becoming unreasonably frustrated over an Amazon shipping snafu My body becomes sensitive from the underlying stress of it all a supportive hug from my girlfriend elicits an instinctive twitch in my shoulders like a bucking bronco protecting itself from outsiders The longer I stare at Kiryu 's face the more I see myself staring back When would I stop writing down ideas on a bucket list and actually start checking them off The last days of my playthrough are n't nearly as long or arduous but that 's perhaps because I 'm spending those days pacing back and forth so much Both Kasuga and Kiryu 's stories resonate with me the more I play inviting me to see two separate sides of myself On one side there 's the overeager busybody who ca n't help but overburden himself because he believes that work defines him The other side is a career loner who just wants to be left alone while he keeps his head down in an endless mission It 's only through working with one another that both men realize that there 's more they want from life whether that be love friendship or forgiveness I 've been working through the same epiphany for the past month While I was visiting family in Massachusetts over Christmas break my mother took me to visit my grandmother It had been at least a year since I 'd seen her last and my mother warned me that a lot had changed in that time She 's 99 years old and living with a case of dementia that 's destroyed her memory Her kids finally moved her into a memory care unit weeks before Christmas after accepting the severity of her condition an inevitability they 'd put off for years I thought I 'd be prepared to see her The last time I did she spoke gibberish for an hour frequently stopping to tell me how nice it is that the prison I was in let me out for a day I was not and have never been incarcerated This visit was entirely different She did n't know who my mother or I were and hardly registered that we were there at all She mostly stared off into the distance occasionally mumbling out a non sequitur I sat with her patiently both glad that she was finally getting the care she needed and quietly terrified My mother 's memory and focus had begun to slip too Judging by family history mine would too someday Sega I was n't directly facing death like Kiryu but I became self aware that there would come a day where I 'd simply run out of time to get everything I want out of this life Though I hope to have some good decades before then time no longer felt infinite as it had for so much of my life I would n't always have these healthy days that I so often take for granted just as I wo n't always have another Like a Dragon adventure starring Kiryu Why spend so much time giving to work that can only give so much back to me When would I stop writing down ideas on a bucket list and actually start checking them off There 's a specific moment where Like a Dragon Infinite Wealth that would push me to make a change setting me down a healthier path In a substory titled Let it Snow Kiryu encounters an eccentric man who is running around Honolulu City buying snow cones and tossing them into the air It 's played for laughs at first but it quickly turns tragic The man 's wife is on her deathbed and he 's determined to let her see a snowfall one last time despite being in Hawaii Kasuga with the help of some adult babies do n't ask is able to simulate a snowy night from the roof of her apartment As flakes drift in through the window the husband breaks down He apologizes for not giving her this moment sooner He 'd spent so much of their lives working not accepting that this day would come eventually She comforts him from her bed telling him that all that matters is that they 're here together now She asks him for one last thing as she begins to fade into her last slumber She 'd just like to see her prince smile one more time before she falls asleep He chokes tears back to deliver that final request as her eyes close and her hand falls limp from his I do n't want to be the man throwing shaved ice into the air I want to watch the real snow fall with my loved ones while we 're still here Editors

to life reshaping our region 's approach to climate resilience Venture Partners at CU Boulder will contribute access to opportunities for startup funding such as Destination Startup and entrepreneurial training Thematically aligned research expertise from across the university such as the Mortenson Center in Global Engineering Resilience and the Earth Lab will drive the creation of new climate innovations The university will also provide performance indicator measurement and economic impact modeling through the Business Research Division of the Leeds School of Business and will develop opportunities to help meet regional workforce development needs The CO WY Engine will build climate resilient communities by combining three of our great strengths at CU Boulder our research into the challenges of climate our track record for translating resulting innovations into real world solutions and our regional partnerships said Bryn Rees associate vice chancellor for research and innovation and managing director of Venture Partners at CU Boulder and one of five co principal investigators of the CO WY Engine As but one example Rees said better wildfire detection could be one outcome of the CO WY Engine If we can detect and respond to a wildfire 20 or 30 minutes earlier it can make a difference in being able to preserve a building and save many lives and maybe also have time to respond early enough to subdue a fire before it gets totally out of control Rees said CU Boulder engineering students survey a home destroyed by the Marshall Fire with structural engineering researcher Erica Fischer middle right from Oregon State University The three are part of a larger team studying the engineering impacts of the fire Photo by Casey Cass CU Boulder Other participating research universities include the Colorado School of Mines Colorado State University the University of Colorado Denver the University of Wyoming UW and the University of Northern Colorado The grant empowers partner universities to engage more deeply in technology transfer and commercialization efforts This involvement is crucial in translating academic research into tangible market ready innovations that address critical environmental and climate challenges facing our region and the world Rees said By doing so the universities will not only contribute to academic knowledge but also play a pivotal role in driving real world impact aligning their research goals with the pressing needs of industry government and communities Moreover the NSF grant aims to elevate the role of universities in workforce development As the region evolves into a leading innovation ecosystem the demand for a skilled workforce conversant with the latest technologies and practices in climate resilience will surge Partner universities are poised to become central to developing this workforce offering specialized programs and training to prepare students and professionals for the emerging job market according to a news release issued by the CO WY Engine This role aligns with the mission of these institutions to educate and empower the next generation of leaders and innovators Together with our partners at other research institutions companies and startup support organizations we will be creating and accelerating technologies and businesses that directly address challenges like wildfire water security and drought Rees said The unprecedented scope and scale of the NSF program which encompasses research innovation and workforce development positions the CO WY Engine to make a real difference across our ecosystem",

    "summary": "CU cinema alum Nick Houy is predicted to be a film editing Oscar nominee for his work on megahit Barbie Nick Houy thought about robbing the Chinese restaurant in Boulder where he worked He never would have done it of course but that 's the joy of storytelling Exploring your most out there ideas asking What if and making all your friends perform the script you wrote It was a heist movie called The Grand and Houy and his friends screened it in the gym for their classmates at New Vista High School one day at lunch They thought nobody would come but everybody came and it was really fun Houy recalls We all ate lunch and watched this movie I 'd shot on S VHS and Super 8 I remember thinking The sound in here is n't great it does n't look great but people seemed to enjoy it anyway The funny thing is he only wrote directed and shot the film so he 'd have something to edit That was what he really loved making sense and stories from hours of footage shaping scatters of stars into constellations Now when the Academy Award nominees for best film editing are announced Tuesday Houy is widely predicted to be one of them for his work editing Barbie For Houy a 2004 University of Colorado Boulder graduate in the Department of Cinema Studies and Moving Image Arts editing Barbie marked his third collaboration with director and screenwriter Greta Gerwig He also edited Lady Bird and Little Women and all were exciting artistic challenges in a career that he has steadily grown from that lunchtime screening of The Grand in his high school gym I think of the editor very much as one of the authors of a movie Houy says like a co writer or co director As an editor you 're also making the movie For me I 've always sought out the best footage I can edit A long time ago I realized that you can do anything with any group of footage and that 's very exciting Bringing images together Houy grew up in Colorado Springs the child of two copy editors so he 's always been familiar with the idea of making an artist 's work as clean as possible His parents also were movie fans and he remembers going to Poor Richard 's a Colorado Springs institution and restaurant bookstore hybrid with a tiny screening room that was the place for New Wave cinema When he was in third grade Houy and his mom moved to Boulder he attended Mapleton Elementary and she worked for CU Boulder with an office in Old Main When he started at New Vista High School he played drums in a punk band with an ever changing name and pursued his passion for photography especially black and white photography He began thinking about how found images and footage could coalesce into a film with the right editing He would rent a camera from community television in the Dairy Arts Center then rent a room there with two tape decks on which he learned to meld photography and his love of watching films through the art of editing I would get Super 8 cameras from yard sales and I remember meeting old men in parking lots who would have a trunk full of Super 8s and I 'd buy them for like $ 20 Houy says I 'd shoot Super 8 film and get it processed at now closed Jones General Store and Camera on the Hill He shot movies of every genre and they were mostly terrible he recalls with a laugh but he was doing it so he could have something to edit The first time I started editing even Super 8 movies I 'd have to splice it and put it together I was just like Yeah this is what I want to do he says Even if you 're doing something like making a video for someone like for a wedding just putting a few shots together and adding music that 's really exciting Then if you just go a little further and say What can I do with found footage So I would just go shoot and would make totally random found footage things which was really fun to do even more than drawing or being in a band or just shooting stills It was just more exciting While he was still in high school Houy took screenwriting and film production classes at CU Boulder and concentrated in film production when he became a student there He remembers rewatching Francois Truffaut 's The 400 Blows in a class taught by Ernesto Acevedo Mu\u00f1oz and feeling profoundly moved by not only the storytelling but by how music and images and every other element of filmmaking can come together into something that resonates and lingers Persistence pays off After graduating Houy moved straight to New York City for the simple reason that he 'd always wanted to live there He had about $ 1000 and crashed on a friend 's couch while he worked at a video store and in his free time went from one post production house to the next leaving his resume and asking whether they 'd give him work doing well anything Finally he got a job moving furniture at Post Works a pre eminent film post production facility where he happened to meet a film colorist who hired him to be an assistant conforming editor In that role he took a low resolution film edit and increased the resolution so it could be color corrected That led to a position on Michael Moore 's film Sicko The film 's colorist Ben Murray was like Do you want to be my assistant conforming editor at night instead of making coffee We would be up all night working on the conform I would sleep under the theater and never go home because I much preferred to be working on a big movie and I really lucked out The Post Factory in those days everyone was working there Michel Gondry was down the hall the Coen brothers Sam Mendes anyone who was cutting in New York in the mid-2000s I saw Spike Lee and Godfrey Reggio when I was in college and I ran into both of them there I said to them Hey I saw you speak at CU Boulder I literally talked to them about them talking at CU Boulder which just shows to students out there go see those people when they talk even if it 's on Zoom because you might run into them He bumped into editor Anne McCabe in a Post Factory hallway when she was working on Adventureland and mentioned how much he loved one of her previous films You Can Count on Me And then I just kind of followed her around saying Please can I be your assistant editor for like a year Houy remembers She hired him to work on Top Five starring Chris Rock which Houy considers one of his biggest breaks Another was his experience working as an apprentice editor on 2008 's The Lucky Ones with editor Naomi Geraghty It was while working on The Lucky Ones that he was told one day that he needed to go pick up a mini fridge from another cutting room and bring it to the cutting room where he was working at the time because his colleagues did n't want to trek to the kitchen constantly While he was grabbing the fridge he met another apprentice editor named Jennifer Lame who edited Oppenheimer and is also considered an Academy Award frontrunner for film editing and they hit it off becoming good friends Lame ended up editing Frances Ha starring Greta Gerwig and directed by Noah Baumbach and she became Baumbach 's editor When Gerwig wrote the script for Lady Bird Lame recommended her friend Nick to edit the film and a creative partnership was born It was while partnering with Gerwig on Little Women that he realized he 'd reached a point in his career of working on Movies with a capital M When we got the first round of dailies the first shot was of a horse and carriage pulling up outside a house and that 's when I was like Oh this is a movie movie Movies that people love watching Barbie saw him ascending to another level of his career it was a comedy which he 'd never really worked with before it had elaborate choreographed dance sequences which he 'd never cut before and had not only an enormous studio budget but even more enormous expectations from fans worldwide We knew we had one thing against us Comedies just do n't do well at the box office these days Houy says That 's the ethos of the industry so we already were worried But I remember reading the script and almost crying Only Greta and Noah can write scripts like that so I knew we had it So then the challenge was just to make sure we did all of that justice these big comedy moments and big emotional moments and huge songs by huge artists Although he could have Houy never visited the Barbie sets in London or Los Angeles preferring instead to feel like I 'm as close to the audience member as I can be at all times he says I want to experience the film like an audience member and an audience member has never walked onto that set I want to be as fresh as possible so I 'm cutting from a place of me as the audience member I want to make a movie that I want to watch The film finished shooting on July 21 2022 and was released July 21 2023 so factoring in that a film must be completed at least a month before its release Houy and his colleagues had just 10 and a half months to complete the movie with visual effects music and everything else It was insane but I 'm very proud of that he says Houy currently is lending editing support on Bob Marley One Love and taking a bit of a breath following the enormous hit that Barbie became Reflecting on it I will always see things I wish we 'd done differently Houy says The old adage is you 're never done you either run out of time or money or both I always want to keep working to make a movie better until we run out of money or time so that when I watch it again I can be really proud of it I just want to make movies that people love watching Top image Warner Bros.

    "summary": "In the lead up to the 2024 presidential race Republican and Democratic voters in Colorado remain deeply divided in how much they trust the integrity of national elections That 's one of the top takeaways from a new survey by researchers at the American Politics Research Lab APRL at CU Boulder and the polling company YouGov The team has published its Colorado Political Climate Survey annually since 2017 an attempt to track how voters in Colorado are navigating hot button issues like election integrity abortion and more In this year 's survey released online Jan. 29 the team reports that 75 of Democrats but only 46 of independents and 41 of Republicans agreed that elections across the country will be conducted fairly and accurately Colorado voters however are much more optimistic about elections in their own state A slim majority or 54 of Republican voters expressed optimism that statewide elections will be fair and accurate That 's troubling said Anand Sokhey director of the APRL and co author of the new survey We 've been seeing that partisan split for a while now and it reflects messaging from Donald Trump and his surrogates questioning the results of the 2020 election To carry out the survey the online survey vendor YouGov gathered responses from 800 Coloradans across the state in December 2023 They included 229 self identified Republicans 263 Democrats and 263 independents with some respondents identifying themselves as other The survey is weighted to reflect the general population of Colorado and has a margin of error of plus or minus 4.23 By the numbers From a CU Boulder and YouGov survey of 800 Colorado voters living across the state in Denver 2023 Job approval ratings President Joe Biden 42 approve 50 disapprove Gov. Jared Polis 49 approve 37 disapprove Sen. John Hickenlooper 43 approve 36 disapprove Sen. Michael Bennet 41 approve 29 disapprove Rep. Lauren Boebert 29 approve 46 disapprove Issues Do you favor or oppose the movement known as Black Lives Matter Favor 50 Oppose 38 Not sure 12 How much do you favor or oppose the federal government making it more difficult for individuals to purchase a gun Favor 56 Oppose 36 Not sure 7 How concerned are you personally about climate change Very concerned or concerned 51 Somewhat concerned 19 Not very concerned or not at all concerned 30 How much do you approve of the Supreme Court 's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade Favor 33 Oppose 51 Not sure 16 The researchers discovered that Colorado seems to be continuing its blue ward shift of the last decade or so In the survey voters favored incumbent President Joe Biden in a hypothetical race against former President Donald Trump by 47 to 40 One thing voters of all affiliations could agree on Colorado is too expensive Nearly 80 of survey respondents reported that they were concerned or very concerned about the cost of living in the state Our goal was to take the pulse of the state as we 're entering this election period Sokhey said In some ways you 'll see a Colorado that reflects the rest of the country but you 'll also see how the state is approaching some issues in a way that 's unique The economy stupid He added that one factor may wind up having an outsized role in shaping the results of the upcoming elections our pocketbooks And voters are leagues apart in how they perceive the economy Nearly two thirds of Republicans and independents rated the state of the nation 's economy as fair or poor according to the survey Only on third of Democrats in contrast expressed similar pessimistic views about the economy Sokhey suspects these divides come down to partisan voters hearing very different messages about the economy from the media they consume You see that consistently Republicans and Democrats are in completely different economic worlds in terms their perceptions he said An eye on Colorado Sokhey noted that in 2022 the U.S. Supreme Court 's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade may have motivated left leaning voters to turn out for that year 's midterm elections Heading into the 2024 elections abortion could continue to be a major force in politics According to the survey 51 of voters in Colorado opposed the court 's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women 's Health while 33 approved of it Notable Sokhey said independents seemed to join Democrats in their disapproval only 24 reported that they approved of overturning Roe v. Wade We 're seeing a lot of data in Colorado and nationally that this could be a vulnerable issue for Republicans he said On the local side survey respondents also weighed on the Taxpayer 's Bill of Rights TABOR Voters approved this amendment to Colorado 's constitution which limits how the state can raise or spend taxpayer dollars in 1992 They seemed to still be in favor today with 54 of respondents expressing their approval Some voters however may be confused by TABOR impacts and by language in other ballot measures Sokhey said Last year voters rejected Proposition HH a measure to rejigger the state 's property taxes by solid margins According to the new survey more than two thirds of voters said they found the language in that proposition confusing We see issues around TABOR pop up every few years and these are complicated and confusing things Sokhey said Indeed people were confused about HH and they assumed that their friends and families were too",

    "summary": "When voters cast their ballots in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections many were driven by their concern for climate change according to new research out of CU Boulder 's Center for Environmental Futures C SEF The new report determined that views on climate change played a significant role in whom people voted for concluding that the climate issue very likely cost Republicans the 2020 election all else equal This is obviously information that politicians and advocates across the political spectrum will want to know heading into the 2024 election cycle said Matthew Burgess CIRES Fellow and C SEF director How to reduce political polarization of climate change is one of the questions our research group is most interested in currently and this provides some insight In their new assessment published today Burgess and his co authors two C SEF graduate students and researchers from Vanderbilt University and the University of California Santa Barbara sought to understand the importance of climate change as a voter issue in the two most recent presidential elections The team used data from the nonpartisan Voter Study Group to analyze how issue opinions and demographics affected the 2016 and 2020 elections The research team used several techniques to assess how climate change opinion shaped voters choices logistic regression a machine learning model and a simulation of the Electoral College in which they could turn the role of climate change on or off Their conclusion Republicans could have gained at least a 3 percent swing in the popular vote which almost certainly would have been enough to have taken the White House in 2020 The team found personal views on climate change were one of the strongest predictors of voting behavior in 2020 especially among independents Not surprisingly they found the majority of Democrats and independents are worried about climate change And many younger and moderate Republicans also see climate change as an important issue one quarter of Republicans who think climate change is very important voted for President Biden in 2020 Such widespread concern about climate change is currently a clear upper hand for the Democratic party The party holds a 26 point advantage over Republicans on the issue a lead larger than any other opposing topic between the two parties in a recent poll Voters from a broad range of political persuasions seem to see Democrats as more capable of finding solutions and instating policies to address problems created by climate change even if not every Democratic climate change policy is necessarily popular While the issue of climate change strongly predicts whom people voted for in 2020 overall it is not the number one concern among voters Less than 5 percent of adults rank climate change as the single most important issue More pressing issues include those that affect people 's daily lives like the economy healthcare education and crime If climate change is n't voters top issue why is it such a strong predictor One reason might be that most people see the evidence for climate change as so strong that if a candidate were to deny or minimize that issue they might trust that candidate less on other issues Burgess said Another reason might be that voters are beginning to see a connection between climate change and the kitchen table issues they care about more like the economy security and health But we ca n't say for sure and this is a key question for future research As the country prepares for the next election the odds are good that climate change will influence whom they vote for",

    "excerpt": "Sidney D'Mello is a professor in CU Boulder 's Institute of Cognitive Science and Department of Computer Science and is also director of the National Science Foundation AI Institute for Student AI Teaming",
    "summary": "Sidney D'Mello is a professor in CU Boulder 's Institute of Cognitive Science and Department of Computer Science He is also director of the National Science Foundation AI Institute for Student AI Teaming which aims to develop artificial intelligence AI technologies to facilitate social and collaborative learning experiences for all students Can you talk about your research with AI and education There are five flagship NSF research institutes that focus on supporting learning with AI and we were the first one Schools right now have n't changed in a hundred years they 're focused on efficiency as an outcome The use of AI in education has been to keep that vision of efficiency going where students individually work with computer programs powered by AI The vision I want for classrooms is a place where students are working together being loud and it 's a noisy rambunctious environment where they 're challenging ideas and they 're building social relationships This vision is centered around a different perspective of learning which is that learning is authentic to students interests and identities and so on A key question we ask is how best to integrate AI within that vision How could your vision be implemented This is a vision that 's been articulated forever in the learning sciences but it is difficult for teachers to implement because they ca n't be listening in on several student groups at once Some conversations may go off track or perhaps some conversations are amazing but the teacher is unaware of the discussion happening So the question is how can AI help support this Our idea is thinking of AI as this social collaborative partner immersed in these small groups to help them along The AI is actually interacting with small groups listening in on the conversations analyzing nonverbal behaviors like pointing and then figuring out how to facilitate those small group conversations but always by coordinating with the teacher The teacher remains the centerpiece here The AI is providing decision support around the teacher to help them orchestrate their classroom as they see best How are students responding to your research We know that with AI comes great responsibility We did n't want to build anything without first working with the students themselves We know that with AI comes great responsibility We did n't want to build anything without first working with the students themselves We organized workshops with them to be transparent acquire their trust and have their voices heard However we soon realized that it was challenging for youth to imagine what good collaboration could look like beyond what they had experienced in school So we took a group of students to this cooperative house in Berkeley Colorado where they learned how house members had to live together and collaborate outside of schooling They were introduced to the idea of community agreements which are mutually agreed upon norms of behavior that the house members themselves co negotiate and use to hold each other account able The youth wondered if an AI could help them to generate and maintain such agreements and developed a design sketch to embody their ideas What happened as a result This led to one of our AI technologies called the Community Builder CoBi With the help of the teacher students work in small groups to input their examples of agreements into the CoBi interface As students engage in collaborative learning CoBi analyzes student discourse for evidence or noticings of these agreement categories The results are visualized by way of a growing tree animation that everyone can see where the noticings are shown as flowers that bloom Teachers and students use these visualizations to reflect and make sense about their adherence to their agreements Now this is where privacy becomes really important By working with students and getting their sense of comfort we learned they are terrified of any of their individual talk being known to the teacher So we do not give the teacher any information on who 's speaking and saying what We do n't even say which student group It 's all aggregated in this class level interface which is the tree Are students interacting with the AI interface We actually show them what the CoBi is doing and then the idea is they can correct it if they see something off with its predictions That gives us good dataand the students can help it improve itself But more importantly they can have a conversation about why it 's doing what it 's doing Because remember we also want to teach youth how to learn and collaborate And so they can have a conversation like Hey CoBi we thought this was an example of being respectful but you missed it What concerns do you have about ChatGPT right now I do n't think we should ban these tools as that never works But there 's a lot of stuff that still needs to be addressed with these AI programs still For example when I 'm talking I 'm gesturing and pointing So I 'm making meaning in that context ChatGPT and all of those other programs are good for their language piece but they are not grounded in the real world That 's why we are working with foundational AI to integrate semantics of speech with gesture gaze and social cues to make an understanding from multimodal multi party discourse How can teachers quickly be trained in AI Right now a phrase that 's used a lot is responsible AI You can get teachers caught up in AI and we 're developing curricula for AI literacy for this very purpose But it 's really a more foundational thing how can we change learning How do you design a curriculum that does 21st century skills collaboration critical thinking inquiry disciplinary knowledge experimentation investigation and developing character at the same time You 've talked a lot about ethical and equitable AI What does that mean Right now a phrase that 's used a lot is responsible AI It 's not asking what AI can do it 's asking what I should do basically We have a framework of responsible innovation that we implement in everything we do from the start and it begins with ourselves our values our processes and our commitment to our students and teachers",

    "summary": "Are you wondering how to rebuild a car engine make lasagna apply eyeliner or build a castle in Minecraft Millions of Americans get their answers from influencers on social media And now a growing crowd of finfluencers a portmanteau of the phrase financial influencers are vying to become your investing gurus Search investing or a related term on Instagram TikTok YouTube or any other major social media platform and you 'll get thousands of posts from a dizzying array of creators You 'll see videos of investors flaunting wads of cash driving Lamborghinis or flashing

dance celebrations There are posts from finance professionals and amateur investors twentysomethings and sixtysomethings and members of all types of affinity groups And of course you 'll also find posts from media outlets like Kiplinger The most popular investing social media mavens have amassed millions of followers and are earning millions of dollars from advertisements sponsorships book sales and membership and consulting fees Many are succeeding for good reason They provide sound advice in entertaining ways For Denise Berkhalter a 51 year old single mother of two who works at a nonprofit the fun high energy videos by former Wall Street trader Vivian Tu whose Your Rich BFF TikTok account has 2.5 million followers provided encouragement for her to maximize her employer 's retirement plan match and maintain both a regular and a Roth IRA Berkhalter plows much of the money into the kinds of broad index funds that Tu recommends She 's hilarious says Berkhalter She 's relatable She takes the time to break things down into understandable bite sizes And she 's willing to talk about her own mistakes which is helpful because you realize you do n't have to be perfect Former Wall Street trader Vivian Tu 's TikTok account Your Rich BFF has 2.5 M followers But some influencers promote strategies that are inappropriate for many if not most investors Worse Social media platforms are also rife with scamsters Federal regulations require influencers to clearly label any posts for which they are being paid and bar misleading statements or frauds such as pump and dump schemes in which influencers secretly sell shares in stocks they are hyping to their followers And the government has pursued some high profile influencers The Securities and Exchange Commission SEC has extracted millions of dollars collectively from celebrities including Kim Kardashian and Lindsay Lohan to settle charges that they improperly failed to disclose they were being paid to promote cryptocurrencies on their social media feeds on Instagram and Twitter now known as X The SEC has also charged several popular finfluencers with running pump and dump schemes And undoubtedly a lot escapes scrutiny So many people are now making investment related content that it is literally not possible for budget constrained federal regulators to monitor and police all of it on all social media platforms says Ankush Khardori a former federal prosecutor who specialized in financial crimes Even if you do n't take investing advice from social media stars you should be aware of the landscape because the odds are that your friends and relatives do A study by Finra the self regulatory organization for brokers found that 60 of investors younger than 35 get investing information from social media Videos with the hashtag investing have garnered an astonishing 16 billion views on TikTok since its 2016 launch for example What 's more social media investing frenzies can significantly impact the values of stocks in your portfolio recall the mayhem in GameStop and other meme stocks engineered by Reddit users in 2021 To help you navigate this new frontier for financial advice we dived into the world of finfluencers starting with FinCon 2023 the annual confab for personal finance content creators It 's a vast universe But here we highlight some of the better known social media accounts along with a few not so famous selections We 've included a breakdown of finfluencers financial incentives that can help you suss out any potential hidden agendas or biases We 've also assembled a list of red flags from experts to help you stay safe online The evolution of finfluence The Oxford English Dictionary defines an influencer as a person who has become well known through use of the internet and social media and uses celebrity to endorse products often for payment The word finfluencer may be a new coinage but it just describes the latest evolution of long standing marketing and outreach efforts by financial advisers and personal finance media professionals After all Vanguard founder Jack Bogle amplified his index fund investing message by publishing books Ric Edelman attracted clients to his financial planning firm by hosting a finance focused radio show Jim Cramer left his hedge fund to host the Mad Money television show and encourage viewers to buy his investing books and pay the membership fee for his investing club It 's not surprising that many professional financial advisers are trying to use social media to recruit new clients A few have developed large fan bases Brad Klontz a Hawaii based certified financial planner and author of books on the psychology of money has nearly 1 million TikTok followers Among his most popular videos is one showing him wearing a baseball cap and sunglasses walking the streets of Boulder Colorado and talking into a microphone about how you 'll be poor forever if you do these three things one of which is day trading Other social media gurus who still call investment advising their day job include Brian Preston and Bo Hanson certified financial planners at Abound Wealth Management in Franklin Tennessee They host The Money Guy Show which has amassed more than 78 million views cumulatively in its 12 years on YouTube The episodes generally run from 15 minutes to an hour and feature the two sitting at desks taking calls conducting interviews and discussing topics such as allocations to international stocks as well as broader personal finance issues such as the outlook for real estate and reactions to Dave Ramsey 's advice Jennifer Lammer a registered investment adviser in Scarsdale New York posts 10- to 20 minute detailed looks at fixed income investments such as bonds and CDs in her Diamond NestEgg YouTube channel launched in mid-2020 Her posts such as The 8 safest banks have collectively received more than 12 million views The largest group of finfluencers today is made up of personalities who offer broad personal finance advice Investing typically makes up only a fraction of their offerings and tends to be aimed at beginners Some of the most popular of these are former finance professionals Vivian Tu who posts as Your Rich BFF spent two years as a trader at J.P. Morgan before starting to post short financial advice videos on TikTok during the COVID lockdowns Her goal she says is to make finance fun ance In a recent post that has nearly 2 million views she explains how regular investors can copy a tax move used by pop star Drake to seed his kid 's Roth IRA Drake hired his son to produce album art then funneled his earnings into a custodial Roth IRA for the child Tu suggested noncelebrity parents can hire their kids to work in a family business and use that income to invest in a custodial Roth IRA where it can grow tax free Or they could invest earnings from say babysitting cutting grass or other odd jobs Tu recommends S&P 500 index funds Humphrey Yang who spent a year as a financial adviser at Merrill Lynch has 3.3 million TikTok followers and 1.2 million YouTube subscribers who eat up his short videos on everything from the economics of buying an electric bike to the impossibility of timing the stock market In one he examines what he considers the four worst investments low paying savings accounts whole life insurance mutual funds that charge sales fees and triple leveraged exchange traded funds which are funds that borrow against their holdings so their prices move three times as much as the index they track YouTube says that collectively Yang 's 571 videos have been viewed more than 271 million times Marko Zlatic studied finance in college and worked as a car salesman and then as a credit analyst at a bank In late 2017 he started posting YouTube videos in which he explained a specific aspect of personal finance by writing on a whiteboard with a marker while throwing in a few jokes to keep things light Some of his early videos such as one on How car dealers rip you off went viral By 2019 Zlatic 's WhiteBoard Finance channel was earning enough that he could quit his job His library includes investing oriented posts such as one explaining how he built a SEP IRA with some input from viewers He calculates the IRA invested in low cost ETFs from Vanguard and others will pay an income of $ 1000 a month in retirement Zlatic 's library of about 300 videos has collected more than 61 million views Some of the most popular finfluencers come from outside the financial world Many say they were motivated to start posting because they overcame financial struggles themselves and wanted to share hope and strategies with those facing similar challenges Andrei Jikh 's parents were Cirque du Soleil acrobats who struggled with debt Jikh started his career as a magician but also studied investing on his own He built a $ 200000 nest egg and in 2019 he started posting videos about what he learned spicing some of them up with magic tricks Along with bullish posts about cryptocurrencies Jikh shares his dividend investing strategy which focuses on index funds and Dividend Aristocrats such as Realty Income Aristocrats are stocks with at least a 25 year history of raising dividends Realty Income is a member of the Kiplinger Dividend 15 the list of our favorite dividend payers Jikh 's videos have more than 283 million views Another major group of finfluencers consists of analysts using the new media platforms to launch what are essentially modern investing newsletters Robert Ross was a stock analyst for the newsletter firm Mauldin Economics in 2019 when he started experimenting with short investing videos on what was then a relatively new social media platform TikTok The niche was so new that he was able to snag one of the cleverest user names Tik.stocks Many of his stock analysis videos and meme laced takes on hedge funds holdings went viral A skit warning against buying stock with margin loans has garnered more than 2 million views Within 15 months Ross was earning enough from sponsorships and subscriptions to quit his job He still delivers some tips on his free account But today nearly 800 of his followers are paying at least $ 19.99 a month to see Ross personal portfolio and investments grossing him about $ 14000 monthly This is the next natural iteration of an industry that has been around for 100 years the newsletter It 's just a video version he says The ease of posting online has enabled self taught analysts to reach large audiences as well In late 2020 Alex Divinsky who majored in electrical engineering and worked as a rocket analyst and media strategist started posting his analyses of tech stocks on his YouTube channel Ticker Symbol YOU His first 11 videos got only a few hundred views each His 12th got more than 40000 and put Divinsky on many investors radar In it he explained why he thought Tesla 's autonomous driving software trained on billions of miles worth of driving data from its cars would eventually translate into massive profit for the company After eight months of weekly posts Divinsky 's channel became so popular he was on track to earn a six figure annual income from ads and sponsorships His 10- to 30 minute posts typically explore a company held by one of the tech oriented funds managed by ARK Investments In a recent post Divinsky spliced in slides video clips and documents from company presentations and other sources to explain why he thinks Nvidia will continue to dominate the market for chips used in the booming artificial intelligence sector Overall Divinsky has amassed more than 27 million views Vivian Tu Your Rich BFF Image credit Taylor Hill Getty Images Low barriers to entry can lead to scams The low barriers to entry have also been exploited by scamsters plying some of Wall Street 's oldest scams For example a group of day traders associated with a company called Atlas Trading each built up six figure fan bases on platforms such as Twitter YouTube and the gaming chat platform Discord by claiming expertise in penny stocks which are the stocks of small companies with share prices below $ 5 The traders who often posted pictures of their Lamborghinis and luxury watches told their followers they were sharing their insights for free to help millions of traders But the SEC says it has recordings of group members conspiring to hype certain stocks so that they can quietly sell at a profit The SEC alleges the group made more than $ 100 million from 2020 through their 2022 indictment by pumping and dumping In one recording cited by the SEC Daniel Knight a cohost of a popular penny stock podcast who had 171000 Twitter followers under the handle @DipDeity allegedly said We 're robbing f***ing idiots of their money It 's market manipulation Knight pleaded guilty to securities fraud in March 2023 His co defendants are scheduled for trial in early 2024 Finfluencers find their niche Many finfluencers tailor personal finance and investing advice to specific groups Several aim their advice at women for example Tori Dunlap 's her first 100k TikTok account features short videos encouraging women to improve their earnings and wealth or as she puts it Fight the patriarchy Get rich Dunlap has amassed 2.4 million followers since 2020 Her podcast Financial Feminist features interviews and discussions ofinvesting basics as well as topics such as negotiating like a woman and overcoming financial anxiety It is one of the 20 most popular business related podcasts in the U.S. according to Chartable a company that tracks the podcasting industry Haley Sacks whose mrs dow jones Instagram account has more than 831000 followers mixes travel and shopping tips with explanations of Roth IRAs and otherinvesting basics Hundreds of influencers focus on other communities Yanely Espinal the daughter of Hispanic immigrants started posting YouTube videos as MissBeHelpful after being inspired by a Suze Orman book to cut her expenses to free up cash from her educator 's salary to pay off $ 20000 in credit card debt and build her savings Espinal appreciated Orman 's discussion of finances for women but could n't find anyone addressing many of the issues faced in her community For example she said No one was talking about remittances sending money to family in other countries as part of the budget Espinal 's videos have more than 4.4 million views and last May she published a book entitled Mind Your Money It includes a chapter about investing challenges faced by immigrants and people of color such as language barriers that can make financial dealings more confusing When your life has been transformed you do n't want to hold it in You feel a calling to help other people transform their lives she says Julien and Kiersten Saunders post videos and slides on Instagram where their richandregular account has almost 34000 followers they also have a couple of podcasts The couple tailor advice for achieving financial independence to African- Americans and they tackle thorny issues such as racism and wage gaps They like to share their own story of paying off $ 200000 in debt over five years and then saving enough to quit their corporate jobs by the time the",

    "excerpt": "New Age war being waged for soul of Big Sur 's Esalen",
    "summary": "BIG SUR The world famous Esalen Institute has n't seen this much controversy since a psychic was hired in 1979 to contact extraterrestrials for advice on reorganizing management Now as Esalen marks its 50th anniversary veterans of the New Age retreat center best known for massages self awareness and naked hot tubbing say a new crisis has emerged a corporate philosophy bent on making money and turning the institute into a boutique style spa Esalen now emulates the worst of corporate America one employee posted on esaleaks.org a website modeled on WikiLeaks that gives voice to the Esalen community of workers and workshop leaders that is suddenly feeling more fear and intimidation than peace and love We 've lost sight of what this place was founded for said Bill Herr who has been connected with Esalen for two decades and is now the director of its art center The controversy comes at a time when the institute is striving to maintain its identity relevance and bottom line long after its pioneering achievements have gone mainstream yoga classes at the YMCA massages at the mall organic food at Walmart Tensions reached a boiling point last month when three beloved midlevel managers were abruptly laid off as part of a restructuring The widow of one of the two co founders as well as an Esalen board member resigned in protest A son of one founder and a nephew of another worry about Esalen 's legacy And every day at 1 p.m. a defiant group sometimes as many as 70 people gather in a silent circle of honor to mourn the loss of the laid off co workers It 's been a bloodbath in ways as the old school has met the new said David Schiffman 69 who has led vision quests and workshops at Esalen for 43 years He recently decided to stop singing and drumming at the spirit calling and purification ceremonies on a deck overlooking the Pacific Ocean I did n't want to be fiddling while Rome burned Schiffman said I could n't imagine playing music in a place where people were having the music squeezed out of them Founded by Michael Murphy and Dick Price in 1962 Esalen quickly became a symbol of California 's hippie counterculture attracting the music and pop psychology icons of the day from Bob Dylan and Joan Baez to Timothy Leary Fritz Perls and Abraham Maslow whose hierarchy of needs became required college reading In the 1970s Murphy 's Golf in the Kingdom became a best seller And in the 80s Esalen became known for hot tub diplomacy when it tried to play a role in easing Cold War tensions by hosting Soviet diplomats including then Moscow Mayor Boris Yeltsin on tours of America and meetings with their U.S. counterparts In its day Esalen was the TED Talks and Burning Man all rolled into one said David Price general manager from 1995 to 2003 and son of co founder Dick Price who died when he was crushed by a Big Sur boulder in 1985 I just do n't see it as having that level of impact right now To me it 's a shame And while the current strife looks like a management vs. labor kind of dispute said the art center 's Herr what 's really going on is a kind of cultural assault But Esalen President Gordon Wheeler and board member Bill James say Esalen remains a vibrant place where for the past eight years many of those recessionary years it has welcomed record numbers of guests to sex and marriage sessions organic farming seminars human potential workshops and leadership conferences Still Wheeler said it is true we have to have more emphasis on accountability and job effectiveness than we used to We 're a nonprofit We do need to break even The pressures for that are greater than they used to be for sure The controversy has been made all the more painful and intense he said by the isolation of the institute 45 miles down the rocky coastline from Monterey and the fact that about 100 employees live on the property and feel as close as family Many participate in the work study program living on the property doing housekeeping or working in the garden and kitchen as well as joining groups of stocking feet workshop guests in meditation and other self help seminars The recent changes have been especially difficult for those who go back decades Like most companies James said Esalen employees now must log their hours and explain overtime which to old timers smacks of not being trusted And after a recent incident in which a busy exasperated kitchen employee refused to make a birthday cake for a guest James said employees were encouraged to smile and nod at guests as they pass them along the dirt pathways You would have thought we ordered them to wear a uniform James said Something like this is a revolution to them The nonprofit corporation that owns Esalen has healthy reserves and is embarking on an ambitious long term plan to renovate nearly every yurt cottage and barn on the property But Esalen officials say they have no intention of turning the place into a luxury resort like Post Ranch and Ventana just up Highway 1 To become a high end spa would be too dull for us Wheeler said We 'd like to serve our guests a little better But that 's it While Esalen may have a five star view recent upgrades to some guest units raised them closer to Holiday Inn status James said He and Wheeler say they want to keep the institute focused on the cutting edge of thought on personal and social transformations and helping mold leaders through conscious business seminars Earlier this month executives from Whole Foods Trader Joe 's Nordstrom and IDEO gathered for one of them The irony is n't lost on Esalen managers who know they sometimes appear to have missed some of their own workshops Enlightened Leadership in Challenging Times for instance We 're trying to do the best we can and we do n't always get it right Wheeler said Could we have handled it better I think we could have yes The institute has certainly gone through tough times before In 1998 El Ni\u00f1o storms destroyed the legendary open air mineral baths fed by hot springs jetting out of the cliffs Cost overruns to rebuild the bathhouse and tubs plunged the institute deeply into debt and forced managers to rethink operations More people with more business backgrounds and fewer with psychology credentials were invited to join the board And conflicts with staff became more common as more basic business practices were implemented The Esaleaks website was created a year before the recent layoffs as an anonymous forum for employees to air their gripes Posted documents from staff salaries to tax returns have been uploaded to the site On the website the writers sardonically refer to themselves as The Nine a reference to the so called nine extraterrestrials from the star Sirius that British psychic Jenny O'Connor said she channeled to help her decide how to shake up management in the late 1970s At the time some in the community referred to The Nine as extraterrestrial hatchet men O'Connor was hired by Dick Price I think he may have used her to enact things he wanted to do anyway said his son David who lives in Poland but returns to Esalen every year There was a level of absurdity to the whole thing The current management crisis however seems to cut deeper Several recent meetings and letters back and forth have so far failed to ease the tensions The realities that sober you up that make you feel the weight of things the responsibility to be serious not dreamy or childish have come home to roost Schiffman said The struggle has been to keep the soul of Esalen intact Contact Julia

    "summary": "As he walks around his Oakland office near I-880 environmental advocate Brian Beveridge sees obvious issues diesel exhaust and piles of trash But he has deeper concerns literally Beveridge co founder of West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project is worried about solvents and other chemicals in the soil a legacy of spills from polluting industries that long operated in West Oakland If a severe storm rolls in bringing surging seas and heavy rain the dormant contamination could be brought back to the surface drowning the area in a toxic stew We operate with a kind of false sense of security because we 've been living in a drought for 15 years Beveridge said Within three months we could have a flooded neighborhood emergency crews trying to clear out storm drains toxic water going into the bay Patrick Barnard explains in Jan. 2020 how the Coastal Storm Modeling System CoSMoS integrates information from the Hazard Exposure and Reporting Analytics HERA mapper to understand the social and economic consequences of different flooding scenarios Courtesy of USGS/ Coastal Storm Modeling System That threat will worsen with a rise in the sea level driven by climate change On a glossy map propped up against the whiteboard in his office Beveridge points at West Oakland and Alameda and imagines both inundated with water The threat of sea level rise is one of the hazards tracked by the Coastal Storm Modeling System CoSMoS which predicts the myriad effects that coastal storms and shoreline change could bring The modeling system developed by a team led by Patrick Barnard and Li Erikson of the U.S. Geological Survey 's Pacific Coastal and Marine Center in Santa Cruz combines data from weather services measurements from monitored sites and detailed data on the shape of the coast and seabed It also factors in the effects of future sea level rise and increasing storm intensity to show how those will increase with climate change The information provides a crucial resource for environmental advocates and city officials planning for the effects of climate change Officials in San Mateo County for instance turn to the modeling system before purchasing any land parcels ensuring that they understand risks posed by rising groundwater erosion and coastal flooding These tools are really really important for us said Isabel Pares Ramos the county 's senior sustainability specialist In the office of Andy O'Neill an oceanographer and storm modeler the desk space is taken up by widescreen monitors that she clicks between as she talks Displayed across them are lines of computer code a presentation on the modeling system and maps zoomed in on various Bay Area cities A blue sphere floats in the corner of a presentation showing wind and water movement for the globe You ca n't go straight from global changes to local impacts without a couple steps said O'Neill as she explained how CoSMoS incorporates data from global climate models into local predictions of storm impacts Knowing where storms will hit hardest is useful but planners also need to understand what that means for residents and infrastructure Just showing hazard maps does n't really mean a lot to people but when there are dollars and lives that are tied in that opens up the discussion with governments said Barnard of USGS which also developed the Hazard Exposure Reporting Analytics tool to show the human and economic effects of storm impact projections Nate Wood one of its developers provided a demonstration on a Zoom call from his office in Portland Oregon With a mouse click projected sea levels that incorporate data on storm surges climbed up to 10 feet bathing cities in the Bay Area in azure Further clicks set the map awash with new blocks of color showing how many residents homes employees and buildings might end up underwater given potential storm surges and predicted sea level rise It 's setting the scene for more relevant conversations about what people truly value Wood said And if my data can be part of that conversation then I 've done my job One of the major Bay Area assets that 's already being affected by coastal storms is the San Francisco Oceanside Water Pollution Control Plant The El Ni\u00f1o winter of 2009 and 2010 brought storms that caused severe erosion and destroyed parts of the Great Highway which separates the southern end of Ocean Beach from the plant The city took drastic measures protecting the plant with a 425 foot long embankment of boulders known as riprap If the plant were to fail it would cause sewage to spill straight into the sea destroying coastal water quality But in 2011 the California Coastal Commission denied permits to add additional armoring The wastewater treatment plant is in the way of where the coast wants to be said Dan Hoover also with the USGS in Santa Cruz So there 's really no way you can protect it in the long term For many people living in parts of the Bay Area most threatened by sea level rise and storm surges moving is n't an option given the costs of relocation Our council strategy so far has been very clear to us that we should be doing everything possible to protect the coastal shoreline to protect those communities and to keep people rooted within the community said Daniel Hamilton sustainability and resilience director for the city of Oakland The road is closed on 7th Street at Frontage Road after flooding in West Oakland Calif. on Thursday Feb. 14 2019 Jane Tyska Bay Area Group In West Oakland communities asked for a central location to gather during emergencies This year Oakland partnered with the West Oakland Environmental Indicators Project and other grassroots organizations to fund a resilience hub at 18th and Adeline streets This includes the DeFremery Recreation Center the West Oakland Senior Center and West Oakland Branch Library If flooding were to occur residents would be able to access resources such as food and electricity to charge their devices Oakland is also protecting its waterfront by putting down riprap mixed with eelgrass and native plants to create floodable zones that could prevent water from reaching neighborhoods such as West Oakland Working out how best to protect local communities from the ravages of storms and sea level rise depends crucially on tools developed by the USGS and local research organizations including the San Francisco Estuary Institute Hamilton said Cities do n't have the ability to do that science independently he said",

    "summary": "Do n't bother searching for the root cause of Arizona 's come from ahead loss at Oregon State The Hotline solved the riddle The same answer applies to Arizona 's loss at Washington State two weeks ago and Arizona 's loss at Stanford two weeks before that Winning on the road is hard folks At the midpoint of the Pac-12 season road teams have a 16 40 record in conference play a winning percentage of just 28.6 Each game follows a different course Perhaps poor shooting by the visitors is the cause Or officiating that leans toward the home team Or a singular performance akin to what we saw last week in Corvallis from OSU guard Jordan Pope It all adds up to the same conclusion And in the Pac-12 winning on the road this season is substantially more difficult than in recent years We avoided pre COVID data and we skipped the 2020 21 season because of the obvious disruption caused by the pandemic But it 's worth noting that road teams won 42.5 percent of conference games raw record 51 69 during the 2021 22 season a high level of success perhaps attributable to the lingering impact of COVID on attendance Home games carried a neutral court vibe The numbers dropped in the 2022 23 season which was normal in every regard Road teams were just 44 76 a winning percentage of 36.7 If the current pace 28.6 percent holds through the final five weeks of conference play the visitors will finish this season with a 34 86 record And that pace could be worse Five of the 16 road wins thus far have come by three points or less Had a few bounces gone for the hosts instead of the visitors the win rate for road teams would be on the low side of 25 percent We could get there by March As the grind of the season takes hold and legs become heavy energy from the home crowd will

    "summary": "Donald Trump has always believed that his MAGA base is enough to get him elected He proved repeatedly in every election after 2016 that it is not only not enough to elect him but it 's also not enough to elect any other MAGA Republican So it was particularly dumb of Trump to post on his social media platform that no Haley donors will ever be welcome within the MAGA camp He 'll need those people maybe not for their money but at least for their votes Politics is a game of addition yet Trump seems only to know division Nikki Haley used Trump 's dumb message as a fundraising vehicle and it worked news reports say she raised $ 1 million since the Trump threat As if that were n't enough of an unforced error early on Thursday news was making the rounds that the Republican National Committee would consider a resolution brought forward by Trump lackey David Bossie that would have the RNC designate Donald Trump as the party 's presumptive nominee How about that for an insane proposal by a party that many Americans already see as anti Democratic The proposal per the AP states that the RNC declares President Trump as our presumptive 2024 nominee for the office of President of the United States and from this moment forward moves into full general election mode welcoming supporters of all candidates as valued members of Team Trump 2024 Riiight we will assume that supporters of all the people who ran against Trump are now part of Team Trump Unbelievable There is precisely 0 chance that this was pushed by Bossie without Trump 's knowledge but the backlash must have been severe because a few hours later Trump came out against the proposal Trump says he opposes RNC proposal to name him the party 's presumptive nominee msn.com On Fox Business on Thursday CO

State two weeks ago and Arizona 's loss at Stanford two weeks before that Winning on the road is hard folks At the midpoint of the Pac-12 season road teams have a 16 40 record in conference play a winning percentage of just 28.6 Each game follows a different course Perhaps poor shooting by the visitors is the cause Or officiating that leans toward the home team Or a singular performance akin to what we saw last week in Corvallis from OSU guard Jordan Pope It all adds up to the same conclusion And in the Pac-12 winning on the road this season is substantially more difficult than in recent years We avoided pre COVID data and we skipped the 2020 21 season because of the obvious disruption caused by the pandemic But it 's worth noting that road teams won 42.5 percent of conference games raw record 51 69 during the 2021 22 season a high level of success perhaps attributable to the lingering impact of COVID on attendance Home games carried a neutral court vibe The numbers dropped in the 2022 23 season which was normal in every regard Road teams were just 44 76 a winning percentage of 36.7 If the current pace 28.6 holds through the final five weeks of conference play the visitors will finish this season with a 34 86 record And that pace could be worse Five of the 16 road wins thus far have come by three points or less Had a few bounces gone for the hosts instead of the visitors the win rate for road teams would be on the low side of 25 percent We could get there by March As the grind of the season takes hold and legs become heavy energy from the home crowd will

The Garden was successful in its bid to produce the series and was handed the keys alongside The Traitors maker Studio Lambert While there were certainly teething problems the pair have come in for praise for bringing their particular expertise to the smash show The Garden with its fixed rig specialism and Studio Lambert with edge of the seat constructed reality Hay however said The Garden 's contribution was broader than fixed rig and spotlighted its work making shows about people who find themselves up against the ropes I expect half of the producers in the world were talking to Netflix about adapting Squid Game he added There was a sense of creative cross pollination about what might spark creatively if you put people coming from different directions into the same conversation We have plenty of experience with shows about characters under pressure whether that 's having a major accident or being in a police interview room or trying to scratch a shape from a cookie Hay said The Challenge was like nothing else I have ever done and even Steven Lambert boss of Studio Lambert said that halfway through While the model of two production companies working together is more common in the U.S. Hay suggested that the UK industry will see more collaborations in the vein of The Garden and Studio Lambert He backed Lambert 's recent proclamation that the success of shows like The Challenge could lead buyers to opt for premium unscripted over drama My sense is unscripted shows at scale are delivering big audiences he added People keep buying what works so there will be appetite for it Brown who was on set in Hertfordshire for weeks revealed she gave birth just four hours after the cameras were turned off I was thinking to myself just get to the end of the shoot she said While UK TV is in a tough moment with a commissioning slowdown that has hit Hay 's former employer Channel 4 particularly hard Hay said the potential opportunities out there are exciting and having both terrestrial buyers and streamers in full play gifts different kinds of opportunity as he contrasted the size and scale of The Challenge with a highly rated episode of 24 Hours in Police Custody about male rape that was pure PSB Also on the horizon for The Garden is Channel 4 's Dark Phone telling the story of an extraordinary police operation to access an encrypted phone network used by organized crime groups around the world which took place four years ago Although The Garden is desperate to get it on air Brown revealed that premiere has been pushed back due to legal proceedings For 74 days the messages sent and received on 60000 handsets were covertly captured by police and Brown said the mundane messages contained in the treasure trove are as interesting an insight into criminality as the standout ones Hay added The everyday chatter takes you there in a way that nothing else ever would and as ever proves that unscripted is weirder than scripted in that world There 's a real sense watching it what it must be like to be in their heads Subscribe to Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy",

    "excerpt": "We are entering a new era of science investigations from our nearest neighbor in space",
    "summary": "Space scientists are eager to protect the option of doing astronomy from the moon There are plans in the works to place astronomical hardware on the lunar landscape such as super cooled infrared telescopes a swath of gravitational wave detectors large Arecibo like radio telescopes even peek a boo instruments tuned up to seek out evidence for out there aliens Yes the future of lunar astronomy beckons But some scientists say there 's an urgent need to protect any moon based astronomical equipment from interference caused by other planned activities on the moon ensuring they can carry out their mission of probing the surrounding universe To that end efforts are ongoing to scope out and create policy in conjunction with the United Nations in the hope of fostering international support for such protections Related Gravitational wave detectors on the moon could be more sensitive than those on Earth This action plan is spearheaded by the International Astronomical Union IAU The IAU brings together more than 12000 active professional astronomers from over 100 countries worldwide Richard Green is chair of the IAU group specific to looking at the issues of staging astronomy from the moon He is also an assistant director for government relations at Steward Observatory run by the University of Arizona in Tucson The IAU working group is aiming to collaborate with a number of other non governmental organizations to protect the option of doing astronomy from the moon Green tells Space.com A number of participants in the IAU working group are spectrum managers from radio observatories strongly linked to the International Telecommunication Union ITU and ITU 's World Radiocommunication Conference a treaty level forum to review and revise if necessary radio regulations and global agreements regarding use of the radio frequency spectrum and the geostationary satellite and non geostationary satellite orbits The working group members want to maximize the range of protected frequencies including the very low frequencies needed to study the early universe and auroral emissions from planets Green says Equitable access The other approach says Green is for protection of sites on the moon that might be suitable for cooled infrared telescopes or gravitational wave detector arrays We have common cause with those who want to protect historical legacy sites and even those who want dedicated sites for extracting water or minerals Green says We imagine that the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space is the venue in which some process can be developed to claim a site for protection and to resolve competing claims The IAU Astronomy from the moon working group has space law and policy experts who can provide a strong basis for that approach Green says Of course the main goal is to conduct astronomical observations that can be uniquely done from the moon Green explains The working group is embracing the expertise of principal investigators of lunar missions or concepts for missions Doing so Green says can help engage the astronomical community in prioritizing sites of extreme scientific interest and take in issues of conducting science in an environment for which equitable access is anchored in the spirit of the United Nations 1967 Outer Space Treaty Image credit Volodymyr Vustyansky A thumbs up approval of the IAU initiative is Ian Crawford a professor of planetary science and astrobiology at Birkbeck College London My own view is that a subset of lunar locations for example specific polar craters and key far side locations need to be designated as Sites of Special Scientific Importance and protected as such Crawford told Space.com A possible model Crawford suggests might be the Antarctic Specially Protected Areas ASPAs as defined in Annex V of the Environmental Protocol to the Antarctic Treaty In any case international coordination is clearly required so United Nations involvement appears entirely appropriate Crawford says Private partnerships NASA is working with several U.S. firms to deliver science and technology to the moon 's surface by way of the Commercial Lunar Payload Services CLPS initiative Given the uptick in future CLPS enabled robotic lunar exploration we are about to the see the first NASA funded science payloads landed there in over 51 years since the Apollo 17 human moon landing in December 1972 says Jack Burns professor emeritus in the department of astrophysical and planetary sciences at the University of Colorado Boulder One payload for which Burns serves as co investigator is called the Radio Wave Observations on the Lunar Surface of the photoElectron Sheath ROLSES If successful it would be the first radio telescope on the moon and situated at the lunar south pole ROLSES is to be emplaced there in February via the Intuitive Machines Nova C lunar lander 's IM-1 mission under the CLPS partnership Firefly Aerospace 's Blue Ghost Mission-2 lander which will carry the Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment Night LuSEE Night to probe the dark ages of the early universe Image credit Firefly Aerospace This will be followed in two years by the Lunar Surface Electromagnetics Experiment Night or LuSEE Night slated to fly in 2026 aboard the Firefly Aerospace Blue Ghost Mission-2 lander This endeavor is also part of the CLPS undertaking and Burns is a science team member of the LUNAR far side experiment LuSee Night is a radio telescope that will look into the never before seen dark ages of the early universe a time before the birth of the first stars Science fact With this potential and promising burgeoning of radio astronomy from the moon Burns says it is essential that we now develop international agreements to protect the far side of the moon for radio astronomy as it is the only truly radio quiet site in the inner solar system Burns emphasizes that radio observations from the moon are no longer science fiction but science

Gregory Smith placed the marker to promote regional pride and as a kind of offbeat tourist attraction News reports at the time noted there was much excitement at the slaying of the animal The monument was originally laid horizontally in the ground This caused it to get constantly covered in dirt leaves and snow Wishing to preserve local history and perhaps legend in the summer of 2023 a group of volunteers relocated the marker a few feet from its original location and attached it to a nearby boulder using hydraulic cement and steel rebar Once a landmark that was simply stumbled upon if you were lucky many explorers gave up in frustration today a short trail is clearly marked as Wolf Monument Way The stone 's inscription reads On this spot in the year 1839 Lawrence Brainerd shot a grey wolf which had been ravaging the Northeast part of Franklin Co.

    "title": "CU Boulder creates Coach Prime inspired sports media class",
    "excerpt": "A new Coach Prime inspired class launched at the University of Colorado Boulder this month and Coach Prime himself is scheduled to visit as a guest speaker",
    "summary": "A new Coach Prime inspired class launched at the University of Colorado Boulder this month and Deion Sanders himself appeared as a guest speaker The new course called Prime Time Public Performance and Leadership is a NIL themed course exploring the rights of college athletes to control and profit from their name image and likeness We do call the course Prime Time but that is drawing on that metaphor about how athletes have to perform certain celebrity functions said Rick Stevens associate dean for undergraduate education in the College of Media Communication and Information They have to have a personality off the field in the media that is a culmination of their endorsements their public persona their communication of their public self that becomes an image that they trade on Although the class is named after him it 's not about Deion Sanders and his career However Sanders will visit the class twice as a guest speaker During his first visit he spoke about social media He just generally wanted to come and talk to the students first about the social media aspect which is great Stevens said We have faculty that have expertise in social media and teach that but having someone talk to our students that has that level of experience is pretty important That 's going to give students a really interesting view Senior Kyle Smith said it 's exciting to have experts from the sports industry come to class including Coach Prime There are 10 guest speakers from within CU Boulder or that are alumni including former NFL player and CU Buffs quarterback Kordell Stewart USA Today Sports Reporter Brent Schrotenboer and Tom Garfinkel the president of the Miami Dolphins I do n't want to say I 'm star stuck or anything but it is pretty cool it adds an element of excitement to the class Smith said But students are really engaged and want to learn more because these professional athletes and speakers are coming in and you want to learn what they 're talking about The class is being co taught by 12 faculty members from five different departments The class is mainly targeted for student athletes journalism students and students interested in sports business This is one of those situations where in the last couple of years we had seen suddenly the landscape of collegiate sports shifting Stevens said We had seen formerly purely amateur regulated student athletes suddenly get the ability to earn some income off of their likeness and very little regulations or guidelines on how that 's supposed to happen The course will cover sports culture history changing legal landscape media culture celebrity theory social media advertising and branding and public relations Discussions will be about the business of sports and how it evolves around collegiate athletics and thinking about student athletes as a new kind of celebrity Stevens said the goal is to teach the student athletes in the class about how to use their voice in spotlight attract commercial attention be able to speak about social justice issues develop a personal brand and more It 's about thinking about that Prime Time persona the Prime Time moment that an athlete has Stevens said The course also aims to teach journalism students how they should think about covering NIL issues and develop empathy for 18- and 19 year olds who are trying to form public identities For the sports business side Stevens said he wants students to know how the system works We want there to be more critical thinking around a lot of these changing situations so that students can add to whatever career they are pursuing related to these topics Stevens said Jamie Skerski associate teaching professor in communications will teach about the intersection of communication and culture and thinking about sports as an entertainment industry Her goal is to nuance the conversation around NIL and the transfer portal and how the college athletic system is changing while also thinking about gender College athletics is a different beast than it was even three or four years ago Skerski said And so for me if we 're training sports journalists it 's important for them to understand the history and context of these changes and who benefits from these changes Senior Nick Wilson wants to be a manager in the music or sports industry and hopes to gain a better understanding of NIL deals and how to negotiate them Wilson said he enjoys the class structure with its combination of guest lecturers and multiple professors It makes the class more exciting and makes me actually want to dig into this stuff a little more Wilson said It 's an exciting opportunity to see Prime Time and connect with the players and everyone else Pat Ferrucci associate professor and chair of the journalism department will focus on teaching about leadership and how leadership can affect people and transform an organization He hopes students take away how connected sports are to economics culture fandom gender race and more I hope that they take away how complicated everything is Ferrucci said That 's something that no matter what we 're teaching students I hope comes together Sophomore Ashlin Stasswender Swasey said she 's excited about the class because of the unique opportunity of having guest speakers I 'm hoping to get a better understanding about the intersection between athletes and celebrity how that 's formulated and the impact that has she said Skerski said NIL opened up a lot of questions and no one knows how it 's going to work Part of the course is to think about how to do it equitably I hope students start thinking critically about sport as an institution that it 's not a about the wins and losses or necessarily the players it 's about the way sport is a microcosm of society Skerski said As an entertainment industry what are all the factors in the cultural production that is taking place with sport in the way we value certain sports like football for instance over others Or why do some sports have television contracts and broadcasting rights and others do n't I hope students start thinking about sport as a very influential way that whether you 're a sports fan or not you learn about culture",

or L.A. social media sites like TikTok and Instagram help speed things up So we 're getting out our crystal ball to predict what will be hot this year with restaurants and bars Here are nine food and drink trends you might catch a glimpse of in local kitchens in 2024 MakFam 's MSGin is a playful riff on a gin martini with Chinese plum brine and MSG Provided by MAKfam MSG Monosodium glutamate MSG is a food additive used to enhance flavor and local spots like MAKfam and Death Company are embracing the ingredient to dispel the common misconception that MSG is any worse for you than anything else Denver cocktail bar Death Co. on the ground floor of the Ramble Hotel in RiNo recently introduced its Wavelength cocktail with Chardonnay barrel aged gin bitters sherry tomato passion fruit and MSG MAKfam a Cantonese restaurant that opened in October has a playful piece of art on its wall featuring the slogan It 's better with MSG as well as a riff on a gin martini dubbed MSGin with Chinese plum brine and MSG We 're proud to say we use MSG in our food and I feel like there 's a lot of negative connotation with it but you could say the same thing about sugar and we want to take that idea back co owner Kenneth Wan previously told The Denver Post At Cantina Loca the Espresso Martinez is made with Fruitful Coconut Liqueur 477 Coffee Liqueur Bluegrass Cold Brew Aztec Chocolate Bitters and agave syrup Provided by Cantina Loca Espresso martinis The espresso martini 's recent revival has given diners a pep in their step whether you prefer the caffeine infused cocktail for a jolt of energy before dinner or paired with dessert to end the meal Denver restaurants are n't missing out on this three bean trend and nearly every drink menu boasts some sort of rendition of the creamy cocktail

more diners take their turns at Dry January Denver restaurants like Rooted Craft Kitchen in Highland have created zero proof elixirs that make it easy to forget why you ever needed to add alcohol to it in the first place Level up your mocktail game with the Yuz Me Up $ 10 with yuzu Fresno peppers rice wine vinegar and tonic Having interesting non alcoholic beverages is a must for any restaurant in 2024 with more people choosing not to consume booze yet still wanting a well crafted cocktail said Rooted co owner and beverage director Scott Ericson Our shrubs have an intensity of flavor with a

Blackbelly 's in house butcher program and work with local ranchers and farmers or Bruto 's food waste management through fermentation and its in house milling process And this year we 're going to see an emphasis on sustainable sources among restaurant menus like C Burger by local restaurateur Bryan Dayton who 's behind popular spots like Corrida Oak at Fourteenth and Brider C Burger which has

Denver restaurants are embracing the girl dinner as more diners choose to nibble on a spread of small bites rather than indulging in a large hearty entree Spots like Safta and Ash'Kara are already

Dylan Roberts who 's set to sponsor the bill in the state Senate She called Catlin shortly after not knowing that Catlin had also recently heard from a different constituent whose friend had lost a son to the poison Catlin said he wanted to intervene and limit sodium nitrite 's availability before its use became an epidemic Amabile said she planned to bring a bill in the future to address websites that promoted death by sodium nitrite and suicide generally dark corners of the internet that Brown said were run by grim reapers On Thursday an Erie family Peter Frankovsky his wife Suzanne and their son Quinn told legislators about Sam Frankovsky their son and brother who died by suicide after ingesting the poison The world is an absolute worse place because of his absence Quinn Frankovsky said of his brother My family and I do not want to be here It has felt like we are living new lives as if our home has figuratively burned down But it is the duty of the burdened to not stand idly by watching this figurative fire burn down the houses and lives of our brothers and sisters It is our civic and moral duty to extinguish this gross product from our community",

    "summary": "Every year The New York Times publishes a list titled 52 Places to Go and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming But most of those far flung locales are bucket listers the kinds of destinations that make for a once in a lifetime trip or a special adventure So we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024 but with more manageable goals and with a nod toward Colorado connections We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport because travel is already difficult these days prices crowds cancellations Why make it any harder Here are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year broken down into destinations in Colorado elsewhere in the United States and other countries or overseas Bon voyage IN COLORADO A view from the Curecanti Creek Trail at the on July 29 2020 Photo by RJ Sangosti The Denver Post This year marks the 25th anniversary of Colorado 's fourth and least visited member of the nation 's most prestigious open space club Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways from scenic drives and rim side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes Montrose about five hours from Denver is a popular kickoff point Camp Hale Continental Divide National Monument Designating the 84500 acres where Colorado 's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 did n't change it much The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing snowmobiling and ATV riding But it 's gorgeous country and worth a stay at the campground Want to learn more about it There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind Plein air painter Remington Robinson works on a painting on the Pearl Street Mall on April 28 2023 in Boulder Photo by Helen H. Richardson The Denver Post Boulder Boulder does n't really need the attention but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado But the city is more than football and cliches In fact in November Fodor 's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 only one other U.S. destination was included The travel guide honed in on Boulder 's scenery open space and accessibility to recreation and nature as well as the Pearl Street Mall 's dining options We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries as well as a Michelin starred restaurant Frasca Craft beer highway The origins of Colorado 's craft beer culture date back to 1979 when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287 between Broomfield and Fort Collins In fact you could call this 50 mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway Wanna get a taste Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures some of which like Liquid Mechanics Cellar West Verboten and Zwei are among the best small breweries in the state Mount Blue Sky It 's not the tallest mountain in Colorado but it 's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best known peaks in the state And last September Mount Evans at 14130 feet was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups With the change it 's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of although not in winter The views up there are gorgeous and there is a good chance you 'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way Iron Mountain Hot Springs Photo provided by Iron Mountain Hot Springs Glenwood Springs There 's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak 's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon but also the less often seen backside of Denver and its suburbs Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years with big changes already completed or still on their way to some of its hot springs like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs among others The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite a stroll some entertainment and a beer perhaps from Casey Brewing Blending 's lively taproom Amache National Historic Site Wanna get away You do n't need Southwest Airlines Just drive east from the Front Range at any time of year really in the opposite direction of where most people are headed One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site which became part of the National Park System in 2022 Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II Today there is a cemetery a monument and landscaping to explore and to remember Mountain Plover Festival Karval Speaking of eastern Colorado one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April it 's April 26 28 this year in Karval What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different There are no motels or restaurants in Karval so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families meals and entertainment are provided So in addition to bird watching tours mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see you learn about the history and community of the area Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County IN THE UNITED STATES Fans watch the Colorado Rockies and the Arizona Diamondbacks during a spring training Cactus League game at Salt River Fields at Talking Stick on Feb. 25 2023 in Scottsdale Arizona Photo by RJ Sangosti The Denver Post Spring training in Arizona No matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball 's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix Tempe Scottsdale area can be a magical experience And as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale it 's also a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s a nice break from cold Colorado weather and there are pools aplenty Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument Arizona Grand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system with nearly 5 million visitors per year but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites The national monument is n't that easy to visit since it consists mostly of open space but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest A large bowl of roasted green chile at a market in Hatch N.M. in 2021 AP Photo Susan Montoya Bryan File Hatch N.M.

DIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville N.C. in September and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver 's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months Fort Collins founded New Belgium also has a taproom there But Asheville set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway should be on any Coloradan 's list anyway because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene it 's an outdoor lovers mountain playground Vice President Kamala Harris right greets National Parks Service Superintendent Shirley MaKinney during a visit to the Stonewall Inn and National Monument

Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium the date is still TBA the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism Feb. 25 June 28 Plus you can get your fill of ramen pizza bagels and dumplings which is always a reason for joy Cleveland Ah the Land A city on the comeback Cleveland is a shortish trip by air and in 2024 it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse or the path of totality which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8 Why Cleveland Well there is a small and lesser known national park just 30 minutes away called Cuyahoga Valley which will be celebrating And while you 're in the vicinity take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day The mountains here are stunning certainly but let 's face it Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii 's major islands but and Hapuna Beach might be the most beautiful of them all Expansive warm and a great place to snorkel Hapuna is truly mesmerizing But do n't stop there In addition to Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines the Big Island also boasts white sand green sand and black sand beaches Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa a visit here is the cure to cabin fever OVERSEAS The Olympic Games are coming to Paris this summer AP Photo Francois Mori File Paris Maybe it does n't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest busiest most congested time of the year Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need Either way there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26 Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years and if the Olympics are n't your thing then consider this Notre Dame Cathedral which nearly burned down in 2019 is set to reopen in December 2024 Dublin For being the sixth busiest airport in the entire world DIA does n't have many direct nonstop international flights So it 's worth celebrating each and every new one In May Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin Ireland 's lively capital city The historic sites here go back more than 1000 years and you can and should tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside including the Cliffs of Moher Giant 's Causeway and Killarney National Park Visitors to Iceland 's Blue Lagoon spa swim in pools of milky blue 99 degree geothermal waters Iceland Also on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland with its waterfalls blue lagoons and adorable puffins The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland Tokyo Japan 's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver and it 's worth the trip The city is like no other place in the world and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood It 's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining recreation or just people watching There 's also craft beer whiskey manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers Morning at Jakes in Treasure Beach St. Elizabeth Jamaica Provided by Jakes hotel Jamaica Last February Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay Jamaica cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day with a stopover as we wrote in a travel guide to the country 's tourist capital So for laid back beach bars

been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade with several neighborhoods teeming with art culture and

    "excerpt": "Ski bikes are still only a tiny segment of the snow sports landscape but the industry appears to be picking up some momentum",
    "summary": "The reason Ryan Madsen is part of a small but growing cadre of ski bike enthusiasts on Colorado slopes is n't very complicated and he has a ready answer for anyone who asks Because the 46 year old Texan says I suck at skiing He 's taken lessons plenty of times on his annual ski trips with family and friends but never gotten the hang of it When others would head for the lifts he would find something else to do They would always get up on the mountain and enjoy it Madsen said and the rest of us would just find a bar and drink That changed three years ago at Breckenridge when Madsen noticed a business renting ski bikes and offering introductory tours He gave one a try with a buddy and was hooked the first day We spent maybe 30 minutes getting the how to on everything Madsen said Before we knew it we were on a blue run and after that we were on a black on the first day Ski bikes are still only a tiny segment of the snow sports landscape but the industry appears to be picking up some momentum That 's partly because they are proving attractive to people with knees and backs that have some mileage on them not to mention folks who appreciate a learning curve that often proves faster than for skiing and snowboarding Most Colorado ski areas allow them including all four resorts in Summit County the four Aspen Snowmass mountains Vail and Beaver Creek Crested Butte Steamboat Copper Mountain and Winter Park The few that ban them tend to be small or mid sized areas such as Loveland Monarch Sunlight and Wolf Creek Ski bikes got some unwelcome publicity earlier this month when a ski biker struck and injured two skiers at Keystone one of them seriously and fled the scene The Summit County Sheriff found and cited a 50 year old Louisiana man according to news reports The case has been sent to the Summit County DA 's office Patrick Neelan chairman of the American SkiBike Association said he was unaware of any statistics regarding ski bike safety as compared to skiing and snowboarding Because the market share is so small it has not been studied Neelan said In my ski biking career that goes back to 2007 this Keystone accident is the first time I 've ever heard of someone else being injured by a ski bike Adrienne Saia Isaac spokeswoman for the Lakewood based National Ski Areas Association says the industry welcomes ski bikers to the slopes but stresses that they have the same responsibilities under the Colorado Ski Safety Act as skiers and snowboarders Tour guide Matt Barks left explains how to ride SnoGo SkiBikes at the ski resort in Winter Park on Friday Jan. 19 2024 Photo by Hyoung Chang The Denver Post The rules apply to all who slide irrespective of how you do it Isaac said No matter what gear you 're on you have a responsibility to stay on scene when an accident happens like that and to stay in control I 'm hoping that one incident does n't tarnish the activity If you 've never been on any type of sliding equipment we recommend you take a lesson so you can prepare yourself for riding and loading and unloading the lift safely remaining in control and making sure you 're on the appropriate terrain for your ability level Katie Englen of Arvada 35 did just that last week at Winter Park She is coming back from foot surgery that put her in a boot for six months and now she 's experiencing knee issues she suspects were caused by having spent so much time on crutches She 's regained enough strength to have skinned up the mountain on skis before her ski bike lesson but she has been thinking about diversifying her winter recreation I 'm hoping to find something that 's a little easier on the knees for the long term Englen said Winter Park offers guided introductory and advanced ski bike tours using Sno Go ski bikes a leader in the industry The Sno Go design is actually a trike with one ski in the front and two in the back They have handlebars and riders lean into turns as they would while riding bicycles They have hooks for hauling them up the mountain on chairlifts Englen took a three hour tour last Friday and said she had a great time I would definitely do it again Englen said I 'd say it 's comparable to skiing maybe a little easier If you mountain bike I think you 're going to pick it up pretty quickly I wanted to diversify out of skiing so when my knees are hurting I have something else I can do on snow Also taking the introductory class at Winter Park that day was Sharon Miller of Denver 55 She 's a former Division I basketball player who suffered a hyper extended knee two seasons ago when she was struck by another skier who grabbed and pulled her down She 's been trying to strengthen that knee but it 's still not back to normal After noticing increasing numbers of ski bikes on the slopes she researched brands bought a Sno Go and signed up for the Winter Park tour It was awesome Miller said I would recommend that tour to anybody I loved the low impact And once you get the hang of it that you 're not steering the bike that you 're just leaning it 's a whole different feeling I had so much fun I do n't think I 'll get back to skiing I think this is going to be it for me Ian Hunter of Denver left and Diego Montemayor of Phoenix right learn how to make turns with SnoGo SkiBike Tours at the ski resort in Winter Park on Friday Jan. 19 2024 Photo by

the tours out of the resort 's Adventure Supply Co where they also offer guided uphilling snowshoeing and scenic snowcat rides The Sno Go tours introductory and advanced last three hours and cost $ 99 Sno Go co founder Chase Wagstaff visited last week from Utah to touch base with his Winter Park partners This is our shining star Wagstaff said Winter Park was one of our early adopters Their numbers are dwarfing what everyone else is doing so we 're taking the model these guys are doing and going around the country implementing that at other resorts Wagstaff and his co founder best friend Obed Marrder started the company with a Kickstarter campaign in 2015 after tinkering for years with prototypes Now they 've taken on a major investor who owns an indoor ski area in New Jersey An estimated 5000 Sno Gos have been sold and they 're manufacturing about 2000 annually We have a video that 's at almost 50 million views in like three weeks Wagstaff said Ski bikes come in three types Type 1 bikes have a seat a rear ski and a front ski with handlebars for steering Riders sit and wear foot skis for added stability Type 2 bikes have a rear ski a front ski with handlebars footrests and suspension systems The Type 3 Sno Go designs have three skis one in front and two in the back Sno Go bikes cost between $ 2000 and $ 3400 When you lean the handlebars left and right that 's the entire learning curve Wagstaff said All three skis are edging in parallel which is the learning curve of skiing You lean the bars left and right That 's how the bike carves and that 's how you stop Your feet are shoulder length apart You 're leaning on the bars which gives you a lot of stability Yusivia Parra from Phoenix prepares to take a chair lift with SnoGo SkiBike Tours at the ski resort in Winter Park on Friday Jan. 19 2024 Photo by Hyoung Chang The Denver Post Ski bike rentals are available through companies such as Colorado Ski Bikes and Go Enjoy Outdoors which deliver rentals by reservation Colorado Ski Bikes delivers Type 2 bikes to most Front Range resorts and several others in the state Go Enjoy Outdoors delivers Sno Go tikes in the Denver area and Winter Park About half the week we 'll do rentals and services out of the Denver and Boulder area said Emma Hazley who owns Go Enjoy Outdoors with her husband Garrett On the weekends we 're based out of Winter Park and Fraser We 'll meet them on the way to the mountains on the way home from the mountains Ski bikes also are popular in adaptive programs including Winter Park 's National Sports Center for the Disabled Roger Black who helps run Winter Park 's tours had a man in his 50s last year who had been a lifelong skier before developing Parkinson 's Disease It basically took skiing away from him Black said It affected his left leg it was really shaky and he could n't put a ton of weight on it He came out and signed up for the entry tour It took him a little extra time like half an hour more to learn He eventually loved it I saw him the next week at Steamboat with his own purchased Sno Go having the time of his life so happy to be able to get out and glide around on the mountain again",

    "summary": "Every year The New York Times publishes a list titled 52 Places to Go and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming But most of those far flung locales are bucket listers the kinds of destinations that make for a once in a lifetime trip or a special adventure So we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024 but with more manageable goals and with a nod toward Colorado connections We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport because travel is already difficult these days prices crowds cancellations Why make it any harder Here are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year broken down into destinations in Colorado elsewhere in the United States and other countries or overseas Bon voyage IN COLORADO This year marks the 25th anniversary of Colorado 's fourth and least visited member of the nation 's most prestigious open space club Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways from scenic drives and rim side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes Montrose about five hours from Denver is a popular kickoff point Camp Hale Continental Divide National Monument Designating the 84500 acres where Colorado 's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 did n't change it much The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing snowmobiling and ATV riding But it 's gorgeous country and worth a stay at the campground Want to learn more about it There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind Boulder Boulder does n't really need the attention but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado But the city is more than football and cliches In fact in November Fodor 's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 only one other U.S. destination was included The travel guide honed in on Boulder 's scenery open space and accessibility to recreation and nature as well as the Pearl Street Mall 's dining options We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries as well as a Michelin starred restaurant Frasca Craft beer highway The origins of Colorado 's craft beer culture date back to 1979 when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene about 10 minutes west of U.S. 287 in Longmont There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287 between Broomfield and Fort Collins In fact you could call this 50 mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway Wanna get a taste Find a designated driver and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures some of which like Liquid Mechanics Cellar West Verboten and Zwei are among the best small breweries in the state Mount Blue Sky It 's not the tallest mountain in Colorado but it 's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best known peaks in the state And last September Mount Evans at 14130 feet was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups With the change it 's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of although not in winter The views up there are gorgeous and there is a good chance you 'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way Glenwood Springs There 's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak 's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon but also the less often seen backside of Denver and its suburbs Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years with big changes already completed or still on their way to some of its hot springs like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs among others The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite a stroll some entertainment and a beer perhaps from Casey Brewing Blending 's lively taproom Amache National Historic Site Wanna get away You do n't need Southwest Airlines Just drive east from the Front Range at any time of year really in the opposite direction of where most people are headed One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site which became part of the National Park System in 2022 Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II Today there is a cemetery a monument and landscaping to explore and to remember Mountain Plover Festival Karval Speaking of eastern Colorado one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April it 's April 26 28 this year in Karval What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different There are no motels or restaurants in Karval so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families meals and entertainment are provided So in addition to bird watching tours mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see you learn about the history and community of the area Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County IN THE UNITED STATES Spring training in Arizona No matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball 's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix Tempe Scottsdale area can be a magical experience And as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale it 's also a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s a nice break from cold Colorado weather and there are pools aplenty Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument Arizona Grand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system with nearly 5 million visitors per year but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites The national monument is n't that easy to visit since it consists mostly of open space but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest Hatch N.M. The great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch N.M. an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles Other things to see in the area White Sands Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie and Oscar nominee Oppenheimer Make sure to stop in Pueblo Colo. on your way back up Interstate 25 though that 's the heart of Colorado 's own green chile country so you can settle the debate for yourself Asheville N.C. DIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville N.C. in September and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver 's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months Fort Collins founded New Belgium also has a taproom there But Asheville set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway should be on any Coloradan 's list anyway because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene it 's an outdoor lovers mountain playground New York City There 's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium the date is still TBA the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism Feb. 25 June 28 Plus you can get your fill of ramen pizza bagels and dumplings which is always a reason for joy Cleveland Ah the Land A city on the comeback Cleveland is a shortish trip by air and in 2024 it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse or the path of totality which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8 Why Cleveland Well there is a small and lesser known national park just 30 minutes away called Cuyahoga Valley which will be celebrating the eclipse with ranger led activities And while you 're in the vicinity take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day The mountains here are stunning certainly but let 's face it Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii 's major islands but and Hapuna Beach might be the most beautiful of them all Expansive warm and a great place to snorkel Hapuna is truly mesmerizing But do n't stop there In addition to Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines the Big Island also boasts white sand green sand and black sand beaches Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa a visit here is the cure to cabin fever OVERSEAS Paris Maybe it does n't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest busiest most congested time of the year Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need Either way there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26 Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years and if the Olympics are n't your thing then consider this Notre Dame Cathedral which nearly burned down in 2019 is set to reopen in December 2024 Dublin For being the sixth busiest airport in the entire world DIA does n't have many direct nonstop international flights So it 's worth celebrating each and every new one In May Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin Ireland 's lively capital city The historic sites here go back more than 1000 years and you can and should tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside including the Cliffs of Moher Giant 's Causeway and Killarney National Park Iceland Also on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland with its waterfalls blue lagoons and adorable puffins The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland Tokyo Japan 's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver and it 's worth the trip The city is like no other place in the world and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood It 's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining recreation or just people watching There 's also craft beer whiskey manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers Jamaica Last February Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay Jamaica cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day with a stopover as we wrote in a travel guide to the country 's tourist capital So for laid back beach bars sizzling jerk chicken swimming holes and of course music this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean Puerto Rico Not to be outdone United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan Puerto Rico in October slashing travel time to the island by several hours Even better you do n't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters plantains and tropical rum drinks however Read more about this sunny destination along with its beaches rainforests history and culture in our recent travel guide Mexico City Mexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade with several neighborhoods teeming with art culture and cuisine Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas churros or cute coffee shops catching the spectacle of lucha libre visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia and trying chapuline with your mezcal Oh and at 7200 feet in altitude it 's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver so you should feel right at home Costa Rica The pura vida never goes out of style but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America but this is one of them Whether you want wildlife scenery great coffee rainforests beaches or culture Costa Rica offers one of the easiest most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation Banff National Park To get some perspective on Colorado 's rocky peaks take a bucket list trip to Canada 's Banff National Park where the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just do n't see in Colorado And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green according to The Denver Post 's extensive travel guide on how to travel to and camp in the park A two hour flight to Calgary followed by a 90 minute drive will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe",

    "summary": "Earth 's moon is a constant in the night sky following predictable phases in its orbit However its size likely has been changing over time A study published January 25 in the Planetary Science Journal found that the moon has shrunk more than 150 feet in circumference as its core gradually cooled over the past few hundred million years Related The moon is 40 million years older than we thought according to crystals collected by Apollo astronauts A team of scientists from NASA the Smithsonian Arizona State University and The University of Maryland discovered evidence that the continuing shrinkage led to some surface changes around the Lunar South Pole The terrain has even changed in areas where NASA hopes to land during the crewed Artemis III mission This lunar shrinking process looks similar to how a grape wrinkles when it becomes a raisin The moon also wrinkles and creases as it shrinks down However a grape has a flexible skin while the moon has a brittle surface The brittleness causes faults to form where sections of the crust push up against each other The fault formation caused by this continued shrinking often comes with seismic activity like moonquakes Any locations near these moon fault zones could pose a threat to human exploration there the same way that those living near fault lines on Earth face a greater risk of earthquakes The epicenter of one of the strongest moonquakes recorded by the Apollo Passive Seismic Experiment was located in the lunar south polar region However the exact location of the epicenter could not be accurately determined A cloud of possible locations magenta dots and light blue polygon of the strong shallow moonquake using a relocation algorithm specifically adapted for very sparse seismic networks are distributed near the pole Blue boxes show the locations of proposed Artemis III landing regions Lobate thrust fault scarps are shown by small red lines The cloud of epicenter locations encompasses a number of lobate scarps and many of the Artemis III landing regions CREDIT NASA LRO LROC ASU Smithsonian Institution In the new study the team linked a group of faults in the moon 's south polar region to a powerful moonquake recorded by Apollo seismometers over 50 years ago They used computer models to simulate the stability of surface slopes here and found that some areas in particular were vulnerable to lunar landslides from the seismic activity Our modeling suggests that shallow moonquakes capable of producing strong ground shaking in the south polar region are possible from slip events on existing faults or the formation of new thrust faults Thomas R. Watters study co author and senior scientist emeritus in the National Air and Space Museum said in a statement The global distribution of young thrust faults their potential to be active and the potential to form new thrust faults from ongoing global contraction should be considered when planning the location and stability of permanent outposts on the moon Shallow moonquakes occur only about 100 or so miles deep into the moon 's crust They are caused by faults and can be strong enough to damage equipment and human made structures Earthquakes tend to last for only a few seconds or minutes at most Shallow moonquakes can last for hours and even a whole afternoon The team connected the magnitude 5 moonquake recorded by the Apollo Passive Seismic Network in the 1970s to a group of faults detected by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter more recently This means that this seismic activity could devastate any future hypothetical settlements on the moon Related 10 incredible lunar missions that paved the way for Artemis You can think of the moon 's surface as being dry grounded gravel and dust Over billions of years the surface has been hit by asteroids and comets with the resulting angular fragments constantly getting ejected from the impacts study co author and University of Maryland geologist Nicholas Schmerr said in a statement As a result the reworked surface material can be micron sized to boulder sized but all very loosely consolidated Loose sediments make it very possible for shaking and landslides to occur Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera LROC Narrow Angle Camera NAC mosaic of the Wiechert cluster of lobate scarps left pointing arrows near the lunar south pole A thrust fault scarp cut across an approximately 1 kilometer 0.6 mile diameter degraded crater right pointing arrow CREDIT NASA LRO LROC ASU Smithsonian Institution The team will continue to map out this seismic activity on the moon hoping to pinpoint more locations that could be dangerous for human exploration NASA 's Artemis missions are currently scheduled to launch their first crewed flight in September 2025 with a crewed moon landing scheduled for September 2026 One of the ultimate goals of these future missions is a long term human presence on the moon As we get closer to the crewed Artemis mission 's launch date it 's important to keep our astronauts our equipment and infrastructure as safe as possible Schmerr said This work is helping us prepare for what awaits us on the moon whether that 's engineering structures that can better withstand lunar seismic activity or protecting people from really dangerous zones",

Robbie or Greta Gerwig for Best Director File Photo by Jim Ruymen UPI | License Photo Jan. 24 UPI The blockbuster female empowerment comedy Barbie was nominated for eight Oscars including Best Picture but the absence of Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie in the Best Director and Best Actress categories was met with widespread disappointment and even outrage The Women Film Critics Circle voted Barbie as the Best Film About Women of 2023 It was also the highest grossing movie of the year and the highest grossing movie ever made by a woman with nearly $ 1.4 billion in box office receipts Robbie 's nominated co stars America Ferrera and Ryan Gosling tempered their glee for their own mentions in the Best Supporting Actress and Actor races with their shock that Gerwig and Robbie were n't given more credit No recognition would be possible for anyone on the film without their talent grit and genius Gosling said in a statement Tuesday after the nominations were announced To say that I 'm disappointed that they are not nominated in their respective categories would be an understatement Ferrera agreed Greta has done just about everything that a director could do to deserve it the actress told Variety Creating this world and taking something that did n't have inherent value to most people and making it a global phenomenon It feels disappointing to not see her on that list Gerwig 40 was nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay along with her husband co writer Noah Bombach and she and Robbie are credited as producers so they will take home Oscars should the movie win Best Picture But many say that is not enough Detractors are accusing the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences of sexism by continually ignoring the contributions of women artists most recently and egregiously by omitting Gerwig and Robbie from the five person categories in which they were eligible given their presence in other recent competitions Gerwig the first filmmaker in history to have her first three solo features Lady Bird Little Women and Barbie nominated for the Best Picture Oscar is up for the Directors Guild of America award Robbie has been nominated for Screen Actors Guild BAFTA Critics Choice and Golden Globe awards for her performance The directing branch of the Oscars academy is still about 80 male Barbie was not looked at as a serious movie like Oppenheimer was But it 's still ridiculous Women directors are always pushing a boulder uphill even those directing a big budget studio film The fact that the film received a Best Picture nomination without a nomination for Gerwig adds insult to injury Women and Hollywood columnist Melissa Silverstein wrote in an email newsletter Nothing will take away from what Greta Gerwig and Margot Robbie have accomplished It was a radical feminist look at womanhood in our world and while awards are awesome Greta can do whatever the expletive she wants now Best Director nom or not MSNBC host Jennifer Palmieri posted on X Both Gerwig and Robbie ignored it 's still so easy for Hollywood to overlook and discount artistic contributions of women EVEN WHEN ITS THE POINT OF THE YEAR 'S BIGGEST MOVIE My God It was nominated for best picture Did n't direct itself friends Others voicing their opinions pointed out the academy 's traditional preference for artistic independent films prestigious historical epics and heart breaking dramas over more popular fare like Dune Top Gun Maverick or Avatar The Way of Water Comedies that have won in recent years have been quirky esoteric stories such as Everything Everywhere All at Once 2023 Parasite 2019 and Birdman 2014 as opposed to crowd pleasers like Barbie I do think that the Academy membership has a bit of a bias unconscious or otherwise against true comedies and toward heavier dramas Dave Karger Turner Classic Movies host and author of 50 Oscar Nights told People on Wednesday Even though Gerwig and Robbie both received nominations for their work on Barbie in other categories these two high profile omissions will be remembered and they will sting for a long time Barbie along with the historical epic Oppenheimer made up last summer 's Barbernheimer

only one had millions of moviegoers flocking to theaters in peppy pink attire Deadly serious Oppenheimer starred Cillian Murphy as Robert Oppenheimer the real life father of the atomic bomb The period

    "summary": "Pickleball in paradise It 's not a Jimmy Buffett song it 's the concept behind the newly opened indoor pickleball facility in Lincoln Park where palm fronds and cabanas flank eight indoor courts It 's called SPF short for Social Pickleball and Fun but also sunscreen and located at 2121 N. Clybourn Ave We wanted to create an experience that went beyond just pickleball and gave people that getaway vibe said co owner Rich Green 42 Pingpong tables shuffleboard Pop a Shot air hockey cornhole and glow in the dark pickleball under a black light are a few of the options available in the 42000 square foot space that previously housed Brooklyn Boulders an indoor climbing facility A cafe counter near the entrance offers sandwiches salads and coffee A full bar is nearby Slushy drinks can be ordered to cabanas via QR code And a full kitchen is slated to open later this year in partnership with the folks behind Honey Butter Fried Chicken that will offer something akin to a surf shack menu But perhaps the most appealing aspect for picklers They wo n't have to compete for court time with tennis players a common source of friction that 's plagued the pickleball community in Chicago as players seek out public spaces mostly tennis courts that double as pickleball courts We do n't get the glares from the tennis people It 's ours This is ours Antigone Polite 60 a scientist from Lincoln Park said during a break from a pickle game at SPF We knew there was this pent up demand for the indoor pickle experience in the city so we wanted to deliver the eight courts in winter as quickly as we could Green said noting that a ninth court will be added in the coming weeks as will more cabanas No membership is required Open play the sports equivalent of pickup basketball is offered for $ 8 or $ 10 an hour depending on whether it 's during peak or off peak hours Courts can also be reserved for $ 40 or $ 60 an hour SPF has a membership program for $ 59 a month or $ 599 for the year that offers priority reservations use of locker rooms and saunas and discounts on food and drinks Membership will be capped at 500 and nearly 475 people had already signed up Green said It ca n't get better than this place said Sarah Rynbrandt 33 a vascular ultrasound technician from Roscoe Village who plays pickleball 10 times a week a not uncommon amount among legions of hardcore picklers This is just spectacular Phenomenal said Ed Barnett 87 of Lincoln Park who plays three times a week He normally plays during warm weather months at Mandrake Park 3858 S. Cottage Grove Ave or Fosco Park 1312 S. Racine Ave During winter many picklers play in the gymnasiums of Chicago Park District field houses but the wood surface is n't ideal they say Courts at SPF are made with a material used by the Professional Pickleball Association which provides better bounce and a bit of cushion that 's easier on the joints Green said The noise from pickleball the whack of a racket on a hollow ball can be a nuisance to neighbors in public spaces but is confined to the SPF building Measures were even taken to soften the acoustics so people hanging out courtside can comfortably chat Green said A total of 170 parking spaces are available for customers And professional players are on hand to teach lessons An introductory program for kids has been dubbed the Cucumber Club Parents can inconspicuously watch from a balcony viewing area Green who lives less than a block away from SPF and has a background in real estate law had a eureka moment while playing pickleball with his wife Lisa Rella at a facility in Fort Worth Texas that offered ambiance food and play Next to us was a grandmother playing with her grandkid and a bachelorette party was playing next to us on other side and we were like What kind of concept is doing this bringing so many types of people into a facility and they 're all all having the best times of their lives and everyone is interacting in some way Green said He pitched the idea to two friends from his days at Duke University who ultimately signed on as co owners One was David Galst who has a background creating experiential fun houses like Luna Park an amusement park on Coney Island The other is Chris Boston who has experience in construction and finance Both live in New York but have been frequent visitors to Chicago in recent months as they prepared SPF for opening Before greenlighting the project Green checked out pickleball locations on two road trips one along the Eastern Seaboard the other across the Midwest with his 10 year old son tagging along Another detail that factored into the decision Chicago has been way behind the rest of the country in building courts to accommodate what 's been widely hailed as the fastest growing sport in the country The park district offers more than 100 pickleball courts at about 40 parks and field house gymns A few private businesses in the city operate courts like Big City Pickle and the School House And several private fitness clubs do also but nothing is comparable to what SPF brings to Chicago We saw the public data on the shortage of courts and there are still so many people who have n't even been exposed to the game Why is Chicago so behind I do n't know it does n't make any sense Green said",

    "summary": "By Brad Brooks Jan 23 Reuters Jury selection begins in Michigan on Tuesday in a rare trial of a parent who prosecutors have charged with being complicit in a mass shooting carried out by her son Lawyers were set to start questioning prospective jurors in the manslaughter trial of Jennifer Crumbley whose then-15 year old son Ethan murdered four fellow students at Oxford High School in 2021 with a gun his parents had given him as a Christmas gift Ethan Crumbley pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts including four of first degree murder and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole Jennifer Crumbley and her husband James Crumbley were being tried separately after being charged with four manslaughter counts in late 2021 They have remained in jail since James Crumbley 's trial opens on March 5 When the charges were announced prosecutors said the Crumbley 's failure to both secure the gun in their home and to respond to warnings that their son Ethan was violent and disturbed justified the charges they face Defense attorneys have said in court documents that the Crumbleys had no way of knowing their son was going to carry out the shooting Legal experts have said that the parents trial which appears to be the first of its kind breaks new legal ground Josh Horwitz co director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions said school shooter 's parents are often not held to account because of feelings that they 've been through enough or because of lax enforcement of such measures as safe storage laws Holding more parents responsible when appropriate is an important step Horwitz said given that studies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have shown that around 75 of all school shooters obtained their weapons in the home Rarely are high school shooters going out and buying guns from a gun store Horwitz said The broader lesson from this case is that every parent who is a gun owner has a role to play and that 's the secure and safe storage of firearms PREVENTABLE TRAGEDY Four days before the Nov. 30 2021 shooting Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop where James Crumbley bought a 9 mm handgun prosecutors said Michigan law prohibits those under 18 years of age from buying or possessing firearms except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult Ethan posted photos of the gun on social media writing Just got my new beauty today and adding a heart emoji The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range testing out his new Christmas present Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said when she announced charges against the parents The day before the shooting at the school near Detroit a teacher found Ethan Crumbley using his smart phone to search for ammunition and alerted school officials The officials left messages for his mother that went unreturned His mother later texted him LOL I 'm not mad at you You have to learn not to get caught On the morning of the shooting a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun a bullet and a bleeding figure next to the words Blood everywhere My life is useless and The thoughts wo n't stop help me Ethan told school counselors the drawings were for a video game he was designing school officials have said The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home prosecutors have said The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing prosecutors say This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter 's parents had n't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the shooter or if his parents had taken basic steps to securely store the gun said Nick Suplina senior vice president of Law and Policy at the anti gun violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety They should be held accountable Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont Colorado editing by Donna Bryson and Michael Perry",

Rachel Woolf for NPR He argues that processed food is already subsidized so it 's not a fair fight Jim Krieger executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America says Guttridge is right There 's lots of subsidies for soy and corn they 're key ingredients for ultra processed foods which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables Krieger says Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they 're forced to use them in the local food system but Boulder county is n't taking that approach Instead of sticks they 're using carrots trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown in competition A force for good Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont Colo. Boulder County Farmer 's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery Mackenzie Sehlke the organization 's executive director pulls open the door of a walk in refrigerator A lot of storage crops in here right now she says MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer 's Markets Rachel Woolf for NPR Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community We have a large Nepalese community here she says So we 're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow she says I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here she says Yes she acknowledges there are plenty of big structural problems with America 's food system but she 's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool she says And I 've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently Policy can be a force for good she says to forge connections between farmer market and hungry resident so it 's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food Photography by Rachel Woolf Katie Hayes Luke edited visuals for this story Diane Webber edited the radio and digital versions of the story",

    "summary": "Every year The New York Times publishes a list titled 52 Places to Go and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming But most of those far flung locales are bucket listers the kinds of destinations that make for a once in a lifetime trip or a special adventure So we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024 but with more manageable goals and with a nod toward Colorado connections We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport because travel is already difficult these days prices crowds cancellations Why make it any harder Here are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year broken down into destinations in Colorado elsewhere in the United States and other countries or overseas Bon voyage IN COLORADO This year marks the 25th anniversary of Colorado 's fourth and least visited member of the nation 's most prestigious open space club Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways from scenic drives and rim side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes Montrose about five hours from Denver is a popular kickoff point Camp Hale Continental Divide National Monument Designating the 84500 acres where Colorado 's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 did n't change it much The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing snowmobiling and ATV riding But it 's gorgeous country and worth a stay at the campground Want to learn more about it There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind Boulder Boulder does n't really need the attention but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado But the city is more than football and cliches In fact in November Fodor 's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 only one other U.S. destination was included The travel guide honed in on Boulder 's scenery open space and accessibility to recreation and nature as well as the Pearl Street Mall 's dining options We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries as well as a Michelin starred restaurant Frasca Craft beer highway The origins of Colorado 's craft beer culture date back to 1979 when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene about 10 minutes west of U.S. 287 in Longmont There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287 between Broomfield and Fort Collins In fact you could call this 50 mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway Wanna get a taste Find a designated driver and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures some of which like Liquid Mechanics Cellar West Verboten and Zwei are among the best small breweries in the state Mount Blue Sky It 's not the tallest mountain in Colorado but it 's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best known peaks in the state And last September Mount Evans at 14130 feet was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups With the change it 's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of although not in winter The views up there are gorgeous and there is a good chance you 'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way Glenwood Springs There 's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak 's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon but also the less often seen backside of Denver and its suburbs Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years with big changes already completed or still on their way to some of its hot springs like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs among others The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite a stroll some entertainment and a beer perhaps from Casey Brewing Blending 's lively taproom Amache National Historic Site Wanna get away You do n't need Southwest Airlines Just drive east from the Front Range at any time of year really in the opposite direction of where most people are headed One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site which became part of the National Park System in 2022 Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II Today there is a cemetery a monument and landscaping to explore and to remember Mountain Plover Festival Karval Speaking of eastern Colorado one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April it 's April 26 28 this year in Karval What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different There are no motels or restaurants in Karval so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families meals and entertainment are provided So in addition to bird watching tours mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see you learn about the history and community of the area Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County IN THE UNITED STATES Spring training in Arizona No matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball 's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix Tempe Scottsdale area can be a magical experience And as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale it 's also a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s a nice break from cold Colorado weather and there are pools aplenty Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument Arizona Grand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system with nearly 5 million visitors per year but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites The national monument is n't that easy to visit since it consists mostly of open space but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest Hatch N.M. The great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch N.M. an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles Other things to see in the area White Sands Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie and Oscar nominee Oppenheimer Make sure to stop in Pueblo Colo. on your way back up Interstate 25 though that 's the heart of Colorado 's own green chile country so you can settle the debate for yourself Asheville N.C. DIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville N.C. in September and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver 's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months Fort Collins founded New Belgium also has a taproom there But Asheville set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway should be on any Coloradan 's list anyway because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene it 's an outdoor lovers mountain playground New York City There 's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium the date is still TBA the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism Feb. 25 June 28 Plus you can get your fill of ramen pizza bagels and dumplings which is always a reason for joy Cleveland Ah the Land A city on the comeback Cleveland is a shortish trip by air and in 2024 it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse or the path of totality which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8 Why Cleveland Well there is a small and lesser known national park just 30 minutes away called Cuyahoga Valley which will be celebrating the eclipse with ranger led activities And while you 're in the vicinity take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day The mountains here are stunning certainly but let 's face it Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii 's major islands but and Hapuna Beach might be the most beautiful of them all Expansive warm and a great place to snorkel Hapuna is truly mesmerizing But do n't stop there In addition to Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines the Big Island also boasts white sand green sand and black sand beaches Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa a visit here is the cure to cabin fever OVERSEAS Paris Maybe it does n't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest busiest most congested time of the year Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need Either way there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26 Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years and if the Olympics are n't your thing then consider this Notre Dame Cathedral which nearly burned down in 2019 is set to reopen in December 2024 Dublin For being the sixth busiest airport in the entire world DIA does n't have many direct nonstop international flights So it 's worth celebrating each and every new one In May Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin Ireland 's lively capital city The historic sites here go back more than 1000 years and you can and should tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside including the Cliffs of Moher Giant 's Causeway and Killarney National Park Iceland Also on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland with its waterfalls blue lagoons and adorable puffins The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland Tokyo Japan 's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver and it 's worth the trip The city is like no other place in the world and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood It 's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining recreation or just people watching There 's also craft beer whiskey manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers Jamaica Last February Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay Jamaica cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day with a stopover as we wrote in a travel guide to the country 's tourist capital So for laid back beach bars sizzling jerk chicken swimming holes and of course music this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean Puerto Rico Not to be outdone United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan Puerto Rico in October slashing travel time to the island by several hours Even better you do n't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters plantains and tropical rum drinks however Read more about this sunny destination along with its beaches rainforests history and culture in our recent travel guide Mexico City Mexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade with several neighborhoods teeming with art culture and cuisine Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas churros or cute coffee shops catching the spectacle of lucha libre visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia and trying chapuline with your mezcal Oh and at 7200 feet in altitude it 's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver so you should feel right at home Costa Rica The pura vida never goes out of style but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America but this is one of them Whether you want wildlife scenery great coffee rainforests beaches or culture Costa Rica offers one of the easiest most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation Banff National Park To get some perspective on Colorado 's rocky peaks take a bucket list trip to Canada 's Banff National Park where the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just do n't see in Colorado And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green according to The Denver Post 's extensive travel guide on how to travel to and camp in the park A two hour flight to Calgary followed by a 90 minute drive will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe",

Ah the Land A city on the comeback Cleveland is a shortish trip by air and in 2024 it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse or the path of totality which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8 Why Cleveland Well there is a small and lesser known national park just 30 minutes away called Cuyahoga Valley which will be celebrating And while you 're in the vicinity take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day The mountains here are stunning certainly but let 's face it Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii 's major islands but and Hapuna Beach might be the most beautiful of them all Expansive warm and a great place to snorkel Hapuna is truly mesmerizing But do n't stop there In addition to Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines the Big Island also boasts white sand green sand and black sand beaches Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa a visit here is the cure to cabin fever OVERSEAS The Olympic Games are coming to Paris this summer AP Photo Francois Mori File Paris Maybe it does n't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest busiest most congested time of the year Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need Either way there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26 Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years and if the Olympics are n't your thing then consider this Notre Dame Cathedral which nearly burned down in 2019 is set to reopen in December 2024 Dublin For being the sixth busiest airport in the entire world DIA does n't have many direct nonstop international flights So it 's worth celebrating each and every new one In May Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin Ireland 's lively capital city The historic sites here go back more than 1000 years and you can and should tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside including the Cliffs of Moher Giant 's Causeway and Killarney National Park Visitors to Iceland 's Blue Lagoon spa swim in pools of milky blue 99 degree geothermal waters Iceland Also on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland with its waterfalls blue lagoons and adorable puffins The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland Tokyo Japan 's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver and it 's worth the trip The city is like no other place in the world and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood It 's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining recreation or just people watching There 's also craft beer whiskey manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers Morning at Jakes in Treasure Beach St. Elizabeth Jamaica Provided by Jakes hotel Jamaica Last February Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay Jamaica cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day with a stopover as we wrote in a travel guide to the country 's tourist capital So for laid back beach bars sizzling jerk chicken swimming holes and of course music this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean Puerto Rico Not to be outdone United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan Puerto Rico in October slashing travel time to the island by several hours Even better you do n't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters plantains and tropical rum drinks however Read more about this sunny destination along with its beaches rainforests history and culture in our recent travel guide Mexico City Mexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade with several neighborhoods teeming with art culture and cuisine Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas churros or cute coffee shops catching the spectacle of lucha libre visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia and trying chapuline with your mezcal Oh and at 7200 feet in altitude it 's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver so you should feel right at home A vendor sells coconut drinks at a beach at Manuel Antonio in Costa Rica Evelyne Horovitz The Washington Post Costa Rica The pura vida never goes out of style but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America but this is one of them Whether you want wildlife scenery great coffee rainforests beaches or culture Costa Rica offers one of the easiest most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation Banff National Park To get some perspective on Colorado 's rocky peaks take a bucket list trip to Canada 's Banff National Park where the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just do n't see in Colorado And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green according to The Denver Post 's extensive travel guide on how to travel to and camp in the park A two hour flight to Calgary followed by a 90 minute drive will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe",

    "title": "24 Places for Coloradans And Anyone Else to Travel in 2024",
    "excerpt": "There are places in Colorado in America and overseas that are worth visiting",
    "summary": "From The Denver Post DENVER Every year The New York Times publishes a list titled 52 Places to Go and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming But most of those far flung locales are bucket listers the kinds of destinations that make for a once in a lifetime trip or a special adventure So we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024 but with more manageable goals and with a nod toward Colorado connections We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport because travel is already difficult these days prices crowds cancellations Why make it any harder Here are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year broken down into destinations in Colorado elsewhere in the United States and other countries or overseas This year marks the 25th anniversary of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park Colorado 's fourth and least visited member of the nation 's most prestigious open space club Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways from scenic drives and rim side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes Montrose about five hours from Denver is a popular kickoff point Camp Hale Continental Divide National Monument Designating the 84500 acres where Colorado 's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 did n't change it much The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing snowmobiling and ATV riding But it 's gorgeous country and worth a stay at the campground Want to learn more about it There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind Boulder Boulder does n't really need the attention but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado But the city is more than football and cliches In fact in November Fodor 's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 only one other U.S. destination was included The travel guide honed in on Boulder 's scenery open space and accessibility to recreation and nature as well as the Pearl Street Mall 's dining options We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries as well as a Michelin starred restaurant Frasca Craft Beer Highway The origins of Colorado 's craft beer culture date back to 1979 when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287 between Broomfield and Fort Collins In fact you could call this 50 mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway Wanna get a taste Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures some of which like Liquid Mechanics Cellar West Verboten and Zwei are among the best small breweries in the state Mount Blue Sky It 's not the tallest mountain in Colorado but it 's the closest 14\u2018er to Denver and one of the best known peaks in the state And last September Mount Evans at 14130 feet was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups With the change it 's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado 14'ers that motorists can drive to the top of although not in winter The views up there are gorgeous and there is a good chance you 'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way Glenwood Springs There 's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak 's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon but also the less often seen backside of Denver and its suburbs Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years with big changes already completed or still on their way to some of its hot springs like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs among others The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite a stroll some entertainment and a beer perhaps from Casey Brewing Blending 's lively taproom Amache National Historic Site Wanna get away You do n't need Southwest Airlines Just drive east from the Front Range at any time of year really in the opposite direction of where most people are headed One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site which became part of the National Park System in 2022 Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II Today there is a cemetery a monument and landscaping to explore and to remember Mountain Plover Festival Karval Speaking of eastern Colorado one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April it 's April 26 28 this year in Karval What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different There are no motels or restaurants in Karval so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families meals and entertainment are provided So in addition to bird watching tours mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see you learn about the history and community of the area Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County In The United States Spring Training in Arizona No matter how you feel about baseball Major League Baseball 's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix Tempe Scottsdale area can be a magical experience And as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale it 's also a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s a nice break from cold Colorado weather and there are pools aplenty Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument Arizona Grand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system with nearly 5 million visitors per year but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Joe Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites The national monument is n't that easy to visit since it consists mostly of open space but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest Hatch New Mexico The great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch N.M. an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles Other things to see in the area White Sands Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie and Oscar nominee Oppenheimer Make sure to stop in Pueblo Colo. on your way back up Interstate 25 though that 's the heart of Colorado 's own green chile country so you can settle the debate for yourself Asheville North Carolina DIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville North Caroline in September and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver 's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months Fort Collins founded New Belgium also has a taproom there But Asheville set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway should be on any Coloradan 's list anyway because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene it 's an outdoor lovers mountain playground New York City There 's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium the date is still TBA the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism Feb. 25 to June 28 Plus you can get your fill of ramen pizza bagels

Rachel Woolf Rachel Woolf for NPR He argues that processed food is already subsidized so it 's not a fair fight Jim Krieger executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America says Guttridge is right There 's lots of subsidies for soy and corn they 're key ingredients for ultra processed foods which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables Krieger says Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they 're forced to use them in the local food system but Boulder county is n't taking that approach Instead of sticks they 're using carrots trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown in competition A force for good Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont Colo.

    "excerpt": "The flight to quality trend across the commercial real estate industry has laid bare the differences between the quality of offices in Denver",
    "summary": "Denver has more office space in its development pipeline than its peer cities in the Western U.S. according to a study compiled by the Downtown Seattle Association with roughly 2.3 M SF of office construction underway across the metro area But who will lease Denver 's new office buildings once they are completed is an open question as leasing activity in the Mile High City remains under pressure and historic tenant bases shift Downtown Denver The city 's development pipeline is well ahead of other cities mentioned in the report such as Portland Seattle and Chicago Portland had roughly 525 K SF of office space under development as of fourth quarter 2023 according to data from Colliers Seattle and Chicago had 1.4 M SF and 759 K SF of offices under construction respectively the brokerage found Roughly 700 K SF of office space is under construction downtown according to CBRE the second highest total out of the 16 submarkets CBRE tracks All of the square footage is contained in a single development 1900 Lawrence which is just 4.4 pre leased with about three months left until the building 's projected completion Meanwhile Denver recorded net negative absorption of 80 K SF in Q4 2023 CBRE found In Q4 office tenants inked 1.1 M SF of leases in Denver roughly 6.7 below the activity recorded in Q4 2022 CBRE found Denver leaders are trying to transform the

Community Impact Andrew Iltis That could mean including tenants like the corporate offices of retailers and restaurants as longtime downtown industries like energy and tech slow their leasing activity I think what we 're really putting our energy into right now is bringing those regional and local brands so that we can see people growing their business from the ground up whether they 've started here in Denver or whether they 've started somewhere else and are looking to try out a market Iltis told Bisnow In the years before the pandemic technology companies have driven Denver 's office leasing activity But that began to change in early 2020 as tech companies embraced remote work In turn the share of tech companies leasing office space in Denver declined from around 40 to 16 CBRE Senior Vice President Ryan Link told Bisnow in December Iltis said Denver may not attract large companies like LinkedIn or Google right now but the decrease in tech office leasing has opened the doors for smaller companies in business services insurance and wellness to enter the market For example global consulting firm Bain and Co. leased 39 K SF at 675 15th St. and Booyah Advertising leased 25 K SF at 1700 Lincoln St. according to DDP 's 2023 State of Downtown Denver report Digital ad company Choozle announced last week that it would move its headquarters to downtown Denver as well choosing 1125 17th St. as its new home The company did not disclose the size of its new office Apart from downtown other popular office development spots are River North and Cherry Creek River North has more than 787 K SF under construction with 92 of that captured in three projects according to CBRE 's market report One of the projects is T3 River North a 230 K SF office building at 3500 Blake St. which is already 100 pre leased to Xcel Energy Cherry Creek has more than 350 K SF of office space under construction and is one of Denver 's most competitive submarkets for office space Cherry Creek boasts a 7.5 direct vacancy rate the second lowest in the metro area behind only Longmont and an average asking rent of $ 37.37 per SF $ 4.52 above average for the metro area JLL Managing Director and office landlord broker Jamie Roupp told Bisnow he is targeting tenants that are proactively trying to attract and retain talent particularly those with stated return to office policies Some landlords are also offering enhanced tenant improvements like new flooring or HVAC systems to attract new tenants Roupp added But the flight to quality across the commercial real estate industry has widened the performance gap for many of downtown Denver 's office buildings Roupp said adding that newly constructed buildings that are well located are capturing a disproportionate share of tenant demand Bisnow previously reported that the market for Class A office spaces is tightening in top dollar markets like Miami New York and Chicago as tenants pursue space in the most modern buildings In the short term Roupp said these issues could buoy leasing activity at existing office spaces by delaying the delivery of new construction and controlling the pace of new supply hitting the market Cushman Wakefield 's data suggests that this activity is likely to persist given that Class A office buildings contributed more than two thirds of Denver 's office leasing activity in Q4 or roughly 867.9 K SF of space in all Class B office space made up 28.5 of activity accounting for about 365 K SF The flight to quality has also caused existing tenant requirements and new to market relocations to be either flat or declining Roupp said He noted that this trend could reverse as demand picks up in the market but that remains to be seen",

    "summary": "Powder hounds found the good stuff over the Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend But for many the freshies came at a cost hours and hours and hours of delays on the way home The snow was probably amazing for those who were able to get to the ski areas and then return says Colorado Department of Transportation CDOT spokesperson Elise Thatcher But it 's very important for travelers to factor in not just the great snow at the ski areas but also what the roads are going to be like getting there and back Or in the case of driving conditions over the long weekend what the parking lot conditions will be like because that 's precisely what the highways became Turns out when you pair accumulation that reached upward of 60 inches on some of the state 's higher mountain passes with an intense rate of snowfall that peaked at around two inches an hour at times you get a hellish driving environment Blowing wind low visibility icy asphalt near whiteout conditions and heavy holiday traffic all contributed to safety closures on multiple Summit County passes Cameron Pass and you guessed it I-70 eastbound on both sides of the Eisenhower Johnson Memorial Tunnel Jackknifed trucks and stalled out two wheel drive cars created a Frogger like driving experience when traffic was actually moving When it was n't roadsides turned into rather drafty bathrooms as stuck skiers did what they had to Then there was Berthoud Pass which was shut down by Mother Nature before CDOT had the chance Snow slides along almost its entire length swallowed up 10 cars no injuries were reported and led to a four day closure on that section of U.S. 40 Yet another factor contributing to the chaos the paltry powder so far this season When you have the weather plus a long weekend plus not much previous snow people are itching to enjoy it says Alejandro Brown who 's been monitoring the closures and resulting shenanigans on I-70 since 2019 with his Instagram account @i70things He estimates that during the MLK Day weekend he received about five times the amount of content that he would on a typical winter weekend I do n't have notifications on my phone but if I did it would have just been nonstop His solution for mitigating the traffic madness Simple Follow the traction rules It 's a few bad apples he says What could have been their four hour commute turns into eight or 10 hours and now everyone is frustrated and upset and grumpy As for skiers they have their own solutions borne out of firsthand experience from that weekend 's snowpocalypse which they share below Editor 's note These interviews have been edited for length and clarity Judd and Nicole Nutting Time in Colorado Judd 30 years Nicole 18 years Personal hell Eight hours to get from Winter Park to Longmont Judd We pulled our three kids out of school an hour early on Friday to drive up to my family 's house in Winter Park for the long weekend Of course there was no traffic It was barely snowing on Berthoud Pass We did n't wake up to much snow on Saturday so we thought Oh maybe this snowstorm is n't going to happen Sunday we woke up and had 10 inches Then we found out there was an avalanche on the pass that buried 10 cars Nicole We got 16 inches Monday morning and there was this camaraderie on the lifts Everybody at the resort had been there a few days and was thinking Well I 'm not going anywhere right now so I might as well ski One of our friends kept saying This is a unicorn day This is amazing But there were also conversations about how you were going to get home and where you would stay if you could n't Judd Monday night we decided to wake up Tuesday and go the long way home through Kremmling and Silverthorne to I-70 Apparently everyone else stranded in Winter Park and Steamboat was thinking the exact same thing that we were Tuesday is a sunny day Temps are warmer Let 's go Nicole We finally stopped for lunch around noon at the first gas station on the edge of Silverthorne Full sections were empty of food The bathroom line was out the door Back in the car we spent two hours going two miles through town When we finally got on I-70 the pass up to the Eisenhower Tunnel had numerous cars stalled because the conditions were so slushy We saw a tow truck pushing a trailer which was pushing a truck up the pass Judd Once we got through the tunnel it was smooth sailing in part because Berthoud Pass was closed and there was no additional traffic from U.S. 40 We were lucky that we had a place to stay while we were stranded and we got a great ski day out of it But if you 're asking if the skiing was worth the eight hour drive with three kids Still not sure Our Proposal for Making it Better In Silverthorne the freeway was moving pretty fast but the lights in town were n't getting the cars through efficiently There needed to be something or someone to override the lights Rachael Scala Welch Time in Colorado 10 years Personal hell 33 hours to get from Steamboat Springs to Nederland Rachael Scala Welch 's ETA to her home in Ned over MLK weekend Photo courtesy of Rachael Scala Welch Our hope was to take Cameron Pass back from Steamboat Monday morning so we could do some backcountry skiing but that was thwarted because CO 14 was closed Plan B was to take Berthoud Pass but that was also closed We had our camper so we overnighted in Hot Sulphur Springs and soaked Tuesday morning to wait out traffic It was beautiful until we saw that the only way to get back home was via I-70 That meant going through the Silverthorne Summit County Eisenhower Tunnel disaster that we were trying to avoid the whole time I 've never seen anything that hectic We walked around Lake Dillon while watching traffic but realized there was really no other option besides staying another night And even if we had there was nowhere to stay We ended up getting home Tuesday at 5:30 p.m. After this experience I 've vowed to backcountry tour only and to stay local for the next holiday weekend during ski season My Proposal for Making it Better MLK weekend highlighted the need for rapid renewable energy powered mass transit from the Front Range to the mountains That would make travel safer better for the environment and it would make visiting and living at our beloved mountain destinations easier In the meantime we can carpool and ask our employers for opportunities to ski during the week Lauryn Stasiak waits in line at Vail on MLK weekend Photo by Lauryn Stasiak Time in Colorado Three years Personal hell Eight hours to get from Vail to Arvada Since I 'm a teacher I usually ca n't get work off to go ski so I typically ski on the weekends I was planning on going that Sunday and we heard that Vail was getting two inches of snow the night before It took us a little bit longer than normal to get there but traffic was n't bad And the snow was insane Like it was two feet of powder At 2:45 p.m. we thought Let 's go beat the traffic When we got to our car we saw that Vail Pass was closed We did n't hear anything about the tunnel being closed so we drove down to Leadville to get to Copper and had about an hour of delays Once we got back onto I-70 it was open roads and we thought Sweet We 're good Then we pulled up to Silverthorne That 's when we just saw red red red red red on the map and tail lights for what seemed like the next million and a half miles Google Maps said that the traffic to the tunnel was an hour and 27 minutes and we thought we could sit there for that If we had known we were going to be in the traffic from Silverthorne to the tunnel for five hours we would have pulled over It was the worst traffic of my life My Proposal for Making it Better I had no service on my phone because there were thousands of people sitting in that traffic using the phone towers They need more cell towers And food trucks on the side of the highway 4 Tips for Avoiding I-70 Ski Traffic Heading into the mountains Be prepared ahead of time",

Boulder Colo. she 's put together bright pink and purple radishes apple fresh turnips This is a green luobo she explains as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences so they could rotate their livestock As the sheep graze they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops Image Rachel Woolf for NPR These locally grown vegetables are n't just pretty They 're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting and everybody can get on the same vibration eating the same good healthy food says Cordero 's dad Mark Guttridge who started this farm with his wife Kena 17 years ago That vibration and the good healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers two state representatives and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level Healthy soil to healthy population Before the meeting Guttridge shows me one of those investments A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence The animals which Guttridge raises for wool munch on radishes that have been leftover for them And as they eat they poop So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field Guttridge laughs They 'll be out here a couple more weeks and then it 'll sit for about four or five months And then we 'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there Around the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another fertilizing as they go He 's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep do n't graze on The goal of these investments is really building up our soil health he explains That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food healthy soil grows healthy food The county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health That 's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in It created a coupon program that low income families many of mixed immigration status can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms farm stand It 's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand new people new families Guttridge says We 're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food but they also hang out and learn He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming and how tasty its produce can be Win win win Nutrition incentive programs like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons are spreading all over the country and most are funded through the federal farm bill A purple daikon radish grown at Ollin Farms in Longmont Colo. and other vegetables are prepared to be served at a meeting to discuss support for small Colorado farmers in December Image Rachel Woolf for NPR Amy Lazarus Yaroch executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support It 's a triple win she explains It 's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they 're getting the healthy food it 's good for the farmer and then it 's good for the economy she explains Then again these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that 's grown locally Guttridge says that it 's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons He argues that processed food is already subsidized so it 's not a fair fight Jim Krieger executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America says Guttridge is right There 's lots of subsidies for soy and corn they 're key ingredients for ultra processed foods which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables Krieger says Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they 're forced to use them in the local food system but Boulder county is n't taking that approach Instead of sticks they 're using carrots trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown in competition MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer 's Markets Image Rachel Woolf for NPR A force for good Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont Colo. Boulder County Farmer 's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery Mackenzie Sehlke the organization 's executive director pulls open the door of a walk in refrigerator A lot of storage crops in here right now she says Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community We have a large Nepalese community here she says So we 're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population Jimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge 's daughter She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability Image Rachel Woolf for NPR Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow she says I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here she says Yes she acknowledges there are plenty of big structural problems with America 's food system but she 's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people Mark Guttridge and his daughter Jimena Cordero at Ollin Farm in Longmont Colo. Image Rachel Woolf for NPR I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool she says And I 've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently Policy can be a force for good she says to forge connections between farmer market and hungry resident so it 's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food Copyright 2024 NPR To see more visit https://www.npr.org Missing some content Care to comment Check the source NPR Copyright(c 2024 NPR",

behind Boulder Boulder does n't really need the attention but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado But the city is more than football and cliches In fact in November Fodor 's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 only one other U.S. destination was included The travel guide honed in on Boulder 's scenery open space and accessibility to recreation and nature as well as the Pearl Street Mall 's dining options We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries as well as a Michelin starred restaurant Frasca Craft beer highway The origins of Colorado 's craft beer culture date back to 1979 when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287 between Broomfield and Fort Collins In fact you could call this 50 mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway Wanna get a taste Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures some of which like Liquid Mechanics Cellar West Verboten and Zwei are among the best small breweries in the state Mount Blue Sky It 's not the tallest mountain in Colorado but it 's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best known peaks in the state And last September Mount Evans at 14130 feet was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups With the change it 's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of although not in winter The views up there are gorgeous and there is a good chance you 'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way Glenwood Springs There 's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak 's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon but also the less often seen backside of Denver and its suburbs Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years with big changes already completed or still on their way to some of its hot springs like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs among others The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite a stroll some entertainment and a beer perhaps from Casey Brewing Blending 's lively taproom Amache National Historic Site Wanna get away You do n't need Southwest Airlines Just drive east from the Front Range at any time of year really in the opposite direction of where most people are headed One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site which became part of the National Park System in 2022 Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II Today there is a cemetery a monument and landscaping to explore and to remember Mountain Plover Festival Karval Speaking of eastern Colorado one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April it 's April 26 28 this year in Karval What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different There are no motels or restaurants in Karval so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families meals and entertainment are provided So in addition to bird watching tours mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see you learn about the history and community of the area Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County IN THE UNITED STATES Spring training in Arizona No matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball 's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix Tempe Scottsdale area can be a magical experience And as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale it 's also a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s a nice break from cold Colorado weather and there are pools aplenty Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument Arizona Grand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system with nearly 5 million visitors per year but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites The national monument is n't that easy to visit since it consists mostly of open space but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest Hatch N.M. The great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch N.M. an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles Other things to see in the area White Sands Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie and Oscar nominee Oppenheimer Make sure to stop in Pueblo Colo. on your way back up Interstate 25 though that 's the heart of Colorado 's own green chile country so youi can settle the debate for yourself Asheville N.C. DIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville N.C. in September and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver 's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months Fort Collins founded New Belgium also has a taproom there But Asheville set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway should be on any Coloradan 's list anyway because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene it 's an outdoor lovers mountain playground New York City There 's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium the date is still TBA the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism Feb. 25 June 28 Plus you can get your fill of ramen pizza bagels and dumplings which is always a reason for joy Cleveland Ah the Land A city on the comeback Cleveland is a shortish trip by air and in 2024 it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse or the path of totality which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8 Why Cleveland Well there is a small and lesser known national park just 30 minutes away called Cuyahoga Valley which will be celebrating And while you 're in the vicinity take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day The mountains here are stunning certainly but let 's face it Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii 's major islands but and Hapuna Beach might be the most beautiful of them all Expansive warm and a great place to snorkel Hapuna is truly mesmerizing But do n't stop there In addition to Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines the Big Island also boasts white sand green sand and black sand beaches Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa a visit here is the cure to cabin fever OVERSEAS Paris Maybe it does n't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest busiest most congested time of the year Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need Either way there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26 Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years and if the Olympics are n't your thing then consider this Notre Dame Cathedral which nearly burned down in 2019 is set to reopen in December 2024 Dublin For being the sixth busiest airport in the entire world DIA does n't have many direct nonstop international flights So it 's worth celebrating each and every new one In May Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin Ireland 's lively capital city The historic sites here go back more than 1000 years and you can and should tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside including the Cliffs of Moher Giant 's Causeway and Killarney National Park Iceland Also on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland with its waterfalls blue lagoons and adorable puffins The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland Tokyo Japan 's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver and it 's worth the trip The city is like no other place in the world and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood It 's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining recreation or just people watching There 's also craft beer whiskey manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers Jamaica Last February Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay Jamaica cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day with a stopover as we wrote in a travel guide to the country 's tourist capital So for laid back beach bars sizzling jerk chicken swimming holes and of course music this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean Puerto Rico Not to be outdone United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan Puerto Rico in October slashing travel time to the island by several hours Even better you do n't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters plantains and tropical rum drinks however Read more about this sunny destination along with its beaches rainforests history and culture in our recent travel guide Mexico City Mexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade with several neighborhoods teeming with art culture and cuisine Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas churros or cute coffee shops catching the spectacle of lucha libre visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia and trying chapuline with your mezcal Oh and at 7200 feet in altitude it 's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver so you should feel right at home Costa Rica The pura vida never goes out of style but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America but this is one of them Whether you want wildlife scenery great coffee rainforests beaches or culture Costa Rica offers one of the easiest most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation Banff National Park To get some perspective on Colorado 's rocky peaks take a bucket list trip to Canada 's Banff National Park where the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just do n't see in Colorado And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green according to The Denver Post 's extensive travel guide on how to travel to and camp in the park A two hour flight to Calgary followed by a 90 minute drive will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe",

    "summary": "Dear Amy Over the last three years my husband and I have enjoyed several camping and mountain biking trips with another couple Ruth the woman of the couple works with my husband I thought we had a good time as a foursome Very few other women will rough it in the wilderness like we four do A few weeks ago Ruth approached my husband and explained that they 'd been avoiding more trips for the past year as they did n't think I enjoyed the trips I emailed them to offer reassurance that I do enjoy the trips and our friendship and asked them to join me for dinner to discuss this while I was home alone for a week my husband was traveling They shut me down for any in person interactions saying that I project my unhappiness onto them that they walk on eggshells around me that I caused multiple instances of tension and because of my impacts they would remain intentionally unavailable Amy I was completely shocked I had no idea they felt this way They put on a good mask for years These people I thought were close friends shoved me aside by email If they had been honest about the tension they felt I might have been able to change my behavior or at least understand what was bothering them Instead I am confused grieving a friendship and just really hurt They acted like nice people so this came as a shock I am now questioning whether many other friends dislike spending time with me and are walking on eggshells I feel social anxiety building in me What can I do to move on and feel better about myself Broken Eggshells Dear Broken The one person you 've left out of your narrative is your husband He is in the best position to gauge your behavior as well as others reactions to you on these trips You might have a blunt communication style that other people interpret as anger or tension Instead of accepting adjusting to or rolling with your bluntness they try to avoid it by walking on eggshells Your choice to contact the couple and attempt to confront this issue personally in order to clear the air is one sign of your approach to problems While to me this seems honest forthright and fearless this other couple seem to see your approach as aggressive negative or even hostile This current challenge presents opportunities for you to gain insight into your own behavior and its impact on others I suggest that you adopt an attitude of open inquiry regarding your own behavior by surveying people who know you best and love you the most Your husband and siblings if you have them should be able to offer you honest feedback about your interactions After taking a clear eyed look at your own behavior and making changes if need be you then have the right to judge this other couple as being disingenuous Dear Amy I 'm a woman working as a nurse in a busy hospital I have a younger colleague who at this point has a weekend shift Two or three times a month he asks me to change shifts with him Sometimes I say yes but most of the time I say no Last weekend as usual he asked me to switch shifts with him but I told him that I had family obligations over the weekend and could n't do that He got really upset with me and said he was going to go to our supervisor He did and our supervisor sided with me He now refuses to speak to me I feel bad about it and I 'm wondering if I 'm doing the right thing Tired in the ER Dear Tired Your supervisor stood up for your right and duty to work the shifts you 've been assigned This person likely assigns shifts for specific reasons aside from availability Your co worker was arrogant enough to take this issue to your supervisor At this point you might be relieved that he wo n't speak to you but if this avoidance interferes with your ability to provide good patient care your supervisor should again be told | Ask Amy Single woman has radar for dating jerks Ask Amy Single woman has radar for dating jerks | Ask Amy Facebook romance worries wife Ask Amy Facebook romance worries wife | Ask Amy Married couple ponders parenthood Ask Amy Married couple ponders parenthood | Ask Amy Blended family is not really blended Ask Amy Blended family is not really blended | Ask Amy Sudden loss leads to other losses Dear Amy I enjoyed the question from Tired who wondered how to get guests to leave at the end of an evening My grandfather had a saying that he would invoke when he got tired He would say Let 's go to bed now so these nice people can go home Lisa Dear Lisa Beautiful You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy P.O.

    "summary": "Dear Amy Recently an out of state couple moved into our neighborhood due to being transferred by their workplaces These people are charming but the problem is that they smoke Their clothes their house and their cars smell like cigarettes The smell makes me nauseous The state we live in is basically a non smoking state You can not even smoke on most beaches We invited this couple to our annual outdoor holiday party I dug out the Please no smoking signs I had stored away and placed them in the outside planters When they arrived they immediately lit up We greeted them and I politely pointed out the signs They apologized and put out their cigarettes in the planters when they were n't looking I removed the butts Within 10 minutes they left and smoked on the sidewalk next to our backyard The noxious smell carried into our party and clung to them when they returned Some guests commented about cigarettes because it is a rare smell these days They are planning a dinner at their home to thank us for the invitation We suggested a restaurant but the wife wants to cook a special meal for us and a few of the other neighbors As much as I like them their smoking habit makes me literally sick and I do not want to pursue this friendship because of this habit My husband agrees because the smell gives him a headache How do we decline Right now we 're stalling Do we explain that cigarette smoke makes us ill Reluctant Neighbor Dear Reluctant If these people had cats and you were allergic to dander you would let them know Many states ban smoking in any public place even on sidewalks If contact with the noxious residual smell of cigarette smoking makes you ill then you owe it to yourself to guard your own health It is your responsibility to protect your own health and wellness So yes you should tell these neighbors that unfortunately exposure to any smoke or the residual smell of cigarette smoke aggravates your allergies and makes you both ill so you assume it would be an issue for you to spend time inside their house Dear Amy A few close co workers including me recently attended a destination wedding of a colleague and friend Our department leader was also invited and attended Everything went well and a nice time was had by all Fast forward to today and our department leader now wants to have quarterly get togethers for the group that attended the wedding I have hesitations about this for a few reasons First if word gets out about this exclusive outing others on the team will feel like we 're getting preferential treatment which I definitely understand Second while the leader said anyone is welcome to come I feel like this will seem more like an obligation outside of work that you ca n't say no to My colleagues and I are unsure how to bring these concerns up without causing hurt feelings What should we do Troubled Team Dear Troubled You have valid concerns about these outings I agree that gathering some members of the team for scheduled outings is not a good idea and anyone is welcome to come is quite different from all team members are invited and included You might assume that this idea grew out of that unique sort of post party glow when the hangover fades but the good feelings linger and that given some time to consider the professional ramifications in terms of team morale your fearless leader might reconsider this idea and let it quietly go away I 'm not sure how it would cause hurt feelings for you and other team members to react to this idea by bringing up the professional challenges it might cause as well as the unexpressed pressure that is exerted when a boss plans team outings Are these gatherings compulsory Will people who ca n't attend because of other obligations or because they do n't want to miss out on intangibles important to professional success | Ask Amy Parents ponder son 's athletic ability Ask Amy Parents ponder son 's athletic ability | Ask Amy A messy affair reveals Daddy issues Ask Amy A messy affair reveals Daddy issues | Ask Amy Miserable wife contemplates next steps Ask Amy Miserable wife contemplates next steps | Ask Amy Assault survivor wants to keep trauma private Ask Amy Assault survivor wants to keep trauma private | Ask Amy Grandson 's clothing ca n't travel between homes Dear Amy No Messy Feelings Allowed was frustrated because when she shared her messier feelings with her friend the friend jumped in with lots of solutions The question my family and I ask when someone shares a problem is Do you want to be helped heard or hugged Works like a charm Ann Dear Ann I 've had a lot of responses to this question which brings up the issue of offering and receiving unsolicited advice I really appreciate your approach You can email Amy Dickinson at askamy@amydickinson.com or send a letter to Ask Amy P.O.

the kinds of destinations that make for a once in a lifetime trip or a special adventure So we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024 but with more manageable goals and with a nod toward Colorado connections We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport because travel is already difficult these days prices crowds cancellations Why make it any harder Here are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year broken down into destinations in Colorado elsewhere in the United States and other countries or overseas Bon voyage IN COLORADO This year marks the 25th anniversary of Colorado 's fourth and least visited member of the nation 's most prestigious open space club Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways from scenic drives and rim side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or

Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 did n't change it much The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing snowmobiling and ATV riding But it 's gorgeous country and worth a stay at the campground Want to learn more about it There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind Boulder Boulder does n't really need the attention but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado But the city is more than football and cliches In fact in November Fodor 's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 only one other U.S. destination was included The travel guide honed in on Boulder 's scenery open space and accessibility to recreation and nature as well as the Pearl Street Mall 's dining options We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries as well as a Michelin starred restaurant Frasca Craft beer highway The origins of Colorado 's craft beer culture date back to 1979 when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287 between Broomfield and Fort Collins In fact you could call this 50 mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway Wanna get a taste Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures some of which like Liquid Mechanics Cellar West Verboten and Zwei are among the best small breweries in the state Mount Blue Sky It 's not the tallest mountain in Colorado but it 's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best known peaks in the state And last September Mount Evans at 14130 feet was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups With the change it 's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of although not in winter The views up there are gorgeous and there is a good chance you 'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way Glenwood Springs There 's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak 's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon but also the less often seen backside of Denver and its suburbs Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years with big changes already completed or still on their way to some of its hot springs like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs among others The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite a stroll some entertainment and a beer perhaps from Casey Brewing Blending 's lively taproom Amache National Historic Site Wanna get away You do n't need Southwest Airlines Just drive east from the Front Range at any time of year really in the opposite direction of where most people are headed One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site which became part of the National Park System in 2022 Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II Today there is a cemetery a monument and landscaping to explore and to remember Mountain Plover Festival Karval Speaking of eastern Colorado one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April it 's April 26 28 this year in Karval What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different There are no motels or restaurants in Karval so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families meals and entertainment are provided So in addition to bird watching tours mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see you learn about the history and community of the area Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County IN THE UNITED STATES Spring training in Arizona No matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies Major League Baseball 's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix Tempe Scottsdale area can be a magical experience And as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale it 's also a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s a nice break from cold Colorado weather and there are pools aplenty Baaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument Arizona Grand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system with nearly 5 million visitors per year but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites The national monument is n't that easy to visit since it consists mostly of open space but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest Hatch N.M.

DIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville N.C. in September and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver 's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months Fort Collins founded New Belgium also has a taproom there But Asheville set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway should be on any Coloradan 's list anyway because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene it 's an outdoor lovers mountain playground New York City There 's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium the date is still TBA the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism Feb. 25 June 28 Plus you can get your fill of ramen pizza bagels and dumplings which is always a reason for joy Cleveland Ah the Land A city on the comeback Cleveland is a shortish trip by air and in 2024 it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse or the path of totality which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8 Why Cleveland Well there is a small and lesser known national park just 30 minutes away called Cuyahoga Valley which will be celebrating And while you 're in the vicinity take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day The mountains here are stunning certainly but let 's face it Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii 's major islands but and Hapuna Beach might be the most beautiful of them all Expansive warm and a great place to snorkel Hapuna is truly mesmerizing But do n't stop there In addition to Hawai\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines the Big Island also boasts white sand green sand and black sand beaches Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa a visit here is the cure to cabin fever OVERSEAS Paris Maybe it does n't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest busiest most congested time of the year Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need Either way there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26 Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years and if the Olympics are n't your thing then consider this Notre Dame Cathedral which nearly burned down in 2019 is set to reopen in December 2024 Dublin For being the sixth busiest airport in the entire world DIA does n't have many direct nonstop international flights So it 's worth celebrating each and every new one In May Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin Ireland 's lively capital city The historic sites here go back more than 1000 years and you can and should tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside including the Cliffs of Moher Giant 's Causeway and Killarney National Park Iceland Also on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland with its waterfalls blue lagoons and adorable puffins The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland Tokyo Japan 's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver and it 's worth the trip The city is like no other place in the world and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood It 's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining recreation or just people watching There 's also craft beer whiskey manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers Jamaica Last February Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay Jamaica cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day with a stopover as we wrote in a travel guide to the country 's tourist capital So for laid back beach bars sizzling jerk chicken swimming holes and of course music this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean Puerto Rico Not to be outdone United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan Puerto Rico in October slashing travel time to the island by several hours Even better you do n't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters plantains and tropical rum drinks however Read more about this sunny destination along with its beaches rainforests history and culture in our recent travel guide Mexico City Mexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade with several neighborhoods teeming with art culture and cuisine Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas churros or cute coffee shops catching the spectacle of lucha libre visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia and trying chapuline with your mezcal Oh and at 7200 feet in altitude it 's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver so you should feel right at home Costa Rica The pura vida never goes out of style but Costa Rica

    "excerpt": "Those looking for hopeful signs for 2024 need look no further than the dynamism evident across the grain based foods industry",
    "summary": "KANSAS CITY Anyone monitoring the grain based foods sector 's financial results and listening to the evolving narratives of industry executives at publicly traded companies knows the past year was difficult for the industry For many of the sector 's companies the operating environment failed to develop in 2023 in ways conducive to sales and earnings growth chief executive officers had guided investors to anticipate With the trimming of guidance at many companies repeatedly in certain cases the poor performance of grain based foods share prices should not have been surprising The share price weakness still managed to deliver a jolt Declines in Milling Baking News Grain Based Foods GBF Share Index have been a rarity over the last 15 years Before 2023 the index was higher for 13 of the previous 14 years The period included eight consecutive years of gains after a 22 drop in 2008 Josh Sosland editor of Milling Baking News Source Sosland Publishing Co. Giving the 2023 performance an especially negative look was not the absolute decline of 6.5 only a moderate setback It was the underperformance of the GBF index relative to broader market indexes the worst in 20 years Compared to the S&P 500 index grain based foods shares lagged by 30.7 percentage points Relative to the NASDAQ index the deficit was even greater 49.5 percentage points Some comfort may be taken in the fact the S&P 500 's surge in 2023 was driven by a relatively small number of companies and 72 of the stocks in the index failed to achieve the benchmark 's gain of 24 Still that statistic implies that more than one in four companies in the S&P 500 beat the index last year Among the GBF shares not a single company beat the S&P 500 last year or even came close The top performing stock in the index gained 12 only half what the overall S&P 500 gained in 2023 Despite the year 's many negatives perspective on what transpired last year paints a less dire picture and implies positive notes for what to expect in 2024 To begin the sharp underperformance of grain based foods shares last year represented a reversal from the year before when the GBF index beat the S&P 500 by about 27 points Food companies are not impervious to market volatility Targeting low single digit sales growth each year and mid single digit operating profit growth the food sector is not positioned to generate double digit share price gains year after year Instead of an indictment on the grain based foods industry and its prospects the underperformance last year for the most part has been characterized as a sector rotation within the investment community Just as rising interest rates prompted investors to seek shelter in the safety of food stocks in 2022 optimism that interest rates had or had nearly peaked triggered a shift by investors to growthier tech oriented companies Those looking for hopeful signs for 2024 need look no further than the dynamism evident across the grain based foods industry In the bread segment for example the success of numerous products currently trending positively was apparent in capital investments acquisitions announced over the last couple years Examples include a new plant to be built by King 's Hawaiian in Indiana to deal with what the company called capacity constraints the expansion of the J.M. Smucker Co. Longmont Colo. Uncrustables plant and Bimbo 's acquisition in late 2022 of St Pierre Group the baker of brioche style products Also cause for optimism were two major transactions completed over the past year aimed at accelerating growth the spinoff of Kellogg Co. into Kellanova and WK Kellogg Co and the Smucker acquisition of Hostess Brands Meanwhile food beverage and processing companies go into 2024 with far more attractive relative valuation than was the case in January 2023 Despite last year 's difficulties there is cause for optimism in the new year",

    "summary": "On Tuesday night LGBTQ advocates gathered at Town Hall Collaborative a Denver community space and bar for the Legislative Kickoff of One Colorado the state 's leading organization for LGBTQ rights Bridges We do n't want to be reactive anymore we have to be proactive said Nadine Bridges Executive Director of One Colorado during the event Right now in 2024 and we 're not even at the end of January we have over 329 anti LGBTQ bills according to the ACLU Bridges said It is unbelievable Right here in the state of Colorado we have 12 anti LGBTQ initiatives happening eight parental rights and four anti trans sports initiatives Titone State Rep. Brianna Titone D Arvada spoke of her own sense of fatigue as hundreds of similar bills have been introduced each year since 2020 In 2023 alone 510 anti LGBTQ bills were introduced across the country shattering the record set by 2022 2024 seems likely to follow that trend I look at the news I follow Erin Reed Titone said referencing trans journalist Erin Reed 's project to track all anti LGBTQ legislation across the country She is always telling us about all the anti trans stuff and you know we 're lucky that we have her to keep track of all this stuff and listen to all the hearings to tell us all the things that are happening Because it 's hard listening to all those things happening all the time One upcoming attack on LGBTQ liberties may be coming directly from the Colorado Republican Party Earlier this month Darcy Schoening formerly a co chair of the El Paso County Moms for Liberty chapter announced she had joined the state GOP as Director of Special Initiatives and that the party would run a ballot initiative to ban gender affirming care for minors in Colorado Schoening also mentioned that the initiative was backed by Matt Walsh a national far right pundit known primarily for his inflammatory stances on LGBTQ people Screenshot of Darcy Schoening discussing a ballot initiative to ban gender reassignment medical procedures All of us and everyone looking online here make sure that you are doing your part Titone continued That 's something we can all do I 'm not going to see all those people peddling those petitions but we all can keep an eye out for them and when we find those bad petitions out there and call them out for what they are and let people know That 's a bad petition do n't sign it Each speaker talked at length about plans to advance LGBTQ rights in Colorado during the 2024 session and beyond Bridges referenced U.S. Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas statement made following the fall of Roe v. Wade in 2022 that the same precedent could be used to take down Obergefell v. Hodges which guarantees marriage equality for same sex couples While Colorado leans strongly blue now that was n't always the case and an older amendment could jeopardize some gay marriages in the state if Obergefell falls In the state of Colorado we have Amendment 43 Bridges explained to the audience Amendment 43 basically says that marriage is between one man and one woman If Obergefell falls what would happen is that in this state marriage would no longer be legal for same sex marriages If you are already married because of the Respect for Marriage Act you can stay married but if you are not married there 's a whole lot of issues Bridges referenced a potential ballot measure by One Colorado currently in the works for 2024 that could rectify this More potential legislation for 2024 was discussed Titone mentioned that state Rep. Lorena Garcia D Westminster was working on a bill that would allow trans people with felonies to have their legal names changed as well as another bill by herself and Stephanie Vigil D Colorado Springs providing for non legal name changes for students in Colorado schools If Elon Musk just changed the name of the company that he bought he wants everybody to call it that Titone quipped It 's not Twitter now we have to call it X because that 's the right thing to do Titone said Vigil was also introducing a bill to hold a study on gender affirming care in Colorado concerning both longtime residents and those who fled to Colorado following the passage of anti trans bills in their own states Velasco Elizabeth Velasco D Glenwood Springs spoke to the crowd on an intersectional awareness of how issues like pollution and the current migrant crisis impacting Denver also impact the LGBTQ community Velasco also teased two bills one that would allow students more freedom in what they wear during their graduation ceremonies and another that would streamline the state 's migrant crisis response to be more like the process for asylum seekers I 've been fighting for access to clean air and clean water for all and we know that that 's an LGBTQ issue I 'm also the co chair of the Latino caucus and we have been very involved with the response to the migrant crisis And we know that that 's an LGBTQ issue We have to realize that all our issues are intersectional and we have to show up for each other Members of the state Legislature 's LGBTQ caucus in attendance included state Reps Titone Velasco Vigil Jennifer Parenti D Longmont and state Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis D Lafayette Also attending though not themselves part of the LGBTQ caucus were state Reps Bob Marshall D Highlands Ranch Meghan Lukens D Eagle and Tim Hernandez D Denver The event was streamed on Instagram and can be viewed here",

    "summary": "When Longmont resident Katrina Miller moved to Boulder in the early 2000s she was excited to start a new chapter in her life She had enrolled at the University of Colorado Boulder and was ready to pursue her education The thing she had not prepared for was being one of the few Black people on campus The experience shared by many other people of color inspired her and her cohorts to understand the lack of diversity in Boulder County by making the film This is Not Who We Are The film premiered in 2022 at the Boulder International Film Festival The documentary was co produced and directed by Miller and Beret Strong with editing by John Tweedy It explores the gap between Boulder 's self image and the more complex lived experiences both historical and contemporary of its Black citizens according to the film 's synopsis We are all long time Boulder residents We all went to CU And living in this community for the white members of my film team they noticed that the community is n't as diverse as they would like the Boulder County community to be Miller said We began this project almost exactly three years ago just before Boulder police profiled Naropa student Zayd Atkinson said Strong a white filmmaker and long time Boulder resident I realized I knew very little about Boulder 's Black community And though I have made films set in Micronesia Latin America and Africa I had never made a film that addressed issues in my hometown Atkinson was picking up trash around his dorm as part of his work study job when police approached him Six officers surrounded Atkinson because they did n't believe he belonged there Wanting to see a difference the team began researching what it is that keeps Boulder County from inviting in more diverse backgrounds of people Miller lent her own lived experience to the project When Miller attended CU Boulder in the early 2000s it was ranked as the second whitest university in the nation she said Issues of inequity and systemic racism became more prevalent and more prominent and just so more easily to notice when I moved here where I did n't really notice it before Miller said The hope in making this film was to bring awareness to the fact that there is still inequity going on in Boulder We need to shatter this myth that Boulder is so progressive and liberal and that it is doing everything right in those areas because there is still work to do Atkinson 's experience is only one of many stories shared in This is Not Who We Are Miller said the film crew approached Black community members throughout Boulder County to share their own lived experiences It feels like everybody has a story In listening to these stories it makes the film more accessible I believe because it 's hard to deny someone 's actual lived experience Miller said A little girl was talking about her fear at school You ca n't deny her her fear because that is something that is actually happening So to have the audience see some of a variety of what people of color go through here was really the method of explaining what is going on in Boulder The film also takes a look at 150 years of local history and how that set the tone for the racial climate in Boulder County Miller said the film has had an excellent impact on the community It has been used in schools museums and other venues to talk about racial concepts such as equity oppression and true allyship The film has been widely accepted and screened in Boulder but has been left out of the conversation in Longmont although the film team all reside in Longmont now The Light of Christ EEC located at 1000 15th Ave in Longmont will host a screening of the movie on Feb. 10 at 2 p.m. Another screening will shown at Front Range Community College Boulder County Campus on Feb. 22 in the Community Room at noon",

Mattis Ave We 're already experiencing staffing shortages and if our mail is sent up to Chicago for processing it 's only going to delay the mail further Bridges who does not represent the post office or the local chapter of the American Postal Workers Union said that a coalition of workers and people from local community groups organized the meeting to raise awareness about an upcoming public hearing that is part of the review process During the Sunday event the IMC 's Gus Wood will deliver a presentation on the history and relevance of the Postal Service and the president of the local union chapter will also be present she said According to a notice from the Postal Service community members can submit comments regarding the Mattis Avenue facility at survey- monkey.com/r/mpfr champaign il If the facility review supports the business case for change to the facility 's processing operations USPS will hold a public meeting to allow members of the local community to provide additional feedback officials wrote A summary of the review will be posted on about.usps.com at least one week prior to the public input meeting A list of facilities undergoing reviews along with related documents such as initial findings and public meeting notices is available at about.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/mpfr/welcome.htm The Postal Service has yet to post a notice for a public meeting for the northwest Champaign post office According to its notice about the review the Postal Service plans to consider whether efficiency could be enhanced by transferring some of the mail processing operations performed at the Champaign facility to similar facilities in Chicago and its south suburbs Additionally officials said that if they decide to move some mail processing operations away from the Champaign facility it is highly likely that it will be modernized and repurposed as a Local Processing Center a Sorting and Delivery Center or both consistent with the broader network redesign Local Processing Centers are critical nodes in the Postal Service 's end to end network model the agency said providing a connection between Regional Processing and Distribution Centers and Sorting and Delivery Centers Within a region S&DCs will expand our network reach officials added saying they will aggregate delivery units into fewer larger and centrally located sites to provide faster and more reliable mail and package delivery over a greater geographic area as compared to traditional delivery units Bridges claimed that many local postal workers will be displaced if the local facility becomes a Local Processing Center or a Sorting and Delivery Center If we lose our outgoing mail to Chicago many of our sorting machines will be dismantled she said Many of our techs clerks and mail handlers will have to move to other cities to keep their jobs or else be forced out of their chosen craft into other roles The Postal Service has stated that the review will not result in the facility 's closure or career employee layoffs When asked what the term career employee means Bridges explained that there is a two tier system for Postal Service employees with newer employees being part of a lower tier She estimated that this lasts for about a year and a half to two years I do n't think that the people at the lower tier have any job security she said She added that the consolidation of carriers into Sorting and Delivery Centers will mean that instead of a semitrailer delivering presorted mail from the Mattis Avenue facility to other post offices in the area letter carriers will have to drive up to an hour to get their mail from the Sorting and Delivery Center then return to their routes to deliver it This will mean that either they will have to make two round trips each day or they will have to leave the mail they 've collected sitting overnight at the local post office until they come back the next day she said Either way it will most certainly delay the mail by an extra day At the national level the postal workers union has expressed similar concerns about the agency 's changes slowing down mail delivery Bridges also fears that the consolidation of pick up and drop off points at Sorting and Delivery Centers could lead to reduced operating hours at rural post offices and a possible escalation of local post office closures",

    "excerpt": "The Attorney General should not only be aggressive in protecting taxpayers but that should also expand to fighting public corruption Illinois Attorney General candidate Steve Kim writes in his",
    "summary": "Full Name Steve Kim What office are you seeking Illinois Attorney General What offices if any have you previously held Northfield Township Trustee City Deerfield IL Occupation Attorney Education Bachelor 's Degree Loyola University of Chicago Juris Doctorate Loyola University of Chicago School of Law Campaign Website kimforag.com Why should we vote for you for attorney general The career politicians have failed the citizens of Illinois Skyrocketing crime and rampant corruption have become a fact of life in Illinois As a candidate Kwame Raoul vowed to prosecute corruption and tackle crime but he has failed He has ignored the problems in our state I 'm not a career politician and I do n't have the traditional path to be Attorney General But that unique perspective allows me to look at the office through a new lens something different than the career politicians who have filled the office year after year I 'm an attorney who has worked around the world from Cairo IL to Cairo Egypt addressing anti- corruption policies rule of law and public safety policy I 've adjudicated hundreds of civil rights cases as a member of the Illinois Human Rights Commission I understand the role that the Attorney General needs to play in addressing crime and combatting corruption something our current Attorney General does not How do you view the role of attorney general The Attorney General should not only be aggressive in protecting taxpayers but that should also expand to fighting public corruption In my professional career I have worked with governments that are rife with corruption and it creates many of the ongoing systemic issues we see in Illinois government As Attorney General I will fight for taxpayers through consumer protection and in targeting corruption statewide What successes has the attorney general 's office had I would be hard pressed to commend the current Attorney General for doing anything other than successfully shirking his 2018 campaign promises to tackle corruption While passing the buck to federal investigators Kwame Raoul has actively chosen not to pursue corruption for political purposes What needs to be improved The Attorney General 's office is falling short of its responsibilities as the state 's chief law enforcement office There are State 's Attorneys across the state who are failing to fulfill their responsibilities not prosecuting criminals and disregarding the work done by law enforcement in the process I believe the Attorney General 's office needs to work alongside State 's Attorneys and ensure that they are prosecuting cases and taking action to ensure that those who would rather play politics with public safety actually do their jobs What are your thoughts on the Public Access Counselor How can that office be improved Being open and transparent should be the minimum expectation for a statewide office holder Our current Attorney General promised to take on corruption when he ran in 2018 and has not said a word about it since even as major figures who helped get him elected like Speaker Mike Madigan have been indicted This is a transparency and accountability issue I expect to resolve as Attorney General The attorney general 's office was assaulted by a ransomware attack What can the attorney general do to safeguard Illinois residents from being victimized by ransomware attackers The Attorney General needs to work closely with State and Federal partners to both prevent and prosecute cybercrimes First with other statewide offices like the Secretary of State 's office on educational campaigns to teach people how to spot suspicious malware and prevent being victimized Second we need to partner with federal authorities in order to protect and get justice for our most vulnerable who are victimized particularly the elderly As attorney general how would you advocate on behalf of women The Attorney General is expected to work to protect all Illinois residents and addressing the rising crime in this state does just that and in particular helps advocate for women We have State 's Attorneys in Illinois that are not pursuing prosecutions and as Attorney General I will work to ensure that those prosecutions happen We need to make sure that repeat offenders particularly killers and those who assault women are off the streets As attorney general how would you advocate on behalf of older Illinoisans Elder fraud is a crime on the rise across the nation and here in Illinois It is critical for us to put an emphasis on prosecuting elder fraud As Attorney General I would bring together a task force to focus on preventing elder fraud in Illinois sparing our seniors and protecting their personal information and livelihoods including working with federal authorities to address cybercrimes targeting the elderly Does Illinois need to overhaul its criminal justice system If so how What role does the attorney general play in that debate One thing is clear Illinois needs to take action on rising crime immediately Murders are up across the state with Cook County recording more than 1000 murders last year alone That is unacceptable I 've worked in places where people do n't feel safe and the result is the crumbling of societies Businesses closing people are afraid to leave their homes economies crumbling and more This is an issue that needs to be addressed right now and instead Governor Pritzker and Kwame Raoul are playing politics with public safety How can the attorney general be an advocate for consumers Fighting for the consumer is a primary responsibility of the Attorney General ensuring that Illinoisans are not being taken advantage of by organizations capitalizing on the inflation we 're seeing by excessively increasing fees During my career I 've worked in places without anti corruption policies and have seen how bad actors take advantage of citizens through price gouging I will take action to prevent that as Attorney General What is the attorney general 's role in protecting the environment in Illinois The Attorney General is responsible for upholding and enforcing the law in Illinois If there are actors within the state violating environmental or emissions laws the Attorney General is tasked with representing the people and ensuring those actors comply with necessary regulations What will be your top legislative priorities during your term and why Unlike our current Attorney General when I promise to take action on corruption I mean it As Attorney General I will call for strengthened anti corruption legislation that empowers prosecutors to fight for Illinoisans by removing corrupt actors from office I will also push to strengthen support for law enforcement calling for the removal of provisions in the SAFE T act like free time for those on house arrest and no cash bail that are making it more difficult to keep our streets safe",

    "excerpt": "Understanding differences in the various levodopa formulations and assisting with medication therapy management is a crucial role for pharmacists",
    "summary": "Parkinson disease PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer disease 1 Approximately 1 million people in the US are diagnosed with PD and this number is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030 per the Parkinson 's Foundation Parkinson 's Prevalence Project 1 Carbidopa levodopa is considered the gold standard for the management of PD motor symptoms A retrospective cohort study spanning 5 years in 11280 patients revealed that carbidopa levodopa was the most prescribed first line treatment in 70 of the population 2 Since its approval in 1970 multiple formulations have become available This has expanded options for patients but also complicated pharmacologic management for patients caregivers and their providers Understanding differences in the various levodopa formulations and assisting with medication therapy management is a crucial role for pharmacists Image credit LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS | stock.adobe.com Carbidopa Levodopa Immediate Release and Orally Disintegrating Tablets Carbidopa levodopa immediate release IR tablets are commonly the first levodopa formulation prescribed to patients with PD The IR formulation has a peak onset of 30 minutes to 1 hour with a half life of 1.5 to 2 hours 3 There is also an orally disintegrating tablet ODT formulation for patients with difficulty swallowing pills 4 The ODT has a peak onset of 30 minutes and does not require water for administration However as PD progresses the window of levodopa 's effectiveness is significantly reduced resulting in more off time and subsequent requirement of increased doses and/or frequency 5 Dyskinesia and motor on off fluctuations develop in about 50 of PD patients within 5 years of treatment For those new to therapy pharmacists should counsel patients to space doses evenly throughout waking hours Spacing doses throughout the awake hours helps to optimize observed benefits during activities of daily living Additionally patients should be advised to avoid taking doses with high fat high caloric meals because this can delay gastrointestinal absorption up to 2 hours 34 Carbidopa Levodopa Controlled Release Tablets Carbidopa levodopa controlled release CR tablets provide a sustained release formulation It has a bioavailability of 70 to 75 relative to that of IR formulations with a time to peak of 1.5 to 2 hours 57 Because the time to reach maximal concentration is delayed some patients may concomitantly take an IR formulation with the first morning dose The CR tablets utilize a polymeric based drug delivery system that is designed to release carbidopa levodopa over 4 to 6 hours allowing for 3 times per day dosing However CR is less systemically bioavailable than IR formulations and may require higher daily doses in some patients to achieve the same level of symptomatic relief As such levodopa doses > 800 mg may be divided every 4 to 8 hours during the waking hours In clinical trials the CR formulation provided the same therapeutic benefit as the IR formulation however with less frequent dosing when compared to IR Pharmacists should advise patients not to crush chew or cut the CR formulation as this may result in carbidopa levodopa being released too fast Carbidopa Levodopa Extended Release Capsules Carbidopa levodopa extended release ER formulations have a bioavailability of 70 relative to that of IR formulations with an initial peak at 1 hour 8 The ER formulation allows for an extended duration of action due to its unique formulation of time release beads Each capsule consists of one third of IR carbidopa levodopa beads which allows it to start working immediately while the other two thirds consists of ER carbidopa levodopa beads which when coupled with the IR beads allows it to maintain serum levels for up to 5 hours In addition to IR ER beads each capsule also contains an excipient containing tartaric acid This is intended to provide an acidic environment to enhance levodopa absorption.6Because of its duration of action ER formulations can be initiated at 3 times a day and titrated to a maximum of 5 times a day 8 ER formulations are not interchangeable with other carbidopa levodopa formulations due to variations in dosages and pharmacokinetics The prescribing information should be consulted when converting to the ER product For patients who have difficulty swallowing the capsule may be opened and the contents of both halves sprinkled into applesauce and consumed immediately Carbidopa Levodopa Continuous Enteral Solution Enteral carbidopa levodopa bypasses the stomach to allow for continuous administration over 16 hours directly into the small intestine 9 It is administered via a specialty pump into the jejunum through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy PEG J For temporary administration prior to PEG J tube placement treatment may be initiated via a naso jejunal tube Continuous infusion provides steady pharmacokinetics increased efficacy and fewer oral doses throughout the day Prior to initiating enteral therapy all carbidopa levodopa forms should be converted to the IR formulation to facilitate conversion Conversely if a patient receiving enteral carbidopa levodopa is admitted to the hospital and does not have access to it for inpatient use a neurologist should be consulted to temporarily switch to an IR formulation Communication with the outpatient neurologist prior to discharge is also warranted to facilitate transition of care Levodopa Inhalation Powder Levodopa inhalation powder provides on demand inhaled levodopa that starts to work as early as 10 minutes after taking 10 It is intended to reduce the duration of off periods in advanced disease Because it is a rescue therapy it should not be used as primary therapy Levodopa powder for inhalation is supplied in capsules that are inhaled with a product specific inhaler Each dose is comprised of 2 capsules with each capsule loaded into the device and inhaled individually However since the inhalation route is intended for off periods patients with severe symptoms may have trouble setting up the inhaler As such caregivers should also be instructed on proper use of the inhaler device Pharmacist 's Role Errors related to incorrect levodopa formulations are amongst the top errors observed in patients with PD admitted to the hospital 11 With the variety of formulations each with their own unique pharmacokinetic properties appropriate selection is vital Other safety concerns include delays in medication reconciliation and administration Pharmacists should ensure timely reconciliation along with documentation of the patient 's dosing schedule to avoid standardized administration times and omission errors ISMP recommends setting a goal of obtaining a medication history within 2 hours of admission In patients that are alert and oriented discussion with the medical team regarding self administration may be an option to minimize delays Although this is not routinely suggested it may be a solution when frequent every < 4 hours doses are needed Additionally delays in obtaining nonformulary medications should be minimized Consultation with the patient 's neurologist may be of benefit if a specific formulation can not be provided while hospitalized Ensuring abrupt discontinuation of PD medications is essential to avoid significant adverse events References 1 Statistics Parkinson 's Foundation Accessed January 29 2024
