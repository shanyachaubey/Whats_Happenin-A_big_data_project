      "excerpt": "The median rent for a three bedroom home is more affordable than owning a similarly sized house",
      "summary": "When deciding where to live whether through renting or buying it 's crucial to consider housing expenses and overall financial situations Which option aligns better with the budget of the typical U.S. worker According to ATTOM 's 2024 Rental Affordability Report the median rent for a three bedroom home is more affordable than owning a similarly sized house in nearly 90 of local markets nationwide Image Source Photo by PhotoMIX Company | Pexels Also Read 5 ChatGPT Prompts That Can Help Businessowners Be More Present The report highlights that both renting and owning a three bedroom home pose significant financial challenges for average workers using over one third of their wages in most county level housing markets However median rental rates take up a smaller portion of average wages compared to major homeownership expenses in 88 of the 338 U.S. counties analyzed This trend continues into 2023 even though rents have increased more rapidly than home prices in the past year in the U.S. Rising home prices contribute to the escalation of rental costs making both buying and renting challenging across most of the United States explains Rob Barber CEO at ATTOM However recent data shows that despite rent increases renting remains more affordable than owning So does the preference for renting over buying reflect housing market trends that offer limited straightforward options for home shoppers but ultimately lean towards the advantage of rentals Also Read At Least 66 of Americans Do n't Like Tipping 41 Expect Businesses To Pay Their Employees Better Survey The report indicates that in 2023 rental rates and home prices increased in most of the U.S. with rental rates climbing even faster in the majority of counties analyzed Elevated home prices have become further and further out of reach for average workers limiting their ability to obtain mortgages and leaving them with few alternatives other than renting Also Read Here 's why Post Pandemic Resumption of Student Loan Repayments Could Help People Save Taxes 1 Rent Changes vs. Home Price Trends Rents are rising faster than home prices in almost two thirds of the U.S. Median rents for three bedroom homes increased more or declined less than median prices for single family homes in 62 of the 338 counties analyzed 2 Affordability Gaps in Populous Counties The most populous counties show significant affordability gaps between renting and owning Renting a three bedroom home will be more affordable in 2024 compared to owning a median priced single family home in nearly three quarters of markets with populations over one million A general view of properties at North Lakes | Getty Images | Photo by Glenn Hunt 3 Regional Affordability Renting three bedroom homes is most affordable in the South and Midwest In 81 of analyzed counties median three bedroom rents require over one third of the average local wage 4 Home Ownership Affordability The most affordable homeownership markets are in the South and Midwest The least affordable ownership markets are in the West and Northeast 5 Specific Counties Affordability Top Five Most Affordable Southern and Midwest Counties for Owning Jefferson County Birmingham AL Wayne County Detroit MI Ingham County Lansing MI Genesee County Flint MI Caddo Parish Shreveport LA Most Affordable Southern and Midwest Counties for Renting among those with a population of at least 1 million and excluding Wayne County Cuyahoga County Cleveland OH St. Louis County MO Allegheny County Pittsburgh PA Philadelphia County PA 6 Home Price Trends in 2023 Home prices continued to rise in 2023 despite higher mortgage rates mainly due to a tight supply of homes for sale Rent Increases Outpacing Wage Growth in Majority of Markets In 58 of the 338 analyzed counties rents for median three bedroom homes are growing faster than average local wages Notable examples include Los Angeles County CA Harris County Houston TX Maricopa County Phoenix AZ San Diego County CA and Orange County CA outside Los Angeles Conversely wages are outpacing rent growth in 42 of counties encompassing areas like Cook County Chicago IL Kings County Brooklyn NY Miami Dade County FL Queens County NY and San Bernardino County CA Image Source Photo by energepic.com | Pexels Nationwide wages are growing faster than home prices in almost 60 of the country This reversal of the 2023 trend is observed in 58 of the analyzed counties including Los Angeles County CA Cook County Chicago IL Harris County Houston TX Maricopa County Phoenix AZ and San Diego County CA However in 42 of the counties median home prices are rising faster than average weekly wages Examples include Orange County CA outside Los Angeles Kings County Brooklyn NY Miami Dade County FL Broward County Fort Lauderdale FL and Middlesex County MA outside Boston Finding an affordable home remains a daunting prospect for average workers nationwide whether they opt to buy or rent expressed Barber emphasizing the ongoing difficulty in securing affordable housing Regardless of the choice between renting or buying financial considerations are crucial The quest for suitable housing continues to be a challenge for most Americans with hopes for a more streamlined process throughout 2024",

      "summary": "CHAMPAIGN Concerned community members and postal workers are trying to raise awareness about the U.S. Postal Service 's review of the northwest Champaign post office A kickoff event for the Save the Post Office campaign will be held at 1 p.m. Sunday at the Urbana Champaign Independent Media Center in downtown Urbana We 're concerned about the mail being delayed even more than it already is said Barbara Bridges an employee at the Champaign Processing and Distribution Center at 2001 N. Mattis Ave We 're already experiencing staffing shortages and if our mail is sent up to Chicago for processing it 's only going to delay the mail further Bridges who does not represent the post office or the local chapter of the American Postal Workers Union said that a coalition of workers and people from local community groups organized the meeting to raise awareness about an upcoming public hearing that is part of the review process During the Sunday event the IMC 's Gus Wood will deliver a presentation on the history and relevance of the Postal Service and the president of the local union chapter will also be present she said According to a notice from the Postal Service community members can submit comments regarding the Mattis Avenue facility at survey- monkey.com/r/mpfr champaign il If the facility review supports the business case for change to the facility 's processing operations USPS will hold a public meeting to allow members of the local community to provide additional feedback officials wrote A summary of the review will be posted on about.usps.com at least one week prior to the public input meeting A list of facilities undergoing reviews along with related documents such as initial findings and public meeting notices is available at about.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/mpfr/welcome.htm The Postal Service has yet to post a notice for a public meeting for the northwest Champaign post office According to its notice about the review the Postal Service plans to consider whether efficiency could be enhanced by transferring some of the mail processing operations performed at the Champaign facility to similar facilities in Chicago and its south suburbs Additionally officials said that if they decide to move some mail processing operations away from the Champaign facility it is highly likely that it will be modernized and repurposed as a Local Processing Center a Sorting and Delivery Center or both consistent with the broader network redesign Local Processing Centers are critical nodes in the Postal Service 's end to end network model the agency said providing a connection between Regional Processing and Distribution Centers and Sorting and Delivery Centers Within a region S&DCs will expand our network reach officials added saying they will aggregate delivery units into fewer larger and centrally located sites to provide faster and more reliable mail and package delivery over a greater geographic area as compared to traditional delivery units Bridges claimed that many local postal workers will be displaced if the local facility becomes a Local Processing Center or a Sorting and Delivery Center If we lose our outgoing mail to Chicago many of our sorting machines will be dismantled she said Many of our techs clerks and mail handlers will have to move to other cities to keep their jobs or else be forced out of their chosen craft into other roles The Postal Service has stated that the review will not result in the facility 's closure or career employee layoffs When asked what the term career employee means Bridges explained that there is a two tier system for Postal Service employees with newer employees being part of a lower tier She estimated that this lasts for about a year and a half to two years I do n't think that the people at the lower tier have any job security she said She added that the consolidation of carriers into Sorting and Delivery Centers will mean that instead of a semitrailer delivering presorted mail from the Mattis Avenue facility to other post offices in the area letter carriers will have to drive up to an hour to get their mail from the Sorting and Delivery Center then return to their routes to deliver it This will mean that either they will have to make two round trips each day or they will have to leave the mail they 've collected sitting overnight at the local post office until they come back the next day she said Either way it will most certainly delay the mail by an extra day At the national level the postal workers union has expressed similar concerns about the agency 's changes slowing down mail delivery Bridges also fears that the consolidation of pick up and drop off points at Sorting and Delivery Centers could lead to reduced operating hours at rural post offices and a possible escalation of local post office closures",

      "summary": "CHAMPAIGN The U.S. Postal Service will consider the community 's feedback in its review of a local post office 's operations The agency is conducting a review of the Champaign Processing and Distribution Center at 2001 N. Mattis Ave U.S. Postal Service spokesman Tim Norman said According to a notice from the Postal Service members of the local community can submit comments at surveymonkey.com/r/mpfr-champaign-il If the facility review supports the business case for change to the facility 's processing operations USPS will hold a public meeting to allow members of the local community to provide additional feedback officials wrote A summary of the review will be posted on about.usps.com at least one week prior to the public input meeting A list of facilities undergoing reviews along with related documents such as initial findings and public meeting notices is available at about.usps.com/what/strategic-plans/mpfr/welcome.htm Peoria 's processing and distribution center is also under review According to an FAQ document about the Champaign review studies are only just now beginning and the agency anticipates sharing its initial findings in the next month or two The review of the Champaign facility is part of the Postal Service 's 10 year $ 40 billion strategic Delivering for America Plan to modernize its network officials said The review will not result in the facility 's closure or career employee layoffs This specific facility review will inform the best allocation of resources and strategies to improve customer service and to achieve significant cost savings through operational precision and efficiency the agency stated Business mail entry post office station and branch retail services are not expected to change and delivery services will be unaffected throughout this review The modernization evaluation is a first step in the Postal Service review and investment process in this facility During the review the Postal Service will evaluate three main pieces The first is whether efficiency could be enhanced by transferring some of the mail processing operations performed at the Champaign center to the South Suburban and Chicago regional processing and distribution centers A significant percentage of the mail collected in Champaign will travel across our wider transportation and processing network over significant distances to reach their final destinations officials said Mail and packages destined for outside the Champaign area may receive better service and be more cost effectively distributed by aggregating it with mail and packages from other areas going to the same places that will likewise utilize the wider postal network and be transported significant distances from where the mail originated Additionally the Postal Service will work to determine whether operations can be improved by investing in the Champaign facility to redesign mail processing to accommodate changing mail products and mail flow with modern operating strategies equipment and improved employee amenities The review will also consider whether efficiency or service can be enhanced by expanding operations at the facility This could include adding sorting and delivery functions incorporating expanded retail functions and/or increasing local package delivery functions including local transportation initiatives supporting new products being introduced While it may be determined that moving some mail processing operations from the Champaign P&DC is a good business decision it is highly likely under those circumstances that the Champaign facility will be modernized and repurposed as a Local Processing Center a Sorting and Delivery Center or both consistent with the broader network redesign Postal Service officials said Any such repurposing will result in a revitalized modernized and upgraded facility with improved employee amenities and a better working environment Local Processing Centers are critical nodes in the Postal Service 's end to end network model the agency said providing a connection between Regional Processing and Distribution Centers and Sorting and Delivery Centers Within a region S&DCs will expand our network reach officials added saying they will aggregate delivery units into fewer larger and centrally located sites to provide faster and more reliable mail and package delivery over a greater geographic area as compared to traditional delivery units",

      "summary": "Full Name Steve Kim What office are you seeking Illinois Attorney General What offices if any have you previously held Northfield Township Trustee City Deerfield IL Occupation Attorney Education Bachelor 's Degree Loyola University of Chicago Juris Doctorate Loyola University of Chicago School of Law Campaign Website kimforag.com Why should we vote for you for attorney general The career politicians have failed the citizens of Illinois Skyrocketing crime and rampant corruption have become a fact of life in Illinois As a candidate Kwame Raoul vowed to prosecute corruption and tackle crime but he has failed He has ignored the problems in our state I 'm not a career politician and I do n't have the traditional path to be Attorney General But that unique perspective allows me to look at the office through a new lens something different than the career politicians who have filled the office year after year I 'm an attorney who has worked around the world from Cairo IL to Cairo Egypt addressing anti- corruption policies rule of law and public safety policy I 've adjudicated hundreds of civil rights cases as a member of the Illinois Human Rights Commission I understand the role that the Attorney General needs to play in addressing crime and combatting corruption something our current Attorney General does not How do you view the role of attorney general The Attorney General should not only be aggressive in protecting taxpayers but that should also expand to fighting public corruption In my professional career I have worked with governments that are rife with corruption and it creates many of the ongoing systemic issues we see in Illinois government As Attorney General I will fight for taxpayers through consumer protection and in targeting corruption statewide What successes has the attorney general 's office had I would be hard pressed to commend the current Attorney General for doing anything other than successfully shirking his 2018 campaign promises to tackle corruption While passing the buck to federal investigators Kwame Raoul has actively chosen not to pursue corruption for political purposes What needs to be improved The Attorney General 's office is falling short of its responsibilities as the state 's chief law enforcement office There are State 's Attorneys across the state who are failing to fulfill their responsibilities not prosecuting criminals and disregarding the work done by law enforcement in the process I believe the Attorney General 's office needs to work alongside State 's Attorneys and ensure that they are prosecuting cases and taking action to ensure that those who would rather play politics with public safety actually do their jobs What are your thoughts on the Public Access Counselor How can that office be improved Being open and transparent should be the minimum expectation for a statewide office holder Our current Attorney General promised to take on corruption when he ran in 2018 and has not said a word about it since even as major figures who helped get him elected like Speaker Mike Madigan have been indicted This is a transparency and accountability issue I expect to resolve as Attorney General The attorney general 's office was assaulted by a ransomware attack What can the attorney general do to safeguard Illinois residents from being victimized by ransomware attackers The Attorney General needs to work closely with State and Federal partners to both prevent and prosecute cybercrimes First with other statewide offices like the Secretary of State 's office on educational campaigns to teach people how to spot suspicious malware and prevent being victimized Second we need to partner with federal authorities in order to protect and get justice for our most vulnerable who are victimized particularly the elderly As attorney general how would you advocate on behalf of women The Attorney General is expected to work to protect all Illinois residents and addressing the rising crime in this state does just that and in particular helps advocate for women We have State 's Attorneys in Illinois that are not pursuing prosecutions and as Attorney General I will work to ensure that those prosecutions happen We need to make sure that repeat offenders particularly killers and those who assault women are off the streets As attorney general how would you advocate on behalf of older Illinoisans Elder fraud is a crime on the rise across the nation and here in Illinois It is critical for us to put an emphasis on prosecuting elder fraud As Attorney General I would bring together a task force to focus on preventing elder fraud in Illinois sparing our seniors and protecting their personal information and livelihoods including working with federal authorities to address cybercrimes targeting the elderly Does Illinois need to overhaul its criminal justice system If so how What role does the attorney general play in that debate One thing is clear Illinois needs to take action on rising crime immediately Murders are up across the state with Cook County recording more than 1000 murders last year alone That is unacceptable I 've worked in places where people do n't feel safe and the result is the crumbling of societies Businesses closing people are afraid to leave their homes economies crumbling and more This is an issue that needs to be addressed right now and instead Governor Pritzker and Kwame Raoul are playing politics with public safety How can the attorney general be an advocate for consumers Fighting for the consumer is a primary responsibility of the Attorney General ensuring that Illinoisans are not being taken advantage of by organizations capitalizing on the inflation we 're seeing by excessively increasing fees During my career I 've worked in places without anti corruption policies and have seen how bad actors take advantage of citizens through price gouging I will take action to prevent that as Attorney General What is the attorney general 's role in protecting the environment in Illinois The Attorney General is responsible for upholding and enforcing the law in Illinois If there are actors within the state violating environmental or emissions laws the Attorney General is tasked with representing the people and ensuring those actors comply with necessary regulations What will be your top legislative priorities during your term and why Unlike our current Attorney General when I promise to take action on corruption I mean it As Attorney General I will call for strengthened anti corruption legislation that empowers prosecutors to fight for Illinoisans by removing corrupt actors from office I will also push to strengthen support for law enforcement calling for the removal of provisions in the SAFE T act like free time for those on house arrest and no cash bail that are making it more difficult to keep our streets

      "excerpt": "Understanding differences in the various levodopa formulations and assisting with medication therapy management is a crucial role for pharmacists",
      "summary": "Parkinson disease PD is the second most common neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimer disease 1 Approximately 1 million people in the US are diagnosed with PD and this number is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030 per the Parkinson 's Foundation Parkinson 's Prevalence Project 1 Carbidopa levodopa is considered the gold standard for the management of PD motor symptoms A retrospective cohort study spanning 5 years in 11280 patients revealed that carbidopa levodopa was the most prescribed first line treatment in 70 of the population 2 Since its approval in 1970 multiple formulations have become available This has expanded options for patients but also complicated pharmacologic management for patients caregivers and their providers Understanding differences in the various levodopa formulations and assisting with medication therapy management is a crucial role for pharmacists Image credit LIGHTFIELD STUDIOS | stock.adobe.com Carbidopa Levodopa Immediate Release and Orally Disintegrating Tablets Carbidopa levodopa immediate release IR tablets are commonly the first levodopa formulation prescribed to patients with PD The IR formulation has a peak onset of 30 minutes to 1 hour with a half life of 1.5 to 2 hours 3 There is also an orally disintegrating tablet ODT formulation for patients with difficulty swallowing pills 4 The ODT has a peak onset of 30 minutes and does not require water for administration However as PD progresses the window of levodopa 's effectiveness is significantly reduced resulting in more off time and subsequent requirement of increased doses and/or frequency 5 Dyskinesia and motor on off fluctuations develop in about 50 of PD patients within 5 years of treatment For those new to therapy pharmacists should counsel patients to space doses evenly throughout waking hours Spacing doses throughout the awake hours helps to optimize observed benefits during activities of daily living Additionally patients should be advised to avoid taking doses with high fat high caloric meals because this can delay gastrointestinal absorption up to 2 hours 34 Carbidopa Levodopa Controlled Release Tablets Carbidopa levodopa controlled release CR tablets provide a sustained release formulation It has a bioavailability of 70 to 75 relative to that of IR formulations with a time to peak of 1.5 to 2 hours 57 Because the time to reach maximal concentration is delayed some patients may concomitantly take an IR formulation with the first morning dose The CR tablets utilize a polymeric based drug delivery system that is designed to release carbidopa levodopa over 4 to 6 hours allowing for 3 times per day dosing However CR is less systemically bioavailable than IR formulations and may require higher daily doses in some patients to achieve the same level of symptomatic relief As such levodopa doses > 800 mg may be divided every 4 to 8 hours during the waking hours In clinical trials the CR formulation provided the same therapeutic benefit as the IR formulation however with less frequent dosing when compared to IR Pharmacists should advise patients not to crush chew or cut the CR formulation as this may result in carbidopa levodopa being released too fast Carbidopa Levodopa Extended Release Capsules Carbidopa levodopa extended release ER formulations have a bioavailability of 70 relative to that of IR formulations with an initial peak at 1 hour 8 The ER formulation allows for an extended duration of action due to its unique formulation of time release beads Each capsule consists of one third of IR carbidopa levodopa beads which allows it to start working immediately while the other two thirds consists of ER carbidopa levodopa beads which when coupled with the IR beads allows it to maintain serum levels for up to 5 hours In addition to IR ER beads each capsule also contains an excipient containing tartaric acid This is intended to provide an acidic environment to enhance levodopa absorption.6Because of its duration of action ER formulations can be initiated at 3 times a day and titrated to a maximum of 5 times a day 8 ER formulations are not interchangeable with other carbidopa levodopa formulations due to variations in dosages and pharmacokinetics The prescribing information should be consulted when converting to the ER product For patients who have difficulty swallowing the capsule may be opened and the contents of both halves sprinkled into applesauce and consumed immediately Carbidopa Levodopa Continuous Enteral Solution Enteral carbidopa levodopa bypasses the stomach to allow for continuous administration over 16 hours directly into the small intestine 9 It is administered via a specialty pump into the jejunum through a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy PEG J For temporary administration prior to PEG J tube placement treatment may be initiated via a naso jejunal tube Continuous infusion provides steady pharmacokinetics increased efficacy and fewer oral doses throughout the day Prior to initiating enteral therapy all carbidopa levodopa forms should be converted to the IR formulation to facilitate conversion Conversely if a patient receiving enteral carbidopa levodopa is admitted to the hospital and does not have access to it for inpatient use a neurologist should be consulted to temporarily switch to an IR formulation Communication with the outpatient neurologist prior to discharge is also warranted to facilitate transition of care Levodopa Inhalation Powder Levodopa inhalation powder provides on demand inhaled levodopa that starts to work as early as 10 minutes after taking 10 It is intended to reduce the duration of off periods in advanced disease Because it is a rescue therapy it should not be used as primary therapy Levodopa powder for inhalation is supplied in capsules that are inhaled with a product specific inhaler Each dose is comprised of 2 capsules with each capsule loaded into the device and inhaled individually However since the inhalation route is intended for off periods patients with severe symptoms may have trouble setting up the inhaler As such caregivers should also be instructed on proper use of the inhaler device Pharmacist 's Role Errors related to incorrect levodopa formulations are amongst the top errors observed in patients with PD admitted to the hospital 11 With the variety of formulations each with their own unique pharmacokinetic properties appropriate selection is vital Other safety concerns include delays in medication reconciliation and administration Pharmacists should ensure timely reconciliation along with documentation of the patient 's dosing schedule to avoid standardized administration times and omission errors ISMP recommends setting a goal of obtaining a medication history within 2 hours of admission In patients that are alert and oriented discussion with the medical team regarding self administration may be an option to minimize delays Although this is not routinely suggested it may be a solution when frequent every < 4 hours doses are needed Additionally delays in obtaining nonformulary medications should be minimized Consultation with the patient 's neurologist may be of benefit if a specific formulation can not be provided while hospitalized Ensuring abrupt discontinuation of PD medications is essential to avoid significant adverse events References 1 Statistics Parkinson 's Foundation Accessed January 29 2024
