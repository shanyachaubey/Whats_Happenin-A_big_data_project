      "            \"summary\": \"Jan. 27\\u2014Michelle Deines is, in her own words, not a pageant girl.\\nThat's not stopping her from returning to the Mrs. Colorado contest for her second year in a row, representing her home city of Longmont.\\n\\\"I'm a stay-at-home mom, and I am incredibly introverted,\\\" said Deines, Mrs. Longmont 2024. \\\"But I have this passion to want to help people, and I'm just trying to live out what I'm being called to do right now.\\\"\\nDeines competed in last year's Mrs. Colorado pageant alongside her mom, Dianne Haskell, who was Mrs. Firestone. Deines placed in the competition's social media category for her work promoting the pageant, while Haskell won the award for being the longest married contestant.\\nHaskell and Deines are side-by-side again this year as Mrs. Firestone and Mrs. Longmont, respectively. The pageant might be a competition \\u2014 whoever wins Mrs. Colorado in April advances to the Mrs. America contest later this year \\u2014 but Deines said there's no competitiveness between her and her mom.\\n\\\"All of the other women just loved that Mom and I did it together, and that we were so helpful to everybody else,\\\" Deines said. \\\"I'm going to really treasure that forever, having this experience with her doing something that is really unique.\\\"\\nThat lack of competitiveness extends to the rest of the contestants, as well, which Deines likened to a sisterhood.\\n\\\"We're just women who are trying to make a difference in our community in a positive way,\\\" she said. \\\"They all have gifts and talents that they're bringing to the table.\\\"\\nIn addition to homeschooling her two kids, Deines works during the winter as a supervisor at the Longmont Ice Pavilion in Roosevelt Park. She's also an officer for her church and helps with ballot processing for Boulder County during election seasons.\\nDeines' campaign slogan is \\\"Serving Others to Strengthen Communities with Purpose, Kindness and Faith.\\\"\\n\\\"Everything that I do has a purpose,\\\" Deines said, referencing her detail-oriented nature. \\\"(And) we need more kindness in this world, to be loving and accepting of each other.\\\"\\nLast year, Deines started a podcast through Longmont Public Media that highlights a different local nonprofit or service organization every episode. \\\"Serving Locally, with Michelle\\\" has already covered several groups, including the Veterans Community Project of Longmont, St. Vrain State Park and the Longmont Humane Society.\\nKeeping things local is a central feature of Deines' campaign. She buys her pageant gowns from thrift stores in town, her hairdresser lives in Longmont, and her photoshoot for last year's contest took place in the heart of downtown along Main Street.\\n\\\"I'm trying to build up Longmont as much as I can in whatever I'm doing,\\\" Deines said. \\\"I want to have sponsors that are local so I can help them out.\\\"\\nWhile winning the competition would send Deines to Las Vegas for the Mrs. America pageant, first place isn't something she necessarily has her eyes on. If she wins, she can't enter Mrs. Colorado in the future. And for Deines, her favorite part of being Mrs. Longmont is the opportunity to show others what makes the city special.\\n\\\"I want the spotlight so I can shine it and redirect it on other things in the community,\\\" Deines said.\\nMrs. Colorado will be held on April 6 at the Denver Performing Arts Complex, 1400 Curtis St. in Denver.

      "            \"summary\": \"Jan. 24\\u2014When one thinks of a \\\"Hollywood artist,\\\" what typically comes to mind are images of Elizabeth Taylor holding an Oscar or Alfred Hitchcock in a director's chair. (Or, if you're my mom, Chris Hemsworth in a tuxedo.)\\nWhile Longmont-based Ryan Brown doesn't have sultry violet eyes or a contract with Marvel, he has gained a reputation as one of the more sought-after creatives in Hollywood for his work as an \\\"invisible artist\\\" \\u2014 also known as a film editor.\\nAnd though it may seem rather rude to call Brown \\\"invisible,\\\" in the case of film editing, it's a compliment \\u2014 film editors spend hundreds of hours choosing screen transitions, adding sudden sounds, quick-cuts and off-screen audio to weave footage into a cohesive, easy-to-follow narrative. And for viewers, that hard work is meant to go unnoticed.\\nChristopher Osborn, a University of Colorado Boulder Cinema Studies post-production professor \\u2014 who taught Brown as an undergraduate student \\u2014 explained it best:\\n\\\"As an editor, if you're very good at your craft, your imprint on a film should be invisible,\\\" Osborn said. \\\"You don't want audiences to know that the material has been manipulated in any way. You want the whole thing to be a seamless experience.\\\"\\nIn some cases, a film editor is selected before cast members or screenwriters, and in others, the film editor is asked to be on set with a director to help organize the flow of a shoot. In the way that some directors constantly use the same actors (think Wes Anderson and Bill Murray), some directors also choose to work with the same editors, knowing that the work of a skilled editor can make or break any film.\\nBrown, who graduated from CU's film program in 2001, has become the preferred editor for many directors and producers, including Jeff Baena (\\\"Horse Girl,\\\" \\\"Joshy,\\\" \\\"I Heart Huckabees\\\" \\u2014 or, Aubrey Plaza's husband), Tim Robinson (\\\"I Think You Should Leave,\\\" \\\"Detroiters\\\") and most recently, Jake Johnson (\\\"New Girl\\\").\\nFrom the comfort of his home studio in Longmont, Brown recently edited the entirety of Johnson's new film, \\\"Self Reliance.\\\" The movie, which was released on Hulu on Jan. 14, is Johnson's directorial debut. The comedy-thriller follows the story of a middle-aged man named Tommy (Jake Johnson) who is invited into a limo by famous actor Andy Samberg, where Tommy's drab life takes a dramatic turn.\\nThe film is charming, engaging, a little dark and a little nutty. While several funny moments come from Johnson's innate charm and comedic chemistry with the other cast members, a good portion of the laugh-out-loud moments seem to be found in the various montages of Tommy's day-to-day life and jump-cuts of close-up facial expressions that were arranged by Brown. For a directorial debut, \\\"Self Reliance\\\" is impressive \\u2014 but perhaps owes some of its success to Brown's deft hand.\\n\\\"Anything you watch on TV has been manipulated by an editor,\\\" Osborn said, with a laugh. \\\"If you've ever gone out and shot your own stuff, and you play it back, you look like a dork. Editors help people not look like dorks. And that's really what it comes down to. There's no difference between a professional actor or some 13 year old with a webcam. An editor can make either one look badass.\\\"\\nWhen gearing up to watch a couple of scenes from Brown's extensive resume, the research task turned into viewing 300 minutes of film that Brown edited \\u2014 totally on accident but with absolutely no regrets.\\nThroughout his impressive film reel, Brown's editing constantly weaves together a flawless storyline, creating moments that are sometimes hilarious, sometimes tense, sometimes jarring \\u2014 but always engaging. This same mastery can be seen in \\\"Self Reliance\\\" where, despite the film's goofy characters, not a single one of them looks like \\u2014 in the professor's words \\u2014 a dork.\\nWe caught up with Brown to learn what it was like to make the move from Los Angeles to Longmont, make a film with Jake Johnson and how it feels to see his work on the big screen.\\nQ: So it seems like every successful person in Hollywood has a story of their big break. What was yours?\\nA: It's been a long road. I graduated from CU in 2001, and I always knew I wanted to focus on editing. I moved to L.A. two weeks after 9/11, which was a super cool time to be getting a job. And I didn't really know anyone, so I got a job working in a post-production facility in Burbank, basically where my job was to receive actual film canisters and file them away and bring them up to the colorists upstairs. One night, I was working a graveyard shift, from like 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., and this guy came in with a big stack of film from \\\"The Simpsons\\\" \\u2014 and remember thinking to myself, \\\"OK, I picked the right job.\\\"\\nI eventually worked my way up in that company and did some editing on the side. One of my colleagues, Nick Jasenovec, started doing some directing on the side, and he happened to be friends with this guy named Bill Hader from community college. We did some short films together, and Nick ended up getting some money to make a film called \\\"Paper Heart.\\\" We ended up getting Michael Cera on board, and we got that film into Sundance in 2009. So that was my first big break.\\nQ: What drew you to film editing?\\nA: I used to make skateboard videos. I had a camera, back before non-linear editing existed. In the early days of making videos, I was literally hooking up two VHS players together, hitting play on one, and hitting record on the other and mashing together these horrible skate videos. But it also taught me that I could tell a story in all of these different ways, using the same source material.\\nWhen I went to CU, it used to be more of an experimental-based sort of program, so we weren't making narrative kinds of films. It was a whole lot of stuff like putting paint or leaves or scratching up film negatives and running them through the projector. It was a very weird, unconventional film school, but it gave me a different outlook on what film could be, as opposed to something I would have learned at a traditional film school. It was just fun and weird and goofy and opened my eyes to my creative side.\\nQ: How was that move for you, going from a major entertainment hub like Los Angeles to a more quiet, slow-paced town like Longmont?\\nA: In March of 2020, I was working on a show called \\\"The Other Two\\\" on HBO, and then COVID came and everything shut down, but we were able to quickly switch to editing remotely. Nobody knew what they were doing or how to go about it, but over the course of the next few years, things caught up and we figured it out.\\nI love Los Angeles, but my wife and I were considering a move. We have two young kids, and we saw the pandemic as an opportunity to make that change.\\nIt's so funny \\u2014 since the move, I would be working with some famous people on the computer...like Jake Johnson or the guys from The Lonely Island would hop on a Zoom call to talk to me and give me notes, and it would be like I was back there in L.A. Then I would log off, and it would be a bit weird to go out and eat dinner with my family on main street in Longmont. It is this weird kind of dichotomy, still having one foot in the door in Los Angeles and one in a small town like Longmont.\\nQ: What was that like, working with Jake Johnson on his very first film as a director? Was it nerve-wracking?\\nA: I've known Jake for a long time. We met (working) on \\\"Paper Heart\\\" \\u2014 he was the protagonist in that film, so he and I have known each other since 2008. We hadn't worked together professionally much in between that time, but we kind of reconnected a couple of years ago. With first-time directors, trying to establish a rapport with them can be kind of tricky. You're working very intimately with one person for months on end, and sometimes it can be difficult if you don't vibe with the director or they don't vibe with you. But as it turns out, Jake was an incredibly collaborative director, and he's always open to me trying new ideas. He was excellent to work with and was always pushing me to try new things.\\nIn working with Jake \\u2014 we were very meticulous. We showed cuts of the film to friends, and to colleagues, and kept refining and refining. We had four or five test screenings to see what people were responding to, or not responding to. It was hundreds of hours of footage, and having to make a million choices. Movies can really, really change in the editing process. You can have a great script and you can completely ruin it with a horribly edited film, or vice-versa \\u2014 you can have a weak script, and you can elevate the storytelling in the editing process.\\nFor Jake to have directed, filmed and written the film was unique \\u2014 but he was very professional, being able to sit there and critique his own performances in a way that was constructive for the story without letting any kind of ego get in the way was pretty cool to witness.\\nQ: Before the film was released on Hulu, there was a limited one-night premiere in theaters on Jan. 3. Did you go watch the film?\\nA: Yeah, I did! I got a bunch of friends and we all went to see it at the AMC Flatiron Crossing in Broomfield.\\nQ: That's amazing! What was that like?\\nA: To me, editing films can be kind of a solitary task \\u2014 you're sitting there in a room by yourself a lot of the time. To be able to watch it in a theater was one of the best feelings because you finally get to see how all of the jokes are landing, or how they're not landing. I had been working on this film for over a year and a half, so it's nice to finally have it out in the world for people to see.\\nQ: With this film, was there any performances in particular that you had fun bringing to life onscreen?\\nA: Yes. Christopher Lloyd is in this movie briefly \\u2014 you know, the guy from \\\"Back to the Future\\\"? He is an absolute legend. I don't want to give away too much, because his character is in a very pivotal scene in the movie, but it was so cool to be able to cut his performance together and make it all make sense. It was one of the most challenging scenes to edit, but absolutely the most rewarding, just because Christopher Lloyd is such a legendary figure in this industry. I really hope I did him justice.\\nQ: It feels like your career has come full circle \\u2014 starting in Colorado, going out to L.A., and now coming back \\u2014 what advice would you give to the freshly graduated Ryan?\\nA: The best advice that I give to people who want to get into the industry is that if you want to get ahead in Hollywood, you just gotta get out and start making stuff. That's what I did!\\nQ: Maybe you should go teach a class or two at CU.\\nA: I have a secret desire to teach a class or two at CU if they'll have me. I feel like that would be something that I could help students out with. There's not a ton of people like me wandering around the Front Range, and I would love to just help students get out there and get comfortable making stuff. That's the best way to do it.\\n\\\"Self Reliance\\\" is now streaming on Hulu.\",\n",

Jennifer Crumbley said she did not know in which stein the key was hidden.\\nJennifer Crumbley said that while her son had been anxious about getting into college and what he might do with his life, at no point did she think his problems were \\\"to a level where I felt he needed to go see a psychiatrist.\\\"\\nProsecutors will cross-examine Jennifer Crumbley on Friday.\\nWAKE-UP CALL FOR PARENTS\\nProsecutors said as the trial opened that Jennifer and James Crumbley failed to do several \\\"tragically small and easy things\\\" that could have prevented the school shooting.\\nThey argued that the guns in the home were not securely stored and that the parents should have responded to signs their son was having mental health issues.\\nGun safety experts have said they hope the Crumbley trials serve as a wake-up call for parents around the country to better secure weapons in their homes.

James Crumbley's trial opens on March 5.\\nWhen the charges were announced, prosecutors said the Crumbley's failure to both secure the gun in their home and to respond to warnings that their son, Ethan, was violent and disturbed, justified the charges they face.\\nDefense attorneys have said in court documents that the Crumbleys had no way of knowing their son was going to carry out the shooting.\\nLegal experts have said that the parents' trial, which appears to be the first of its kind, breaks new legal ground.\\nJosh Horwitz, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Violence Solutions, said school shooter's parents are often not held to account because of feelings that \\\"they've been through enough\\\" or because of lax enforcement of such measures as safe storage laws.\\nHolding more parents responsible when appropriate is an important step, Horwitz said, given that studies by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security have shown that around 75% of all school shooters obtained their weapons in the home.\\n\\\"Rarely are high school shooters going out and buying guns from a gun store,\\\" Horwitz said. \\\"The broader lesson from this case is that every parent who is a gun owner has a role to play, and that's the secure and safe storage of firearms.\\\"\\nPREVENTABLE TRAGEDY\\nFour days before the Nov. 30, 2021, shooting, Ethan Crumbley accompanied his father to a gun shop, where James Crumbley bought a 9mm handgun, prosecutors said.\\nMichigan law prohibits those under 18 years of age from buying or possessing firearms, except in limited circumstances such as hunting with a license and a supervising adult.\\nEthan posted photos of the gun on social media, writing, \\\"Just got my new beauty today\\\" and adding a heart emoji. The next day his mother posted that the two of them were at a gun range \\\"testing out his new Christmas present,\\\" Oakland County Prosecutor Karen McDonald said when she announced charges against the parents.\\nThe day before the shooting at the school near Detroit, a teacher found Ethan Crumbley using his smart phone to search for ammunition and alerted school officials. The officials left messages for his mother that went unreturned. His mother later texted him, \\\"LOL, I'm not mad at you. You have to learn not to get caught.\\\"\\nOn the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words \\\"Blood everywhere,\\\" \\\"My life is useless,\\\" and \\\"The thoughts won't stop - help me.\\\"\\nEthan told school counselors the drawings were for a video game he was designing, school officials have said.\\nThe Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and that they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.\\nEthan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.\\n\\\"This tragedy could have been prevented if the shooter's parents hadn't played a central role in acquiring the gun for the shooter, or if his parents had taken basic steps to securely store the gun,\\\" said Nick Suplina, senior vice president of Law and Policy at the anti-gun violence nonprofit Everytown for Gun Safety. \\\"They should be held accountable.\\\" (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; editing by Donna Bryson and Michael Perry)\",\n",

They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n \\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Guttridge, farmer and co-owner at Ollin Farms, feeds the chickens. The farm benefits from a county program that helps small growers get their produce to more people.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n \\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n \\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n \\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2013 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2013 many of mixed immigration status \\u2013 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \\n \\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n \\nWin, win, win\\n \\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \\n \\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains. \\n \\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \\n \\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n \\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \\n \\nA force for good\\n \\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n \\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n \\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n \\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \\n \\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n \\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2013 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.\\n \\nPhotography by Rachel Woolf.

      "            \"summary\": \"By Brad Brooks\\n(Reuters) -The mother of a Michigan boy who shot and killed four high-school classmates in 2021 testified in her own defense on Thursday, saying she was not responsible for buying or storing the gun used in the killings.\\nJennifer Crumbley, 45, took the stand in what is believed to be the first trial to target a parent of a school shooter. She and her husband, James Crumbley, 47 - for whom a separate trial is to start in March - are both charged with involuntary manslaughter.\\nThe couple's son, Ethan, who was 15 at the time of the shooting at Oxford High School near Detroit, pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole in December.\\nProsecutors allege that Jennifer and James Crumbley knew their son was mentally in a \\\"downward spiral\\\" and posed a danger to others, yet allowed him to have access to firearms, including the 9mm pistol he used to kill classmates.\\nAsked by her lawyer, Shannon Smith, who was responsible for securely storing firearms in the family home, Jennifer Crumbley replied: \\\"My husband is.\\\"\\n\\\"I just didn't feel comfortable being in charge of that, it was more his thing,\\\" Crumbley testified. \\\"So I let him handle that.\\\"\\nShe said James Crumbley kept the 9mm pistol secured in its case with a cable lock, and that the key for that lock was hidden inside one of several decorative beer steins inside the family home. Jennifer Crumbley said she did not know in which stein the key was hidden.\\nJennifer Crumbley said that while her son had been anxious about getting into college and what he might do with his life, at no point did she think his problems were \\\"to a level where I felt he needed to go see a psychiatrist.\\\"\\nProsecutors will cross-examine Jennifer Crumbley on Friday.\\nWAKE-UP CALL FOR PARENTS\\nProsecutors said as the trial opened that Jennifer and James Crumbley failed to do several \\\"tragically small and easy things\\\" that could have prevented the school shooting.\\nThey argued that the guns in the home were not securely stored and that the parents should have responded to signs their son was having mental health issues.\\nGun safety experts have said they hope the Crumbley trials serve as a wake-up call for parents around the country to better secure weapons in their homes. About 75% of school shooters obtained the guns they used in attacks within their own homes, government research has shown.\\nProsecutors say James Crumbley purchased the 9mm handgun used in the attack four days before his son carried it out on Nov. 30, 2021.\\nOn the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words \\\"Blood everywhere,\\\" \\\"My life is useless,\\\" and \\\"The thoughts won't stop - help me.\\\"\\nThe Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan needed counseling and they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. They said the parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack or ask him about the gun.\\nBut Jennifer Crumbley rejected that version of the school meeting in her testimony. She said that she, her husband and the teachers in the meeting mutually agreed that Ethan could remain in school that day, and that at no point did she think he was a danger to his fellow students.\\nThe meeting \\\"was pretty nonchalant, it was pretty brief,\\\" Crumbley testified, adding that school staff in the meeting said they \\\"didn't feel my son was a risk.\\\"\\nEthan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say.\\n(Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; editing by Donna Bryson and Leslie Adler)\",\n",

One dog escaped its leash during transfer from the property to a vehicle and is still unaccounted for.\\n\\nThe last two dogs were unapproachable Thursday, according to a spokesman from the NoCo Humane Society, one of the responding agencies. Both of those dogs were caught Friday when staffers returned.\\n\\nA spokesperson with the Colorado Department of Agriculture said one dog was euthanized prior to the authorities' arrival by the sanctuary owner, Drew Renkewitz.\\n\\nReached by phone Friday, Renkewitz, 59, said he was in a courtroom trying to get his dogs back.\\n\\nVehicles are shown backed up to a dog housing facility near Lyons on Thursday. The animals were taken from the Just 4 Jacks Ranch and Sanctuary following a court order. NoCo Humane Society\\n\\nTuesday, a permanent injunction was ordered against Renkewitz by a district court judge in Fort Collins (the Just 4 Jacks Ranch at 1740 Spring Gulch Drive is located in Larimer County northwest of Lyons). The order details how Renkewitz was first contacted a year ago by a representative of the Department of Agriculture's Pet Animal Care and Facilities Act (PACFA) Program when 56 dogs were found on the ranch property. The rep at that time \\\"advised Defendant Renkewitz that he could not harbor, house, or shelter more than fifteen (15) dogs in his home without a PACFA license.\\\"\\n\\nRenkewitz applied for a license in March, but the court document indicates Renkewitz's property failed subsequent PACFA inspections on April 4, 2023, June 20, 2023, August 1, 2023, and October 16, 2023.\\n\\nThe license was officially denied in late October, and a cease-and-desist order was made. An administrative search warrant was obtained by state authorities in December. They counted 82 dogs on the property.\\n\\nA permanent injunction was initially ordered to take effect the last day of January 2024, the court document states. However, Renkewitz requested a status conference for Jan. 30. That is the hearing which is reportedly failed to appear. \\\"The Court paused the proceedings for 45 minutes to await (Renkewitz's) arrival,\\\" as stated in the document, before granting the state's motion for permanent injunction.\\n\\nOne of the dogs in a Larimer County animal facility after their court-ordered removal from Just 4 Jacks Ranch and Sanctuary.

Renkewitz, according to that article, named the ranch after his four Jack Russell terriers when he arrived from New York in 2020. He started the sanctuary to care for dogs in need and keep them from being surrendered to high-kill shelters, as stated in the article.\\n\\nCBS\\n\\n\\\"We recognize that this is a challenging and devastating situation for all involved,\\\" stated Judy Calhoun, CEO of NOCO Humane, in a press release. \\\"We are happy to report that the dogs appear to be both healthy and well-socialized with other dogs and people. Hopefully, this means that they won't need to spend too much time in an unfamiliar shelter environment, especially since these dogs are accustomed to living outdoors. We anticipate that these dogs will be excellent adoption candidates, and we look forward to finding each of them a home.\\n\\n\\\"I'm sure these dogs are going to bring a lot of smiles to the faces of their new families.\\\"\\n\\nThe other animal welfare organizations involved in transporting and housing the seized dogs: Animal Friends Alliance, the Cheyenne Animal Shelter, the Dumb Friends League, Foothills Animal Shelter, the Humane Society of Boulder Valley, the Humane Society of the Pike Peak Region, Mattersville, Maxfund, National Mill Dog Rescue, NoCo Humane, and Riverdale Animal Shelter.\",\n",

But most of those far-flung locales are bucket-listers, the kinds of destinations that make for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or a special adventure.\\n\\nSo we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024, but with more manageable goals \\u2014 and with a nod toward Colorado connections. We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport, because travel is already difficult these days \\u2014 prices, crowds, cancellations. Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nBon voyage.\\n\\nIN COLORADO\\n\\n\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of , Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft beer highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated driver and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which \\u2014 like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei \\u2014 are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest fourteener to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado fourteeners that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range \\u2014 at any time of year, really \\u2014 in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore \\u2014 and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES\\n\\nSpring training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball or the Colorado Rockies, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s \\u2014 a nice break from cold Colorado weather \\u2014 and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, N.M.\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so you can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, N.C.\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, N.C., in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25\\u2013June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings \\u2014 which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating the eclipse with ranger-led activities. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\n\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but  \\u2014 and Hapuna Beach \\u2014 might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOVERSEAS\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to The Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. \\nAir France has been flying direct from DIA\\n in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, \\nis set to reopen in December 2024\\n.\\n\\n\\nDublin\\n\\n\\nFor being the \\nsixth-busiest airport in the entire world\\n, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years \\u2014 and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\n\\nVisitors to Iceland's Blue Lagoon spa swim in pools of milky-blue, 99-degree geothermal waters.\\n\\n\\nIceland\\n\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island national has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since \\nthey are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis\\n, or Northern Lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis \\u2014 and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and \\na magical group of rockabilly street performers\\n.\\n\\n\\nMorning at Jakes in Treasure Beach, St. Elizabeth, Jamaica. (Provided by Jakes hotel)\\n\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' \\nas we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital\\n. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. \\nRead more about this sunny destination\\n \\u2014 along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture \\u2014 in our recent travel guide.\\n\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become \\na hot travel destination in the past decade\\n, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\n\\nA vendor sells coconut drinks at a beach at Manuel Antonio in Costa Rica. (Evelyne Horovitz, The Washington Post)\\n\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but \\nCosta Rica has been particularly popular\\n recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to \\nThe Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park\\n. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays.\\n\\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. \\u2014 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.\\n\\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.\\n\\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago.\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level.\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n\\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n\\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n\\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2014 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Jimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health.\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2014 many of mixed immigration status \\u2014 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand.\\n\\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n\\nWin, win, win\\n\\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill.\\n\\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains.\\n\\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Mark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right.\\n\\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n\\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach.\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition.\\n\\nA force for good\\n\\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n\\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n\\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n\\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people.\\n\\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n\\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2014 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.\\n\\nPhotography by Rachel Woolf.

      "            \"summary\": \"From The Denver Post\\n\\nDENVER\\u2014Every year, The New York Times publishes a list titled '52 Places to Go,' and it makes for great reading and even better daydreaming. But most of those far-flung locales are bucket-listers, the kinds of destinations that make for a once-in-a-lifetime trip or a special adventure.\\n\\nSo we decided to come up with our own list of places to go in 2024, but with more manageable goals\\u2014and with a nod toward Colorado connections. We also leaned heavily on road trips or nonstop flights from Denver International Airport, because travel is already difficult these days\\u2014prices, crowds, cancellations. Why make it any harder?\\n\\nHere are 24 places for Coloradans to travel this year, broken down into destinations in Colorado, elsewhere in the United States, and other countries or overseas.\\n\\nThis year marks the 25th anniversary of Black Canyon of the Gunnison National Park, Colorado's fourth and least-visited member of the nation's most prestigious open-space club. Named for the depths of the steep and narrow canyon that splits it, Black Canyon can be tackled in a variety of ways, from scenic drives and rim-side hiking to challenging treks to the bottom. And you will find far fewer people than at Rocky Mountain National Park or the Great Sand Dunes. Montrose, about five hours from Denver, is a popular kickoff point.\\n\\nCamp Hale-Continental Divide National Monument\\n\\nDesignating the 84,500 acres where Colorado's famed 10th Mountain Division trained for its role in World War II as a national monument in 2022 didn't change it much. The area southwest of Vail is still used for camping and fishing, snowmobiling and ATV riding. But it's gorgeous country, and worth a stay at the campground. Want to learn more about it? There is a new exhibit at History Colorado in Denver that delves into the story of the 10th and the legacy it left behind.\\n\\nBoulder\\n\\nBoulder doesn't really need the attention, but it got plenty in 2023 with the arrival of Coach Prime at the University of Colorado. But the city is more than football and cliches. In fact, in November Fodor's named it as one of 24 places to visit in the entire world in 2024 (only one other U.S. destination was included). The travel guide honed in on Boulder's scenery, open space and accessibility to recreation and nature, as well as the Pearl Street Mall's dining options. We would add that there are plenty of awesome breweries, as well as a Michelin-starred restaurant (Frasca).\\n\\nCraft Beer Highway\\n\\nThe origins of Colorado's craft beer culture date back to 1979, when Boulder Beer Co. was founded in a goatshed in Hygiene (about 10 minutes west of U.S. Highway 287 in Longmont). There are now more than 420 craft breweries in the state, a surprising number of which are located just a mile or two on either side of 287, between Broomfield and Fort Collins. In fact, you could call this 50-mile stretch the Colorado Craft Beer Highway. Wanna get a taste? Find a designated drive and hit up a couple of dozen of these treasures, some of which\\u2014like Liquid Mechanics, Cellar West, Verboten and Zwei\\u2014are among the best small breweries in the state.\\n\\nMount Blue Sky\\n\\nIt's not the tallest mountain in Colorado, but it's the closest 14\\u2018er to Denver and one of the best-known peaks in the state. And last September, Mount Evans (at 14,130 feet) was renamed as Mount Blue Sky after years of campaigning by Native American groups. With the change, it's a good time to remember that this is one of the few Colorado 14'ers that motorists can drive to the top of (although not in winter). The views up there are gorgeous, and there is a good chance you'll see mountain goats and wildflowers along the way.\\n\\nGlenwood Springs\\n\\nThere's nothing quite like boarding Amtrak's California Zephyr at Union Station and riding it to Glenwood Springs, peering out at not just the stunning expanses of Glenwood Canyon, but also the less-often-seen backside of Denver and its suburbs. Glenwood itself has evolved quite a bit in the past few years, with big changes (already completed or still on their way) to some of its hot springs, like Glenwood Hot Springs Resort and Iron Mountain Hot Springs, among others. The little downtown strip beneath the overpass is also a charming spot for a bite, a stroll, some entertainment and a beer, perhaps from Casey Brewing & Blending's lively taproom.\\n\\nAmache National Historic Site\\n\\nWanna get away? You don't need Southwest Airlines. Just drive east from the Front Range\\u2014at any time of year, really\\u2014in the opposite direction of where most people are headed. One fascinating destination is the Granada Relocation Center at the Amache National Historic Site, which became part of the National Park System in 2022. Amache was one of 10 forced relocation centers in the United States where tens of thousands of Japanese citizens and people of Japanese descent were imprisoned during World War II. Today, there is a cemetery, a monument and landscaping to explore\\u2014and to remember.\\n\\nMountain Plover Festival, Karval\\n\\nSpeaking of eastern Colorado, one of the most unusual birding festivals in the world takes place every April (it's April 26-28 this year) in Karval. What makes the Mountain Plover Festival different? There are no motels or restaurants in Karval, so reservations are required and attendees stay with local ranching families (meals and entertainment are provided). So, in addition to bird-watching tours (mountain plovers are a rare breed and difficult to see), you learn about the history and community of the area. Karval is about 2 hours southeast of Denver in Lincoln County.\\n\\nIn The United States\\n\\nSpring Training in Arizona\\n\\nNo matter how you feel about baseball, Major League Baseball's Cactus League Spring Training in the Phoenix/Tempe/Scottsdale area can be a magical experience. And, as we wrote in our recent travel guide on Scottsdale, it's also 'a nice excuse to slip away to the Sonoran Desert,' where springtime temperatures are in the mid-70s\\u2014a nice break from cold Colorado weather\\u2014and there are pools aplenty.\\n\\nBaaj Nwaavjo I'tah Kukveni Grand Canyon National Monument, Arizona\\n\\nGrand Canyon National Park is the second most visited park in the system, with nearly 5 million visitors per year, but the land around it received a special designation in 2023 when President Joe Biden banned mining on nearly 1 million acres in order to protect the ecosystem and preserve Native American sacred sites. The national monument isn't that easy to 'visit,' since it consists mostly of open space, but there are a few historic and cultural highlights of interest.\\n\\nHatch, New Mexico\\n\\nThe great chile debate rages on between Colorado and New Mexico about which state produces the biggest and best peppers. Why not find out for yourself on a road trip to the area around Hatch, N.M., an agricultural community that many consider to be the Napa Valley of chiles. Other things to see in the area: White Sands, Carlsbad Caverns and Guadalupe Mountains national parks, along with the Bosque Del Apache National Wildlife Refuge and plenty of historic sites featured in the recent movie (and Oscar nominee) 'Oppenheimer.' (Make sure to stop in Pueblo, Colo., on your way back up Interstate 25, though; that's the heart of Colorado's own green chile country, so you can settle the debate for yourself.)\\n\\nAsheville, North Carolina\\n\\nDIA added a new nonstop flight to Asheville, North Caroline, in September, and 2024 is a great time to visit since Denver's TRVE Brewing plans to open a second location there in the next few months. (Fort Collins-founded New Belgium also has a taproom there.) But Asheville, set along the dreamy Blue Ridge Parkway, should be on any Coloradan's list anyway, because in addition to its incredible craft brewery scene, it's an outdoor lovers mountain playground.\\n\\nNew York City\\n\\nThere's never a bad time to visit the Big Apple, but 2024 will offer a couple of enticing draws, including a game between the Denver Broncos and the New York Jets at MetLife Stadium (the date is still TBA); the June 28 opening of the brand new visitors center at Stonewall National Monument; and a highly touted exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, 'The Harlem Renaissance and Transatlantic Modernism' (Feb. 25 to June 28). Plus, you can get your fill of ramen, pizza, bagels and dumplings\\u2014which is always a reason for joy.\\n\\nCleveland\\n\\nAh, the Land. A city on the comeback, Cleveland is a shortish trip by air, and in 2024, it happens to be in the path of a full eclipse (or the path of 'totality'), which will cut northeast from Texas to New England on April 8. Why Cleveland? Well, there is a small and lesser-known national park just 30 minutes away, called Cuyahoga Valley, which will be celebrating. And while you're in the vicinity, take in a Cleveland Guardians game at beautiful Progressive Field, as it opens the baseball season against the Chicago White Sox on the same day.\\n\\nThe Big Island\\n\\nThe mountains here are stunning, certainly, but let's face it: Sometimes we need the smell of coconut oil, the sound of waves and the expanse of the ocean. Airlines offer direct flights from DIA to all four of Hawaii's major islands, but The Big Island\\u2014and Hapuna Beach\\u2014might be the most beautiful of them all. Expansive, warm and a great place to snorkel, Hapuna is truly mesmerizing. But don't stop there. In addition to Hawai\\u02bbi Volcanoes National Park and gorgeous shorelines, the Big Island also boasts white sand, green sand and black sand beaches. Set against the backdrop of Mauna Kea and Mauna Loa, a visit here is the cure to cabin fever.\\n\\nOverseas\\n\\nParis\\n\\nMaybe it doesn't sound appealing to fly to Paris at the hottest, busiest, most congested time of the year. Or maybe seeing the Olympic games while sipping cafe au lait and eating baguettes is exactly what you need. Either way, there will be plenty of athletes with Colorado connections in the City of Light when the games start on July 26. Air France has been flying direct from DIA in recent years, and if the Olympics aren't your thing, then consider this: Notre Dame Cathedral, which nearly burned down in 2019, is set to reopen in December 2024.\\n\\nDublin\\n\\nFor being the sixth-busiest airport in the entire world, DIA doesn't have many direct nonstop international flights. So it's worth celebrating each and every new one. In May, Irish airline Aer Lingus will begin connecting Denver with Dublin, Ireland's lively capital city. The historic sites here go back more than 1,000 years\\u2014and you can (and should) tour the Guinness beer and Jameson whiskey plants. Dublin is also the kickoff point to the famed Irish countryside, including the Cliffs of Moher, Giant's Causeway and Killarney National Park.\\n\\nIceland\\n\\nAlso on the slim list of international destinations accessible by a nonstop flight from DIA is Iceland, with its waterfalls, blue lagoons and adorable puffins. The island nation has been on a lot of bucket lists for at least a decade now. But 2024 and 2025 hold particular appeal since they are expected to be the best years in a while to see the Aurora Borealis, or northern lights, which appear more colorfully on a cyclical basis\\u2014and which are fairly easy to catch in Iceland.\\n\\nTokyo\\n\\nJapan's capital may be the only destination in Asia to which you can fly nonstop from Denver, and it's worth the trip. The city is like no other place in the world, and you could spend months just getting to know a single neighborhood. It's also full of just about any kind of activity you could want, from visits to spectacular cultural and historical sites to dining, recreation, or just people-watching. There's also craft beer, whiskey, manga and a magical group of rockabilly street performers.\\n\\nJamaica\\n\\nLast February, Frontier Airlines began flying direct from Denver to Montego Bay, Jamaica, 'cutting down to around five hours a trip that used to take all day, with a stopover,' as we wrote in a travel guide to the country's tourist capital. So, for laid-back beach bars, sizzling jerk chicken, swimming holes and, of course, music, this might be the year for a trip to the Caribbean.\\n\\nPuerto Rico\\n\\nNot to be outdone, United introduced a daily direct flight to San Juan, Puerto Rico, in October, slashing travel time to the island by several hours. Even better, you don't need a passport to visit this U.S. territory. You will need to bring an appetite for spicy codfish fritters, plantains and tropical rum drinks, however. Read more about this sunny destination\\u2014along with its beaches, rainforests, history and culture\\u2014in our recent travel guide.\\n\\nMexico City\\n\\nMexico City has always been one of the most complex and richly dynamic cities in the Americas, but it has also become a hot travel destination in the past decade, with several neighborhoods teeming with art, culture and cuisine. Some of the most rewarding activities include Wandering the Roma Norte neighborhood in search of blue corn tortillas, churros or cute coffee shops; catching the spectacle of lucha libre; visiting the Frida Kahlo Museum or the Museo Nacional de Antropologia; and trying chapuline with your mezcal. Oh, and at 7,200 feet in altitude, it's one of the few capital cities that is higher than Denver, so you should feel right at home.\\n\\nCosta Rica\\n\\nThe 'pura vida' never goes out of style, but Costa Rica has been particularly popular recently as more and more people discover this lush, friendly country where adventure and easy living seem to blend perfectly. The airlines only fly nonstop from Denver to four countries in Central America, but this is one of them. Whether you want wildlife, scenery, great coffee, rainforests, beaches or culture, Costa Rica offers one of the easiest, most beautiful ways to take a tropical vacation.\\n\\nBanff National Park\\n\\nTo get some perspective on Colorado's rocky peaks, take a bucket-list trip to Canada's Banff National Park, where 'the mountains have rock faces at a scale you just don't see in Colorado. And every lake is a different hue of vibrant blue or green,' according to The Denver Post's extensive travel guide on how to travel to, and camp in, the park. A two-hour flight to Calgary, followed by a 90-minute drive, will land you in stunning beauty that you have to see to believe.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"Deion Sanders is on the move, but it's not what you think.\\nNo, Coach Prime isn't leaving Colorado. In fact, he's moving closer to the university, thanks to his three sons.\\u00a0\\nColorado\\n players \\nShedeur\\n and \\nShilo Sanders\\n, along with their oldest brother Deion Jr., bought their father a new home in the Boulder area. They showed off the 17,000 square-foot mansion \\nin a video posted to social media Saturday\\n.\\u00a0\\nThe house, which Sanders' sons joked covered \\\"three time zones,\\\" is located in the mountains and includes several luxurious amenities, such as an in-home theater, a wine cellar, a basketball court and a deck that looks out to the mountains and a nearby lake. Sanders \\npreviously bought a home in Longmont, Colorado\\n in March 2023, which is located roughly 15 miles from Colorado's campus.\\u00a0\\nBoth Sanders and his sons, who Coach Prime thanked and referred to as \\\"natural givers,\\\" shared some sentimental moments in the now-viral video.\\n\\\"For y'all three to want to put it together, just so you'll make sure I'm straight when y'all gone is unbelievable son,\\\" Sanders said. \\\"It almost provokes a tear. It's one thing to look at the mountains, but it's one thing to be in the mountains. We're in the mountains. You know how much I love water, so just to walk and see this view.\\\"\\n\\\"You take care of everybody for a long time,\\\" Deion Jr. replied.\\u00a0\\nSanders' first season at Colorado started off with a bang, winning its first three games of the season to help bring the program its most prominent national relevance in decades. But after their 3-0 start, the Buffaloes only went 1-8 the rest of the way, missing out on a bowl game for the seventh straight season.\\u00a0\\nColorado has promise entering Year 2 of the Coach Prime era. Both Shedeur and Shilo opted to return instead of entering the 2024 \\nNFL\\n Draft. Shedeur was one of \\ncollege football\\n's top passers statistically this past season, throwing for 3,230 yards, 27 touchdowns and three interceptions. Shilo, meanwhile, recorded an interception and four interceptions. Both brothers are viewed as possible high-round prospects for the 2025 NFL Draft.\\nAs it appears Sanders has one more season coaching his two sons at Colorado, he was grateful for the gift more than anything else. \\\"I appreciate this though,\\\" Sanders said. \\\"My three sons, want to do this for me, wow. This is awesome.\\\"\\n\\\"Your life's complete now,\\\" Deion Jr. added.\\n\\\"We've got to win,\\\" Coach Prime replied. \\\"That's when it's complete.\\\"\\n \\n \\nrecommended\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nGet more from College Football\\n \\nFollow your favorites to get information about games, news and more\",\n",

Londregan arrived 20 minutes later. \\n During the traffic stop, troopers learned that Cobb was \\\"wanted for violation of a protective order\\\" in nearby Ramsey County, though there was no warrant out for his arrest, according to the complaint. Troopers told Cobb he was under arrest after he repeatedly refused a request to leave his vehicle. \\n When Londregan opened the passenger-side door, Cobb put the car into gear and it began to slowly roll forward. Another trooper reached in on the driver's side, apparently trying to unhook Cobb's seatbelt. Londregan then fired two rounds into Cobb's torso.\\n Cobb's car rolled about a quarter mile down the road and crashed. The troopers attempted first aid but Cobb died at the scene.\\n (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; editing by Donna Bryson and Stephen Coaes)\\n By Brad Brooks\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"(Reuters) - Lawyers were to make opening statements on Thursday in the trial of a Michigan woman whose teenage son used a gun she and her husband allegedly gave him as a Christmas present to kill four schoolmates. \\nTwelve jurors and five alternates were empanelled in Pontiac, Michigan, Wednesday afternoon, the court said, to hear a rare trial of a parent facing criminal charges in a school shooting.\\n Jennifer Crumbley, 45, and her 47-year-old husband James Crumbley, who will be tried separately next month, are each charged with four counts of manslaughter. \\n Their son, Ethan, who was 15 at the time of the 2021 shooting at Oxford High School near Detroit, pleaded guilty in 2022 to two dozen counts, including four of first-degree murder, and last month was sentenced to life in prison without parole. \\n In the past, Jennifer Crumbley's attorneys have said she could not have anticipated her son would carry out a school shooting, and that the weapon had been safely secured in the home. \\n She has asked Sixth Judicial Circuit Court Judge Cheryl Matthews to force her son to testify, according to documents filed this week with the Pontiac, Michigan, court by her attorney Shannon Smith. \\n Public defenders representing Ethan Crumbley as he appeals his life sentence are fighting any order that would compel him to testify, and say they will advise him to invoke his right to remain silent if he is called.\\n Gun safety experts have said they hope the Crumbley trials serve as a wake-up call for parents around the country to better secure weapons in their homes. About 75% of school shooters obtained the guns they used in attacks within their own homes, government research has shown. \\n Experts have said the parents' trials break new legal ground. \\n Prosecutors say James Crumbley purchased the 9mm handgun used in the Oxford High attack four days before his son carried it out on Nov. 30, 2021. \\n On the morning of the shooting, a teacher discovered drawings by Ethan Crumbley that depicted a handgun, a bullet, and a bleeding figure next to the words \\\"Blood everywhere,\\\" \\\"My life is useless,\\\" and \\\"The thoughts won't stop - help me.\\\"\\n The Crumbleys were called to the school on the morning of the shooting, and told that Ethan urgently needed counseling and they needed to take him home, prosecutors have said. The parents resisted the idea of taking their son home and did not search his backpack nor ask him about the gun.\\n Ethan Crumbley was returned to class and later walked out of a bathroom with the gun and began firing, prosecutors say. \\n (Reporting by Brad Brooks in Longmont, Colorado; editing by Donna Bryson and Chris Reese)\\n By Brad Brooks\",\n",

They're smaller, however, only reaching about 28 inches long and weighing merely two pounds, according to CPW.\\n\\nThese animals are more common in areas like Texas and Arizona but are known to be found in Colorado.

'We really aren't sure how this little critter ended up in a Longmont pantry. Perhaps it hitched a ride? It's hard to know, but there have been sightings on the Front Range so it's not completely out of the question that it was simply living in the wild and then decided to pry itself indoors during the recent cold snap.'\\n\\nTatro explained that the creatures are nocturnal and solitary, making people less likely to spot them.\\n\\n'They are great climbers that thrive in canyon landscapes which could be another reason why we don't see them day to day,' Tatro said.\\n\\nGreenwood Wildlife worked with CPW to rescue the healthy animal from the pantry, evaluate it and release the mammal back into Colorado's wild outdoors.\\n\\nIf you do happen to see the small creatures, Colorado Parks and Wildlife warns individuals to not try and touch any wild animals, perhaps just take a picture.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"COLORADO SPRINGS, Colo. (KXRM) \\u2014 A Colorado Springs guitar received a major makeover with glitter, jewels, and layers of vibrant paint.\\n\\nThe guitar was bought on Facebook Marketplace by Tiffany Thompson and Chris Estrada who envisioned turning this instrument into something more meaningful to help give back to charity.\\n\\n'We found on Facebook Marketplace a retired military veteran that had this Taylor guitar because we wanted it to be a Taylor guitar because of Taylor Swift,' said Thompson. 'Usually, I get the cheaper kind of repurposed guitars that are not in good shape for about $50 to $100.'\\n\\nThis is not the first time Thompson used her talents to paint a guitar \\u2014 several years ago she was first tasked with channeling her creativity.\\n\\n'I do all kinds of other paintings, I do murals, and I've always done art,' Thompson said. 'But I was asked if I could paint a guitar for someone a couple of years ago and had never thought about it, and so I did and that's just kind of how it started. Then I started getting asked mostly for charities if I would paint guitars for their auctions and to raise money for charity.'\\n\\nRingtail cat found in Longmont pantry, but what is that animal?\\n\\nWhile the two are avid Kansas City Chiefs fans, Estrada deserves recognition for bringing the idea to life, with the instrument sharing the same name as the award-winning performer.\\n\\n'We were looking around marketplace for different guitars and she'd found several and then when I came up with the idea, \\u2018Hey, why don't you paint Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift guitar?'' Estrada said. 'I thought, what better than to find a Taylor guitar to put it on.'\\n\\nAfter purchasing the Taylor guitar, Thompson dove into action by not only getting the necessary paint and pens but also carefully planning the design on this unique canvas.\\n\\n'You had to get kind of creative with all the sound hole and the shape of it to kind of make it all fit,' Thompson said. 'So, I usually kind of sketch it out beforehand on a copy of a guitar so I can see how it's going to fit.'\\n\\nSaturated in the spirit of 'Bejeweled' along with multiple other Swift songs, this guitar sparkles with added bling to elevate the masterpiece.\\n\\n'Then my favorite part is putting the finishing touches on it and like the bling and outlining it so that it really pops and it comes to life,' Thompson said. 'But leading up to it, like when you're priming, I always tell people, don't look at it until it's done, because I like the finished product when you get all the sparkles on it and the details.'\\n\\nUnder these layers of paint, there's more meaning to this work with the ultimate goal to raise funds for a Hope House. She would like to get the guitar signed by both Swift and Kelce, with the profits going toward a good cause.\\n\\n'So in 2015, I ended up at the domestic violence shelter in Kansas City, it's Independence, Missouri, which is Kansas City area, they helped me,' Thompson said. 'So, over the course of the next probably seven months, I went to counseling, they have a lot of resources so that I could start over because I basically just had to start over at age 47.'\\n\\nHer own personal connection to the domestic violence shelter motivates her not only to keep chasing this autograph dream but also reveals the profound impact a donation could have on so many individuals.\\n\\n'You need to get a good night's sleep, you need food, you need that help,' Thompson said. 'You can't sometimes go to your family because you don't want to draw your family into that, you know, time of your life and put them in danger. So it's really important for these shelters to get money for the women and children just to be able to have someplace to go and be safe.'\\n\\nWhile proceeds from this guitar will go to the shelter in Kansas City that helped her, Thompson is on a mission to not stop there and continue raising funds for other Hope Houses across the country.\\n\\nIn the process of working away on the guitar, she has documented every step on social media with the hope that these superstars will catch a glimpse of her artistic endeavor.\\n\\n'It's just really cool seeing everybody comment on the videos and the news bits,' Estrada said. 'I never expected it, but, you know, I can't wait to see Taylor and Travis sign this thing because I know it's going to happen.'\\n\\nYou can follow her journey on Instagram @Guitaristtiffany or Facebook @Guitartist.\\n\\nWhile Thompson is chasing her 'Wildest Dreams,' she hopes to make the power duo aware of the specially crafted guitar, especially since there's a blank space waiting for their names.\\n\\n'I just really wanted to get it signed and however it happens would just be a blessing,' Thompson said. 'But I just want to get it signed, so that we can just hand that money over to Hope House and get some money raised.'\",\n",

      "            \"excerpt\": \"This prime cut of bovine bud surpassed expectations from jar to ash.\",\n",
      "            \"summary\": \"A nice steak is often expensive, but nothing comes close to wagyu. Marbled with vast spiderwebs of tender fat and raised in Japan under relatively cushy circumstances, true wagyu costs more than some paychecks, especially if it's A5 grade, the highest score for Japanese wagyu. That's the real top shelf.\\n\\n\\nI can barely afford a few thin slices of wagyu sashimi in Denver, let alone a full ribeye. This is usually when I'm grateful for finding a weed variety of the same name that's much cheaper, but I had to wait until payday to buy an eighth of A5 Wagyu from \\nGreen Dot Labs\\n, too. Given the Boulder cultivation's sterling reputation for bringing the heat, though, I knew that this steak had enough sizzle and substance to satisfy. \\n Green Dot mixed in-house cuts of Downshift and Candy Cake to breed this prime cut of bovine bud, which surpassed\\u00a0my expectations from jar to ash. This A5 was an A10, thanks to a meaty aroma and an incredibly potent high guaranteed to surprise anyone who tries it for the first time, no matter their tolerance. In fact, A5 Wagyu is so powerful that I wouldn't recommend it as an all-day strain, because most people are destined for the dunce corner after their second hit.\\n\\n\\nThen again, wagyu steaks aren't meant to be marinated, grilled or even eaten on a weekly basis. They're too rich to approach like any other steak, and the same goes for this beast of a \\nsavory strain\\n. I puff like a coal plant in the '70s, and one bong rip of A5 Wagyu sends my brain to slaughter. Once I knew what to expect, though, A5 Wagyu became one of my favorite Green Dot creations.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLooks: \\nJust like heavy marbling, trichome coverage on A5 Wagyu is so thick that your eyes might miss the purple hues and subtle blue spots underneath that white coat. The gnarled, dolloped buds are denser than they look, and their shape adds to the intimidation.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSmell: \\nDon't let Green Dots' description of \\\"fatty, savory gas\\\" scare you away. That might sound like a bad post-burrito experience, but opening a jar of A5 Wagyu showcases a sweet, rubbery funk that longtime cannabis lovers go crazy for, with a zesty onion blanket and buttery finish. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFlavor: \\nA5 Wagyu's savory notes of garlic and onion play well with a dominant gassy funk, both of which stick to my cheeks as fatty, nutty flavors jump around my tongue. The combination creates a strong aftertaste.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nEffects: \\nA little A5 Wagyu goes a long way. I don't need a full bong rip to visit new dimensions, and that's barely hyperbole. This is a visual, almost psychedelic high that starts in the brain and works downward. While it leaves enough energy for something, I'm usually too stoned to know what that something might be before inevitably turning into dust on my couch. Unless you want to sit under a tree or look at the clouds, keep this one indoors. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nWhere to find it: \\nWe've spotted this Green Dot exclusive in flower or extracted form at A Cut Above, Allgreens, Berkeley Dispensary, Best High, Boulder Wellness, Callie's Cannabis Shoppe, the Cannabis Depot, Chronic Therapy, Colorado Harvest Company, Del Mundo Cannabis, Den-Rec, Denver Kush Club, the Dispensary Littleton, Doc's Apothecary, Eclipse Cannabis Company,\\u00a0 Elevated Longmont, the Farm, Golden Meds, Green Dragon, Green Valley Dispensary, Greenfields, the Green Solution, High Level Health, Higher Grade, Karing Kind, Kind Love, Lakeshore Cannabis, Life Flower Dispensary, Lightshade, Lova, Magnolia Road Cannabis Co., Maikoh Holistics, Medicine Man, Native Roots, Nature's Kiss, Oasis Cannabis Superstores, Peak, Potco, Pure Dispensary, Reefer Madness, RiNo Supply Co., Rocky Road, Simply Pure, Skunked, Snaxland, Social Cannabis, Solace Meds, Spark, Standing Akimbo, Star Buds, Unity Road and Xclusive Cannabis, but more stores likely carry it.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Is there a strain you'd like to see profiled?

Troopers told Cobb he was under arrest after he repeatedly refused a request to leave his vehicle.\\nWhen Londregan opened the passenger-side door, Cobb put the car into gear and it began to slowly roll forward. Another trooper reached in on the driver's side, apparently trying to unhook Cobb's seatbelt. Londregan then fired two rounds into Cobb's torso.\\nCobb's car rolled about a quarter mile down the road and crashed.

      "            \"summary\": \"It is hard to tell which Colorado Democrats hate more: the Second Amendment or local control of government. A newly drafted bill sponsored by Dems allows them to continue to attack them both.\\nLess than three years ago, Sen. Sonja Jaquez Lewis of Longmont, Sen. Chris Kolker of Littleton and Sen. Tom Sullivan of Centennial, all Democrats, voted with their party to blow up Colorado's long-standing law, which ensured a predictable, statewide approach to firearm regulation. Senate Bill 21-256, passed by Democrats, created a patchwork of local gun laws that create confusion for law-abiding gun owners. The change in the law did not change the behavior of gun-toting criminals, but that is not the goal of the modern Democrat 'blame the guns' approach to governance. Purportedly libertarianish Democrat Gov. Jared Polis signed the bill into law without hesitation.\\nSB 21-256 made clear that the General Assembly believes that '[o]fficials of local governments are uniquely equipped to make determinations as to regulations necessary in their local jurisdictions' and 'to make determinations as to where concealed handguns can be carried in their local jurisdictions \\u2026.'\\nLess than 30 months later \\u2014 and without data to support a change \\u2014 Jacquez Lewis, Kolker and Sullivan have changed their minds and now believe that local governments are too stupid to determine what laws are necessary in their communities and untrustworthy to determine where concealed handguns can be carried. No legislator has yet explained what happened to the 'uniquely equipped' local governments. Once again, Democrats show up to save the day with a solution in search of a problem.\\nSans data \\u2014 let alone new data justifying the need for change \\u2014 the bill drafters hijack local control of the regulation of firearms at parks, playgrounds, rec centers, stadiums for any sport and at every level of competition, amusement parks, carnivals, circuses, water parks, and any property in any way connected to local government \\u2014 or the grounds next to it. No joke.\\nThis bill draft is the equivalent of the energy-company-crushing setbacks for oil rigs in Colorado. Remember that one? The proposed ballot measure excluded drilling from so many places by creating setbacks from so many sensitive areas that oil production could have lawfully only occurred in Weld County Sheriff Steve Reams' driveway and nowhere else.\\nThis bill draft seeks to push Colorado toward becoming a statewide 'sensitive space.'\\nCurrent law prohibits the open carrying of firearms at a polling place, because it 'may intimidate, threaten, or coerce voters \\u2026' The new law prohibits concealed carrying of weapons \\u2014 for the same reasons. To be clear: these gun-hating Dem lawmakers believe that voters might become intimidated, threatened, scared to death, or worse by firearms they cannot see and do not know are there.\\nAfter the 'property owners suck' approach of the special legislative session last year, this year's legislature and Polis continue their assault on private property rights with this bill.\\nThis would-be legislation would ban carrying firearms at numerous private businesses, organizations and on private property, to include: private colleges; churches, synagogues, or other places of worship\\u2014 unless expressly authorized; private nursing homes; any private hospital or place at which medical or health care services are provided, and others.\\nThe most insidious and potentially life-threatening provision of the law is the intended elimination of local school districts \\u2018authority to protect the children in their charge. For 20 years, rural districts across Colorado \\u2014 the ones with schools that are 25+ minutes from law enforcement response to emergencies \\u2014 have had the ability to provide an on-site, immediate response through highly-trained school faculty. Faculty Administrator Safety Training and Emergency Response (FASTER) has trained more than 400 people to carry concealed in their schools across 41 districts in Colorado. The participating schools and school districts have eagerly jumped on the opportunity to better protect their students and faculty. But that is not enough, when it comes to those who hate guns.\\nDespite not a single bad incident having occurred in the seven years FASTER has been training faculty, the Dems under the gold dome appear poised to eliminate it as an option for those communities whose law enforcement protectors are relative eons away.\\nWhat could be the penalty for the commission of such damming acts with firearms at sensitive places? In 2021, a concealed carry holder who ran afoul of local gun regulations faced only a civil penalty of no more than $50. The new bill \\u2014 by the same folks who voted in the 2021 bill \\u2014 ups the ante to a criminal misdemeanor and a $250 fine \\u2014 500% more than the just-enacted bill. There is a bigger question here: If carrying concealed in places prohibited by local or state law is a matter of such supreme importance, that \\u2014 as the bill claims \\u2014 it is 'necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace,' why a small fine? Why no chance for jail \\u2014 and there is none \\u2014 no matter how many times the law is violated? The answer is obvious. The Democrats in the Legislature (and Jared Polis) hate guns and do not value the Second Amendment. Instead, they take every opportunity to chisel away at that right.\\nWhether this draft bill becomes official, the one constant in Colorado's experience with Democrat dominant rule in state government is that the gun-hating ends always justify the hypocritical means when it comes to hating firearms and infringing on Second Amendment rights.\\nGeorge Brauchler is the former district attorney for the 18th Judicial District.

Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nIn a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays.\\n\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\\n\\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. \\u2014 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.\\n\\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.\\n\\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago.\\n\\nMark Guttridge, farmer and co-owner at Ollin Farms, feeds the chickens. The farm benefits from a county program that helps small growers get their produce to more people. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level.\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n\\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n\\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n\\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n\\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2014 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n\\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health.\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2014 many of mixed immigration status \\u2014 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand.\\n\\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n\\nTHANKS TO OUR SPONSOR: Become a Sponsor\\n\\nRelated: Oregon's \\u014dkta restaurant takes farm-to-table one step further\\n\\nWin, win, win\\n\\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill.\\n\\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains.\\n\\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n\\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right.\\n\\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n\\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach.\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition.\\n\\n\\n\\nA force for good\\n\\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n\\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n\\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets. Rachel Woolf / Rachel Woolf for NPR\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n\\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n\\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people.\\n\\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n\\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2014 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.\\n\\nCopyright 2024 NPR.

      "            \"summary\": \"A 36-year-old Colorado man was killed over the weekend in a skydiving accident after both his primary and reserve parachutes failed to deploy.\\n\\nOfficials said the death occurred at around 3:27 p.m. Saturday near the Longmont Airport \\u2014 about 40 miles north of Denver \\u2014 and that the man was wearing a wingsuit at the time of his death. The Federal Aviation Administration was notified of the incident, but they did not respond to the scene.\\n\\n\\nFind Population on Map\\n\\n\\nThe identity of the victim, who was from a mountain community near Denver, has been withheld pending notification of next of kin. The Longmont Police Department and the Boulder County Coroner's Office will be working with the FAA as the investigation continues.\\n\\nLongmont Public Safety said the plane the man jumped out of was operated by Mile High Skydiving. The city has brought up concerns in the past about the company's safety record after several fatal incidents, including the death of a 23-year-old man in 2018. However, skydiving is regulated through the FAA and because of that, the city is limited on what action it can take.\\n\\nOther deaths connected to the company include a July 2022 incident and a June 2019 dive, according to FAA records. The company's website says it has been in business since 1995 and is based out of the Longmont Airport.\\n\\nThis story was originally published by Robert Garrison at Scripps News Denver.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. \\n \\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. \\u2014 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips. \\n \\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds. \\n \\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon. \\n \\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \\n \\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \\n \\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n \\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop. \\n \\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\" \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\\n \\n\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on. \\n \\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2014 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\" \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.\\n \\n\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \\n \\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2014 many of mixed immigration status \\u2014 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \\n \\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be. \\n \\nWin, win, win\\n \\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \\n \\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains. \\n \\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons. \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.\\n \\n\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \\n \\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says. \\n \\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \\n \\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \\n \\nA force for good\\n \\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery. \\n \\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says. \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.\\n \\n\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\" \\n \\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says. \\n \\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \\n \\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\" \\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2014 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food. \\nPhotography by Rachel Woolf.

(Courtesy photo)\\n\\n\\n'I remember the first training I got sent to, and it was required, was Time Management,' Eyl said. 'I was, like, \\u2018They're only sending me to this so they can get more out of me. They just want to extract more.''\\n\\n\\nEyl quickly realized that all the data and analysis GE was amassing from its trainings missed the very important fact that 'companies are a bunch of people.'\\n\\n\\n'I went through a few different related disciplines before I finally got to workplace culture as the place where I really focus,' he said. 'All of it is about humans at the center of the conversation about work.'\\n \\nAs a speaker, coach and consultant, Eyl has long focused on what he calls 'humancentricity' \\u2014 often telling employers to make work 'more than just another four-letter word' by genuinely caring about work/life balance and buying into Eyl's conviction that 'work is an intrinsically human activity.'\\n\\n\\nOn Friday, Eyl will add 'author' to his impressive list of titles, when his debut book, 'Stop Engaging Employees: Start Making Work More Human' is released.\\u00a0The first draft was written over just seven days during the stressful month of November 2020, and then completed last year.\\n \\n'The first version of the book was, \\u2018Here's how you can create a great culture so that you can be more profitable, be more productive,' all those things,' Eyl said. 'This version of the book is, \\u2018Here's how to create a workplace culture that takes care of humans,' because that's all that matters, and the rest of the stuff will take care of itself. There are plenty of books out there that can tell you how to be more profitable and more productive.'\\n\\n\\n'Stop Engaging Employees: Start Making Work More Human,' by Boulder author Eryc Eyl hits bookshelves on Friday. (Courtesy photo)\\n\\n\\nEyl is a public speaker, known in part for emceeing stages at Colorado music festivals, and talking to businesses about adding humanity to workplace culture. He's been a music journalist and critic, penning 'Steal This Track' column for the Denver Post. Now he's excited for the world to know him as a book author.\\n\\n\\n'There's the thing where you make your greatest contribution,' he said, 'the thing that you're good at, and then there's the thing that you enjoy.'\\n\\n\\nEyl said, with a smile, that it's special 'when you have that overlap of those things, and for me speaking and writing are those things.'\\n\\n\\nPerhaps the centerpiece of 'Stop Engaging Employees' is Eyl's signature collection of 'The Six Es' he finds crucial to workplace culture: empathize, encourage, educate, enable, empower and embrace. You might notice there's nothing about profit on that list, and Eyl hopes you read his book and transform the culture in whatever profession in which you take part.\\n\\n\\n'There's an element of, you can read my book as a leadership book,' he said, 'or you can read my book as freaking activism, because there's an element of that. We need real change to be able to take care of each other.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"When one thinks of a 'Hollywood artist,' what typically comes to mind are images of Elizabeth Taylor holding an Oscar or Alfred Hitchcock in a director's chair. (Or, if you're my mom, Chris Hemsworth in a tuxedo.)\\n\\n\\nWhile Longmont-based Ryan Brown doesn't have sultry violet eyes or a contract with Marvel, he has gained a reputation as one of the more sought-after creatives in Hollywood for his work as an 'invisible artist' \\u2014 also known as a film editor.\\n\\n\\nRyan Brown poses for a portrait at his home in Longmont on Jan. 9. Brown was the editor for 'Self Reliance,' a movie streaming on Hulu that stars Andy Samberg, Jake Johnson, Anna Kendrick and Christopher Lloyd. It was edited entirely in Longmont by Brown, a 2001 CU grad who recently moved back to Colorado from Los Angeles. (Cliff Grassmick/Staff Photographer)\\n\\n\\nAnd though it may seem rather rude to call Brown 'invisible,' in the case of film editing, it's a compliment \\u2014 film editors spend hundreds of hours choosing screen transitions, adding sudden sounds, quick-cuts and off-screen audio to weave footage into a cohesive, easy-to-follow narrative. And for viewers, that hard work is meant to go unnoticed.\\n\\n\\nChristopher Osborn, a University of Colorado Boulder Cinema Studies post-production professor \\u2014\\u00a0 who taught Brown as an undergraduate student \\u2014 explained it best:\\n\\n\\n'As an editor, if you're very good at your craft, your imprint on a film should be invisible,' Osborn said. 'You don't want audiences to know that the material has been manipulated in any way. You want the whole thing to be a seamless experience.'\\n\\n\\nIn some cases, a film editor is selected before cast members or screenwriters, and in others, the film editor is asked to be on set with a director to help organize the flow of a shoot. In the way that some directors constantly use the same actors (think Wes Anderson and Bill Murray), some directors also choose to work with the same editors, knowing that the work of a skilled editor can make or break any film.\\n \\nBrown, who graduated from CU's film program in 2001, has become the preferred editor for many directors and producers, including Jeff Baena ('Horse Girl,' 'Joshy,' 'I Heart Huckabees' \\u2014 or, Aubrey Plaza's husband), Tim Robinson ('I Think You Should Leave,' 'Detroiters') and most recently, Jake Johnson ('New Girl').\\n\\n\\nFrom the comfort of his home studio in Longmont, Brown recently edited the entirety of Johnson's new film, 'Self Reliance.' The movie, which was released on Hulu on Jan. 14, is Johnson's directorial debut. The comedy-thriller follows the story of a middle-aged man named Tommy (Jake Johnson) who is invited into a limo by famous actor Andy Samberg, where Tommy's drab life takes a dramatic turn.\\n \\nThe film is charming, engaging, a little dark and a little nutty. While several funny moments come from Johnson's innate charm and comedic chemistry with the other cast members, a good portion of the laugh-out-loud moments seem to be found in the various montages of Tommy's day-to-day life and jump-cuts of close-up facial expressions that were arranged by Brown. For a directorial debut, 'Self Reliance' is impressive \\u2014 but perhaps owes some of its success to Brown's deft hand.\\n\\n\\n'Anything you watch on TV has been manipulated by an editor,' Osborn said, with a laugh. 'If you've ever gone out and shot your own stuff, and you play it back, you look like a dork. Editors help people not look like dorks. And that's really what it comes down to. There's no difference between a professional actor or some 13 year old with a webcam. An editor can make either one look badass.'\\n\\n\\nWhen gearing up to watch a couple of scenes from Brown's extensive resume, the research task turned into viewing 300 minutes of film that Brown edited \\u2014 totally on accident but with absolutely no regrets.\\n\\n\\nThroughout his impressive film reel, Brown's editing constantly weaves together a flawless storyline, creating moments that are sometimes hilarious, sometimes tense, sometimes jarring \\u2014 but always engaging. This same mastery can be seen in 'Self Reliance' where, despite the film's goofy characters, not a single one of them looks like \\u2014 in the professor's words \\u2014 a dork.\\n\\n\\nWe caught up with Brown to learn what it was like to make the move from Los Angeles to Longmont, make a film with Jake Johnson and how it feels to see his work on the big screen.\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nSo it seems like every successful person in Hollywood has a story of their big break. What was yours?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n It's been a long road. I graduated from CU in 2001, and I always knew I wanted to focus on editing. I moved to L.A. two weeks after 9/11, which was a super cool time to be getting a job. And I didn't really know anyone, so I got a job working in a post-production facility in Burbank, basically where my job was to receive actual film canisters and file them away and bring them up to the colorists upstairs. One night, I was working a graveyard shift, from like 8 p.m. to 6 a.m., and this guy came in with a big stack of film from 'The Simpsons' \\u2014 and remember thinking to myself, 'OK, I picked the right job.'\\n\\n\\nI eventually worked my way up in that company and did some editing on the side. One of my colleagues, Nick Jasenovec, started doing some directing on the side, and he happened to be friends with this guy named Bill Hader from community college. We did some short films together, and Nick ended up getting some money to make a film called 'Paper Heart.' We ended up getting Michael Cera on board, and we got that film into Sundance in 2009. So that was my first big break.\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nWhat drew you to film editing?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n I used to make skateboard videos. I had a camera, back before non-linear editing existed. In the early days of making videos, I was literally hooking up two VHS players together, hitting play on one, and hitting record on the other and mashing together these horrible skate videos. But it also taught me that I could tell a story in all of these different ways, using the same source material.\\n\\n\\nWhen I went to CU, it used to be more of an experimental-based sort of program, so we weren't making narrative kinds of films. It was a whole lot of stuff like putting paint or leaves or scratching up film negatives and running them through the projector. It was a very weird, unconventional film school, but it gave me a different outlook on what film could be, as opposed to something I would have learned at a traditional film school. It was just fun and weird and goofy and opened my eyes to my creative side.\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nHow was that move for you, going from a major entertainment hub like Los Angeles to a more quiet, slow-paced town like Longmont?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n In March of 2020, I was working on a show called 'The Other Two' on HBO, and then COVID came and everything shut down, but we were able to quickly switch to editing remotely. Nobody knew what they were doing or how to go about it, but over the course of the next few years, things caught up and we figured it out.\\n\\n\\nI love Los Angeles, but my wife and I were considering a move. We have two young kids, and we saw the pandemic as an opportunity to make that change.\\n\\n\\nIt's so funny \\u2014 since the move, I would be working with some famous people on the computer\\u2026like Jake Johnson or the guys from The Lonely Island would hop on a Zoom call to talk to me and give me notes, and it would be like I was back there in L.A. Then I would log off, and it would be a bit weird to go out and eat dinner with my family on main street in Longmont. It is this weird kind of dichotomy, still having one foot in the door in Los Angeles and one in a small town like Longmont.\\n\\n\\n'Self Reliance,' edited by Longmont's Ryan Brown, follows middle-aged man (Jake Johnson) on the ride of his life when he's invited into a limo by famous actor Andy Samberg. Then it takes some weird turns. (Courtesy of Hulu)\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nWhat was that like, working with Jake Johnson on his very first film as a director? Was it nerve-wracking?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n I've known Jake for a long time. We met (working) on 'Paper Heart' \\u2014 he was the protagonist in that film, so he and I have known each other since 2008. We hadn't worked together professionally much in between that time, but we kind of reconnected a couple of years ago. With first-time directors, trying to establish a rapport with them can be kind of tricky. You're working very intimately with one person for months on end, and sometimes it can be difficult if you don't vibe with the director or they don't vibe with you. But as it turns out, Jake was an incredibly collaborative director, and he's always open to me trying new ideas. He was excellent to work with and was always pushing me to try new things.\\n\\n\\nIn working with Jake \\u2014 we were very meticulous. We showed cuts of the film to friends, and to colleagues, and kept refining and refining. We had four or five test screenings to see what people were responding to, or not responding to. It was hundreds of hours of footage, and having to make a million choices. Movies can really, really change in the editing process. You can have a great script and you can completely ruin it with a horribly edited film, or vice-versa \\u2014 you can have a weak script, and you can elevate the storytelling in the editing process.\\n\\n\\nFor Jake to have directed, filmed and written the film was unique \\u2014 but he was very professional, being able to sit there and critique his own performances in a way that was constructive for the story without letting any kind of ego get in the way was pretty cool to witness.\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nBefore the film was released on Hulu, there was a limited one-night premiere in theaters on Jan. 3. Did you go watch the film?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n Yeah, I did! I got a bunch of friends and we all went to see it at the AMC Flatiron Crossing in Broomfield.\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nThat's amazing! What was that like?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n To me, editing films can be kind of a solitary task \\u2014 you're sitting there in a room by yourself a lot of the time. To be able to watch it in a theater was one of the best feelings because you finally get to see how all of the jokes are landing, or how they're not landing. I had been working on this film for over a year and a half, so it's nice to finally have it out in the world for people to see.\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nWith this film, was there any performances in particular that you had fun bringing to life onscreen?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n Yes. Christopher Lloyd is in this movie briefly \\u2014 you know, the guy from 'Back to the Future'? He is an absolute legend. I don't want to give away too much, because his character is in a very pivotal scene in the movie, but it was so cool to be able to cut his performance together and make it all make sense. It was one of the most challenging scenes to edit, but absolutely the most rewarding, just because Christopher Lloyd is such a legendary figure in this industry. I really hope I did him justice.\\n\\n\\nQ:\\n It feels like your career has come full circle \\u2014 starting in Colorado, going out to L.A., and now coming back \\u2014 what advice would you give to the freshly graduated Ryan?\\n\\n\\nA:\\n The best advice that I give to people who want to get into the industry is that if you want to get ahead in Hollywood, you just gotta get out and start making stuff. That's what I did!\\n\\n\\nQ: \\nMaybe you should go teach a class or two at CU.\\n\\n\\nA:\\n I have a secret desire to teach a class or two at CU if they'll have me. I feel like that would be something that I could help students out with. There's not a ton of people like me wandering around the Front Range, and I would love to just help students get out there and get comfortable making stuff. That's the best way to do it.\\n\\n\\n'Self Reliance' is now streaming on Hulu.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"About 60 reproductive rights supporters gathered signatures and spoke out at a rally at Sixth Avenue Plaza Saturday as part of an effort to enshrine and expand abortion access in Colorado.\\n\\nThe rally came on what would have been the 51st anniversary of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which gave people in the United States the constitutional right to an abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade in 2022.\\n\\nSupporters signed the statewide ballot initiative aimed at protecting abortion rights from government interference. Initiative 89 \\u2013 which is being led by the Colorado Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice Coalition \\u2013 proposes an amendment to the Colorado constitution recognizing the right to an abortion. It also calls for abortion to be a service covered under health insurance for state and local government employees.\\n\\nAcross the state, supporters have a statewide goal to gather 185,000 signatures by April 25.\\n\\nIn nearby Boulder, people gathered at a similar event in front of the Boulder County Courthouse at 1325 Pearl St. organized by YWCA Boulder County.\\n\\n'It's important to have collecting points where we all come together\\u2026and lift different voices that are really important to hear in our community,' said Debbie Pope, chief executive officer of YWCA Boulder County. 'But it always has to happen alongside the action that needs to happen.'\\n\\nYWCA Boulder County volunteers gathered signatures from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., both from rally participants and mall pedestrians.\\n\\n'I think it's a great launch, and I think every person that was here today is going to tell five, 10 more of their friends,' Pope said.\\n\\nAt the Boulder rally, four speakers took the microphone to encourage guests to sign the initiative and to share what else people can do to advocate for reproductive freedom.\\n\\nState Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis, who represents Boulder, Weld and Broomfield counties, mentioned the Colorado legislature's passage of the Reproductive Health Equity Act in 2022 along with three bills protecting reproductive rights last year.\\n\\n'Now, we have to go a step further, and that's what this petition is about,' Lewis said. 'Let's get out there and keep Colorado safe and a state where everyone can get the health care that they need.'\\n\\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder alumni Dani Newsum, who works for the Denver-based abortion advocacy group Cobalt, called Colorado a 'beacon of hope' for reproductive freedoms. She also mentioned the novelty of the effort to expand abortion rights to more health insurance plans.\\n\\n'It's about access, it's about fairness,' Newsum said. 'Colorado is the only state that's doing it. So, once again, we're leading the way.'\\n\\nMany rally participants listened to the speakers while holding signs with slogans of support for the petition and reproductive rights, including ones that read 'Mother By Choice,' 'BoCo Dems Support Reproductive Freedom,' and 'Healthcare Not Handcuffs.'\\n\\nCara Wong, a Fairview High School senior, talked about her frustration with seeing Roe v. Wade overturned while she was still too young to vote. Now, at 18, Wong said she has recognized the power that comes with voting.\\n\\n'Worrying about the laws about the rights to my own body should not be something that occupies my mind, nor should future generations have to do what I am currently doing,' Wong said.\\n\\nUniversity of Colorado senior Nimisha Mallela spoke about the positive impact of the university's decision to offer free emergency contraceptives on campus, which started last year.\\n\\n'The urgency for readily available and accessible reproductive healthcare has never been greater,' Mallela said. 'This is a fight begun by great women before us, and will be a fight continued for the great women that come after us.'\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"More than 100 reproductive rights supporters gathered signatures and spoke out at a rally on Boulder's Pearl Street Mall Saturday as part of an effort to enshrine and expand abortion access in Colorado.\\n\\n\\nPeople signed a statewide ballot initiative aimed at protecting abortion rights from government interference in front of the Boulder County Courthouse at 1325 Pearl St. The event was organized by \\nYWCA Boulder County.\\n\\n\\n'It's important to have collecting points where we all come together\\u2026and lift different voices that are really important to hear in our community,' said Debbie Pope, chief executive officer of YWCA Boulder County. 'But it always has to happen alongside the action that needs to happen.'\\n\\n\\nInitiative 89\\n \\u2013 which is being led by the \\nColorado Reproductive Health, Rights and Justice Coalition\\n \\u2013 proposes an amendment to the Colorado constitution recognizing the right to an abortion. It also calls for abortion to be a service covered under health insurance for state and local government employees.\\n\\n\\nYWCA Boulder County volunteers gathered signatures from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., both from rally participants and mall pedestrians. Another rally was held at the same time in downtown Longmont to collect signatures for the initiative.\\n\\n\\nYWCA Boulder County was an early supporter of the initiative and timed Saturday's rally around what would have been the 51st anniversary of the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision, which gave people in the United States the constiutional right to an abortion. The U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe V. Wade in 2022. Pope said the Boulder rally's turnout likely led to around 2,500 new signatures, contributing to the statewide goal of 185,000 signatures by April 25.\\n \\n'I think it's a great launch, and I think every person that was here today is going to tell five, 10 more of their friends,' Pope said.\\n\\n\\nAt the Boulder rally, four speakers took the microphone to encourage guests to sign the initiative and to share what else people can do to advocate for reproductive freedom.\\n \\nState Sen. Sonya Jaquez Lewis, who represents Boulder, Weld and Broomfield counties, mentioned the Colorado legislature's passage of the Reproductive Health Equity Act in 2022 along with three bills protecting reproductive rights last year.\\n\\n\\n'Now, we have to go a step further, and that's what this petition is about,' Lewis said. 'Let's get out there and keep Colorado safe and a state where everyone can get the health care that they need.'\\n\\n\\nUniversity of Colorado Boulder alumni Dani Newsum, who works for the Denver-based abortion advocacy group \\nCobalt\\n, called Colorado a 'beacon of hope' for reproductive freedoms. She also mentioned the novelty of the effort to expand abortion rights to more health insurance plans.\\n\\n\\n'It's about access, it's about fairness,' Newsum said. 'Colorado is the only state that's doing it. So, once again, we're leading the way.'\\n\\n\\nMany rally participants listened to the speakers while holding signs with slogans of support for the petition and reproductive rights, including ones that read 'Mother By Choice,' 'BoCo Dems Support Reproductive Freedom,' and 'Healthcare Not Handcuffs.'\\n\\n\\nCara Wong, a Fairview High School senior, talked about her frustration with seeing Roe v. Wade overturned while she was still too young to vote. Now, at 18, Wong said she has recognized the power that comes with voting.\\n\\n\\n'Worrying about the laws about the rights to my own body should not be something that occupies my mind, nor should future generations have to do what I am currently doing,' Wong said.\\n\\n\\nUniversity of Colorado senior Nimisha Mallela spoke about the positive impact of the university's decision to offer free emergency contraceptives on campus, which started last year.\\n\\n\\n'The urgency for readily available and accessible reproductive healthcare has never been greater,' Mallela said. 'This is a fight begun by great women before us, and will be a fight continued for the great women that come after us.'\",\n",

The first paragraph stated some good things the Boulder Police Department has done. Then you said the city set a poor example by choosing Deputy Chief Redfearn as interim chief. You stated that you were not questioning the qualification or character of Redfearn, but spent the next ten paragraphs presenting the NAACP's complaints/concerns of him. What are his qualifications? What were Chief Harold's recommendations for an interim chief? If the chief leaves would you not expect the deputy chief to step in as interim chief? The whole editorial was basically the NAACP's view. Not much transparency nor support for the police department.

With the news being as lousy and as scary as it has become these days, I can honestly say that the puzzle page is a big part of the reason I subscribe. I have always particularly enjoyed solving the Cryptoquote. Often the solutions were wise sayings that I would think about for a bit, so it was a little reward. You've recently replaced the Cryptoquote with the Cryptoquip. I'm really sorry to say this, but the Cryptoquips are just plain dumb. It's barely worth the time and effort to solve them they are so stupid. I very much hope that you'll be open to reversing course and going back to the Cryptoquote puzzles. I can't be the only person who feels this way. Thanks for your attention.\\n\\nBetty Jones, Boulder\\n\\nCostco-Citibank partnership is environmentally, morally troubling\\n\\nCostco's credit card partnership with Citibank has resulted in significant environmental consequences. Since 2016, Citibank has invested a staggering $332 billion in new fossil fuel investments. This funding has contributed to climate-driven catastrophes worldwide as emissions from dirty energy continue to warm our planet with dire consequences.\\n\\nFor the past 20 years, significant portions of Colorado have experienced drought, and the Colorado River is in peril. This river provides water for 40 million people in seven states. We've experienced the devastating impacts of climate change locally with our 2013 flood and the 2021 horrific Marshall Fire. Last July was the hottest month in recorded history in Colorado. Climatologists say 2023's extreme heat is the product of a long-term warming trend caused by climate change.\\n\\nCostco is the third-largest retailer in the U.S. and a big client of Citibank's. Costco has the power to persuade Citibank to switch its funding from dirty to clean energy.\\n\\nCostco considers itself an ethical company with strong values. They are doing some good things like paying employees well, agreeing to reduce plastic packaging, selling more organic food and switching to cage-free eggs. An ethical company should not do business with an unethical corporate partner like Citibank. There are other climate-friendly credit card company options.\\n\\nCostco has the opportunity to be a leader among large retailers by addressing the climate impacts of its banking relationships. They should follow their own corporate motto and 'do the right thing' by either using their power to persuade Citibank to clean up its investing or choose a better credit card banking partner.\\n\\nShari Malloy, Longmont\",\n",

I am really struggling with internet. Please, I need it!!\\n\\n\\nWilliam Ryan, age 8, Boulder\\n \\nStop spraying poison on crops\\n\\n\\nLots of animals are becoming endangered because of poison that is sprayed on crops, fields and near playgrounds. If an animal eats a plant with poison on it, it will die, and another animal will eat it, causing the other animal to die as well. Also, some animals are seen as pests and are hunted until they go extinct. This happened to many animals, such as the Carolina parakeet.\\n\\n\\nAlina Beard, age 9, Erie\\n \\nTransition to biodegradable materials\\n\\n\\nI live in Boulder, Colorado. I want you to stop using so much plastic and use biodegradable materials instead. I think it is a problem because the world is filling up with plastic. I know the alternative is more expensive but it would be better to use less plastic. I want you to try to make more businesses in Colorado use biodegradable materials instead. Thank you so much for your time.\\n \\nWinston Plummer, age 10, Boulder\\n \\nLet more animals into Boulder\\n\\n\\nI want you to let more nature and animals into Boulder. I live in Nederland. In Ned, there are a lot of animals. But when I go to Boulder there are barely any. I want there to be more protected areas of nature for more animals. It would be better for the animals and for us. Some people might be scared of having bears or mountain lions in their neighborhoods, but you can talk to them and tell them to come up to Ned and talk to us.\\n \\nCan you please write me back?\\n\\n\\nLiv Martin, age 10, Nederland\\n \\nLittering is out of control\\n\\n\\nMy name is Auden. Now, you're probably wondering why I am sending you this letter. Well, I would like to bring attention to the amount that we are littering. This has always been a problem, but in these past few years, it has gotten out of control. Now let me tell you what I mean. You go to parks and you see trash. One day you want to go explore in nature. But you get there and there is trash and then it doesn't feel as special as it should. You are probably wondering why I am so frustrated about this. You see, my favorite animal is a sea turtle. But let's say you take a trip along the beaches of Florida, and you go down to the beach, but it is not a pretty sight. There is trash everywhere, and then you see the turtles come up stuck in trash or eating trash because they just think that it is food. It is not just the sea turtles. It is also other sea creatures. But if this is really such a problem then why have we not brought it to people's attention? Well, we are not the ones getting hurt so we don't care about littering. I think we should start working on this problem because if you think that this problem will take a month, then you are wrong. After we finally start figuring out that this is a problem then we first have to remove all of the trash and then we need some laws so that people do not continue to litter.\\n\\n\\nThank you for taking the time to read this letter. I hope that we can start to save the sea turtles and other sea creatures.\\n\\n\\nAuden Schrader, age 10, Boulder\\n \\nRoads need reflective lines\\n\\n\\nI think you should change this problem. When I lived in Arizona it rained a decent amount. The roads in Arizona have reflective lines to show where the lanes are. Once I moved here when it rained I could barely see the lines on the road, which made it very hard to drive, which probably leads to more crashes. I live in Erie. My name is Briella Butters. I think due to Colorado's weather this would help a lot. I mean we could always have fewer crashes! I think having reflective or grippy street lines would be better and easier for everyone to drive safely when the roads are wet. Hundreds of car crashes happen every day. I think fixing this would help a lot! I am not sure what you think about this. I would love it if you could reply. Thank you for your time!\\n\\n\\nBriella Butters, age 10, Erie\\n \\nClose Main St. to cars again\\n\\n\\nI am a 10-year-old resident of Louisville, Colorado. I am writing this letter to say that I have recently been thinking how, almost four years ago, back when the COVID-19 outbreak started, you had closed down Main Street for automobiles, and, at the same time, opened it for pedestrian traffic. I remember how, back then, my dad, who is an artist, and I were painting one of the wooden chairs that lined the street. Then, almost a year later, I remember sitting with my mom in one of those chairs, sharing a bowl of shaved ice and talking together and laughing. Today, I am thinking, what if we did that again? I remember that back when you opened the street to cars again I felt sad and wished that it would close again, and now I want to fulfill that wish. We could possibly arrange something with seasonal closures, or even something with the alley behind the library? Please reply to me sometime!\\n\\n\\nSienna J. Fields, age 10, Louisville\\n \\nWe can solve homelessness\\n\\n\\nLately, people experiencing homelessness have been a big problem throughout Boulder. I live in east Boulder and every time I leave to go somewhere I almost always see people experiencing homelessness. I believe that you can find a way to get rid of the giant problem of people experiencing homelessness without hurting or forcing anyone out of Boulder. Thank you for your time.\\n\\n\\nLovecloud Lemley, age 11, Boulder\\n \\nPause building apartments\\n\\n\\nI hope this finds you in a good mood, or else I'm screwed. I live in Longmont, Colorado, close to beautiful McIntosh Lake, and I see a major problem in the surrounding cities, and also Longmont. We are blessed to live in a beautiful state with gorgeous mountains. What I'm writing to you about is the rise in apartment buildings. Back in 2018, before COVID, some apartments and other businesses were built on the east side of Hover. I was a bumbling five-year-old and didn't think much about it. Then two or three years ago, they sold the property on the west side of Hover, which used to be a beautiful field with an amazing backdrop of our mountains. Soon the field was cleared and the view disappeared. In Boulder, in the city, you feel like an ant.\\n\\n\\nMy solution: pause building for any apartments and wait for all the already-built apartments to be occupied. Once the built apartments have been occupied for two months, see if the need for more housing is still needed. If it is not, turn the unfinished apartment buildings into green spaces. Thank you for your time.\\n\\n\\nYolilizatl Olvera, age 11, Longmont\\n \\nBuses should be free\\n\\n\\nMy name is Mara, and I live in Broomfield, Colorado. I think that the bus is an amazing thing, and idea, but I also think it could be better. I'm writing this letter from the top of a high hill, looking down at Boulder. There's a dirty brown haze of pollution.\\n\\n\\nThe bus, a wondrous thing, takes me from here to there. Something that even lets kids ride for free. But you know what would be even better, even more amazing? Imagine, close your eyes, and picture a bus where people of all ages could ride for free. Kids, adults, teens, all riding the bus. Now open your eyes and think, what if that could be real?\\n\\n\\nI know that I for one would much rather ride for free than pay. I would also ride a lot more. And if more people rode the bus than drove, climate change would go down a lot, too! And that helps the whole planet. Making the bus free would also help people who don't have as much money get around, and people who are unhoused could get to places where they can get help. And all that needs to happen to make all of that is just making the bus free. I know that if that was to happen the bus wouldn't get money, but maybe it could be paid by taxes?\\n\\n\\nI hope you will think about it. Thanks for your time!\\n\\n\\nMara Kammersell, age 11, Broomfield\\n \\nClimate change must be top policy\\n\\n\\nClose your eyes, imagine a world without smoke, the fear of fire, and a world that isn't dry and flammable. Imagine a world where kids would not have to miss school because of asthma or lung problems, and how the air would be clean, free of smoke. Now open your eyes, and believe that we could make that true by putting climate change at the top of policy decisions and preparing our community to defend against fire. With carbon emissions soaring, the planet is getting hotter; therefore, it's a perfect climate for wildfires to sprout. Personally, I know numerous victims of the Marshall Fire, and while I luckily was not one of them, I witnessed the damage, loss and destruction that the fire did to the communities of Boulder County. After the fire, I realized how destructive fire is, and that I want to play my part to try and stop it.\\n\\n\\nThere are numerous things that local governments could do immediately to help stop this problem. Local governments could incentivize people with free bus fares to reduce carbon emissions, invest in electric vehicles and encourage people to use solar panels. Reducing carbon emissions would not only help reduce fires, but would help slow climate change.\\n\\n\\nIn addition to reducing carbon emissions, communities could defend against fire by removing dead and flammable twigs from around houses and properly putting out campfires. Local governments could also invest in new technology like AI-enabled cameras that could scan the horizon for smoke. There are also drones that help detect fires and firefighting robots that can help fight fires. As you can see, there are many creative ways to invest in our future. Thank you for your time.\\n\\n\\nLucia Dougherty, age 11, Boulder\\n \\nPrairie dogs would appreciate more space\\n\\n\\nI hope you are having a wonderful day. I have been living in Boulder for five years and I love all the Open Space, but I have noticed that housing has been taking over prairie dog colonies and open fields, and I am sure the prairie dogs would appreciate more space.\\n\\n\\nSebastien Perarnaud, age 12, Boulder\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nI think that you should preserve more wild lands so that more wild animals have more room to roam. I think that more wild land for us and for the animals would be great. My name is Anya Alston and I live in Jamestown, Colorado. Please write back to me. Thank you for your time and all you do.\\n\\n\\nAnya Alston, age 12, Jamestown\\n \\n\\n\\n\\nMy name is Olive Browne and I live in Boulder. I've been here for almost six years and I would like to bring your attention to my cause. I think that if you tried you could help make more affordable housing in Boulder County. As you probably know, there is a lot of grassland that many owners own but don't use and eventually forget about and sell and it becomes the property of some people who already have many properties in Colorado and they also are not being used. Some families live in a two-bedroom one-bath apartment, or a one-bedroom apartment, with babies and more children. They usually have to pay $5,000 a month and have bills that go off the walls. So all I ask is for you to consider my ask, and I would like a reply if you have time. Thank you.\\n\\n\\nOlive Browne, age 12, Boulder\\n \\nRedo bathrooms at Louisville Middle\\n\\n\\nMy name is Avery, and there is something I want to talk about. You may not know this, but a problem many have is the bathrooms at school. At Louisville Middle School, there are many problems with the stalls. Some totally can't open, or they get stuck. It can also be hard to wash your hands properly because some of the faucets don't work right. However, I think that we can do something about this. We can redo bathrooms and fix it all up. This might help with people's enjoyment of school. I am homeschooled so I don't have this problem myself, but I went into LMS for a karate event and was shocked at the state of the bathrooms. I asked some friends about it and they said that all the bathrooms at LMS are like this. This made me so sad, and I would love it if you could do something about this. Thank you for your time.\\n\\n\\nAvery M. Schrader, age 12, Boulder\\n \\nStop allowing more big buildings\\n\\n\\nI am 13 years old and I live in Boulder, and I would like you to listen to my request. Our house is close to Arapahoe and Cherryvale and a large apartment complex is being built close by. This will cause a lot of traffic because of all the people that will be moving in. Please stop allowing buildings like this as more cars equals more pollution. I hope you can take this into consideration.\\n\\n\\nRoland Plummer, age 13, Boulder\\n \\nBoulder can do more for unhoused\\n\\n\\nI hope this letter finds you in good health. I would like to bring your attention to Boulder's population of people experiencing homelessness. I no longer feel safe walking alone. There was a period of time when I was younger when my family and I were unhoused, so I understand the struggle. I also understand that this is not an easy problem to fix. But I do not believe that it's unfixable. You could build more shelters or provide more mental health help. I do truly hope you consider.\\n\\n\\nThank you for your time. I hope to see your replies.\\n\\n\\nPaloma L. Tavernetti, age 13, Ward\\n \\nPeriod products should be free for all\\n\\n\\nI firmly believe that period products should be accessible for all, including free products that are regularly stocked and including them in\\u00a0\\nall\\n\\u00a0bathrooms. If pads and tampons are free, then anyone will be able to access a necessity whether they have a quarter or not. If they're stocked well, gone will be the days of panic. Having one or two quarters amounts to nothing if the machines are empty!\\n\\n\\nI also believe that they should be in all bathrooms. I would be greatly euphoric if I were able to use the male restroom regardless if I'm menstruating or not.\\n\\n\\nI hope my idea will be taken into consideration. Thank you!\\n\\n\\nCharlie Robinson, age 13, Lafayette\\n \\nStop watering when it rains\\n\\n\\nI am writing about the City of Longmont. Through the years I have noticed that in the spring when it's raining many of the public areas are getting watered by sprinklers. I think that if you stop watering while it's raining you could conserve much more water. I know that it might be hard to stop the whole watering system when it rains. Maybe switching it on later in the spring season would be more reasonable. Please think about this request.\\n\\n\\nAtzintli Olvera, age 13, Longmont\\n \\nEliminate food waste\\n\\n\\nAcross the world, food shortage is a problem. Outside of the U.S., many people wake up hungry in the morning and fall asleep without enough food in their bellies. This connects to some of the populations of people experiencing homelessness around the world. My name is AJ and I'm 13 years old. I live in Boulder County, and I see many camps of people experiencing homelessness each day. My family has traveled to many states outside of Colorado and I've noticed that so many people have no roof over their heads.\\n\\n\\nOne way to prevent food shortage is by eliminating food waste. Tons of people throw away any food that they won't eat, including me. I know it can be difficult, but next time you go to throw food into the trash, remember that you may be throwing away what could have been someone else's meal. Donating any uneaten food to your local food bank makes a difference. Any small step helps. Thank you for your time.\\n\\n\\nAJ Martin, age 13, Nederland\\n \\nFind solutions to homeless crisis\\n\\n\\nI am a Boulder County resident. I would like to address the situation regarding people experiencing homelessness. I have been witnessing homeless people breaking into our homes and stealing from our homes and cars. I see them with multiple bikes. I see them sleeping on the bike paths and on the sidewalks all over town. I ask that you find solutions to this crisis. We are counting on you to make our town safe. I feel this issue has gotten worse over the years, even to the point of biking on the Boulder Creek Path feeling fearful of people attacking or yelling at us.\\n\\n\\nI appreciate your time for reading this. I hope there can be deep change.\\n\\n\\nLeiLani Lemley, Boulder\\n \\nComposting has taken step backward\\n\\n\\nThis spring composting in Boulder County took a major step backward by ceasing to accept paper products. Years ago, the City of Louisville had a program teaching residents to compost our paper towels and Kleenex. I quickly put out a separate wastebasket in the bathrooms, and a lot more of our waste was diverted from the landfill. We already try to limit our use of disposable materials (for example, we use cloth napkins at our meals and microfiber cloths for most of our cleaning), but there are some things like oiling our grill for which I haven't found a suitable substitute for paper towels. Now each time I put them in the trash, it feels extra wasteful.\\n\\n\\nBack before we had curbside composting, we had our own backyard compost bin. I suppose I could go back to that, but I imagine there are so many paper towels from restrooms around the county that used to be diverted to compost and are once again headed to the landfill that this is a much larger problem than my household alone can solve.\\n\\n\\nI understand that all compostables in Boulder County are taken to the same facility, which imposed these new limitations. I hope you're involved in conversations to urge them to accept these items again in the future, or to find a new facility that would be open to taking them, or to consider expanding EcoCycle's role to include composting as well. There must be something better than telling all the restaurants in the county that all of their compostable take-home containers must now be destined for the trash. Please help us return to being as responsible as we were a year ago. Help us send as little as possible the landfill's way.\\n\\n\\nErin Robertson, Louisville\",\n",

(Front Range Passenger Rail Corridor Project Inventory Report)\\n\\n\\nMembers of the board of the Front Range Passenger Rail District board of directors began their first meeting of the year on Friday with this:\\n\\n\\n'This will be a really important year for this project,' said board president James Souby.\\n\\n\\nAn understatement, perhaps.\\n\\n\\nThe board is charged with developing plans for passenger rail service between Fort Collins and Pueblo. It has already decided on the route, which will follow the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railway route north of Denver and the BNSF/Union Pacific line south of Denver.\\n\\n\\nBut 2024 could be a make or break year, because by April the board has to decide whether to ask voters in the district to tax themselves to pay for the development of the line, stations and related investments.\\n\\n\\nTo that end, the district is hiring staff and consultants to help, said Andy Karsian, general manager of the district. It also is lobbying the legislature for funding to augment what taxpayers might decide.\\n \\nWhile a decision on whether to go to the ballot remains four months away, board members did express caution.\\n\\n\\n'It may be better to wait and win instead of rush and lose,' said new Colorado Springs board member Lynette Crow-Iverson. She said that November's ballot this year will be large and have a national focus because of the presidential election and the multiple congressional seats that will be up for voter approval.\\n \\nSouby noted that 'part of the urgency of the question' is that changing political winds could change things after the election.\\n\\n\\n'Expect it to cost more for the campaign if you do it this year,' said Crow-Iverson, suggesting a $1 million price tag for the campaign.\\n\\n\\nSize of the ballot wasn't the only concern. Board members representing the metropolitan area, especially those in the Northwest Corridor of the Regional Transportation District, said their communities have been awaiting results from taxes paid into RTD for FasTracks.\\n\\n\\n'It's important to communicate to the public about the ongoing FasTracks tax and how this fits with passenger rail,' said Longmont mayor Joan Peck.\\n\\n\\nKarsian said that district staff has been negotiating with RTD to see if passenger rail can tap into existing FasTracks savings accounts for rail service in the Northwest Corridor.\\n\\n\\nDebra Johnson, general manager and CEO of RTD, said any decisions on savings accounts would ultimately come down to the RTD board, 'recognizing that there are other unfinished segments' of the FasTracks network.\\n\\n\\nJulie Mullica, representing the Denver Regional Council of Governments on the rail district board, said that board members need to keep in mind that 'there are communities opposed to this because they don't see the benefit. It's important to bring the communities along quickly' with information about the project.\\n\\n\\nNo decisions were made Friday; Karsian was charged with developing a calendar of work with deadlines so that the board can stay on track.\\n\\n\\nThis article was first published by BizWest, an independent news organization, and is published under a license agreement. \\u00a9 2024 BizWest Media LLC.

Five hail from Mead, led by Lyons junior student-athlete Ashley Booth (26-3 record) at 155 pounds. Legacy, likewise, has thrown five of its girls into the mix, with senior Ari Hen (24-5) ranking the highest at No. 5 in the 135-lb. weight class.

To qualify, homebuyers must make less than 100 percent of Broomfield's area median income, which is $124,100 for a family of four. The community's area median income is defined as the midpoint of that area's income distribution. It is calculated annually by the federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.\\n\\n\\nIf approved, the down-payment program would offer eligible homebuyers 30-year deferred loans with 2% annual interest. Loans would be capped at 6% of the purchase price of the home, or $50,000.\\n\\n\\n'We deemed it necessary to provide middle-income earners an opportunity to achieve long-term homeownership at the same time as providing sustainability to the housing division as this down payment is considered a loan that will be paid back,' said Sharon Tessier, housing policy manager.\\n\\n\\nThe down-payment loan program is expected to align with two developments in Broomfield \\u2013 Grand Vue at Interlocken, 471 Interlocken Blvd., near Flatiron Crossing. and Dillon Pointe on Aspen Street near Aspen Creek, city staffers said in the study session.\\n\\n\\nThe program would be administered through a contract with the Colorado Housing Assistance Corp., a nonprofit group that has worked with homebuyers in the state for more than 40 years. Of the proposed $1 million budget, $100,000 would go to CHAC for administrative costs with an additional flat fee for each home sold, according to documents from the study session.\\n \\nCity and county staffers estimate that the proposed budget would serve about 25 homebuyers.

Her son Chayanne Hern\\u00e1ndez, second from right in the back row, served as a mentor to the team.\\n\\nHow do teachers captivate their students? Here, in a feature we call How I Teach, we ask great educators how they approach their jobs.\\n\\nIn second grade, Carlota Loya Hern\\u00e1ndez spent a lot of time coloring at her desk. She didn't speak English and her teacher didn't speak Spanish, so crayons and paper were her go-to activity at school in Colorado's San Luis Valley.\\n\\nBy middle school, things had changed. Loya Hern\\u00e1ndez was taking advanced math and headed for even more advanced coursework in high school. Eventually, she earned her college degree and became a teacher in the Boulder Valley School District.\\n\\nToday, she has a Ph.D. and is a champion for bilingual students, working to ensure they get the educational opportunities they deserve.\\n\\n'The greatest problem in public schools is a lack of responsiveness to the brilliance and incredible talent evident in each and every child, especially bilingual and multilingual children,' she said.\\n\\nCarlota Loya Hern\\u00e1ndez poses for a school photo. (Image courtesy of Carlota Loya Hern\\u00e1ndez)\\n\\nLoya Hern\\u00e1ndez, who is a math and gifted and talented specialist at Escuela Biling\\u00fce Pioneer, a dual language immersion school in Boulder Valley, was named the 2023 bilingual elementary teacher of the year by the Colorado Association of Bilingual Education. She talked to Chalkbeat about how she ensured 100% attendance for parent-teacher conferences, what she told the mother of a class clown, and why she worries about anti-immigrant sentiments.\\n\\nThis interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.\\n\\nWas there a moment when you decided to become a teacher?\\n\\nAs a middle and high school student, I was trained as a peer tutor because my fellow students would often come to me for help. In college, I tutored other students in math and science. I never planned to become a teacher and wanted to become an architectural engineer due to my love of both math and art. But it was my calling.\\n\\nI dropped out of college due to financial hardship and a lack of knowledge about financial aid. I got a job as a restaurant manager and began my career with the Boulder Valley district as a native language tutor. I greatly enjoyed working with immigrant and refugee students who were often ignored or not supported in the mainstream classroom. This angered me and propelled me to go back to college and get a teaching degree.\\n\\nHow did your own experience in school influence your approach to teaching?\\n\\nI remember my first day in second grade in Center Elementary School. We had just moved to the San Luis Valley from Silverton. I had bilingual support in kindergarten and first grade as I was new to the country, but in second grade it was sink or swim. My teacher did not understand me, and I did not understand her. She gave me crayons and let me color. I was happy as could be as I loved art.\\n\\nBy middle school, I was pulled for an advanced math class. I was in advanced language arts, math, and science in high school. As the child of farm workers with few resources at home, the school became a safe haven. I thrived in all my classes, except PE. The only C I received was in PE because I had to dress for class. My father did not allow me to wear shorts nor did I have the means to buy sweatpants.\\n\\n\\n\\nCenter High School opened the door to a world of opportunities and nominated me for the Spud Bowl Scholarship at Adams State College in Alamosa \\u2014 now Adams State University. When I won the full-ride scholarship, it was the key to accessing higher education and a future full of possibilities. It became my ticket out of poverty.\\n\\nTell us about a favorite lesson to teach.\\n\\nI love to develop lessons that really connect with students, impact their thinking, and help them understand important concepts. To teach important math concepts, such as fractions, decimals and percentages, I created a lesson using the book 'If the World Were a Village' by David J. Smith.\\n\\nThe focus was very mathematical, but students were able to analyze the data and come to their own conclusions. The lesson allowed my students to think beyond their own existence in their town, past borders, and to grapple with the grave inequities in educational access, medical care, basic living conditions, such as access to clean water, housing, and sewage, and to imagine the great poverty of so many that are literally starving to death. It allowed us to understand how grateful we should be for all we have in the U.S., how fortunate we are, and the great amount of opportunity we have.\\n\\nWhat is the biggest challenge your bilingual students face?\\n\\nThe systems of oppression in all realms of students' lives. Racist manifestations include dual-language programs tailored to white families. The majority of the students in our district who earn a Seal of Biliteracy, showing that they can read and write in both English and a non-English language, are not heritage speakers of the non-English language.\\n\\nBilingual students continue to be overrepresented in special education, discipline referrals, and alternative schools with technical tracks instead of pre-collegiate programs and AP/IB coursework. They are underrepresented in advanced coursework in all areas, including Spanish. [Often], they are not identified as gifted and talented.\\n\\nThese are the systems I fight against daily. In my three semesters at Escuela Biling\\u00fce Pioneer, we have 25 students in advanced math just in fourth and fifth grades. There were only six students when I started at Pioneer. There are another 30-40 students in the younger grades who are in the pipeline for advanced math.\\n\\nAs a data nerd, I monitor students' progress and identify students that have high ability, in both math and biliteracy (both languages). We are in our third year of the Boulder Universal Advanced Math Program which serves students in fourth and fifth grade.\\n\\nMost district and school leaders do not focus on the high end of achievement. There is an urgency to work on the 'gap,' but, that does little to improve a school. We must develop a mentality of talent development and advanced learning opportunities to raise the bar.\\n\\nWhat unique strengths do you observe in your bilingual students?\\n\\nBilingual/multilingual students are above standard, although the fixation is that they are below grade level. They rise to a higher level of language and overall academic and social achievement. They are the future of our society as they are globally minded citizens and will be the caretakers of the planet. Bilingual/multilingual students have more social conscientiousness in respecting and valuing differences \\u2014 whether it is cultural, linguistic, religious, spiritual, or otherwise.\\n\\nTell us about a memorable time \\u2014 good or bad \\u2014 when contact with a student's family changed your perspective or approach.\\n\\nMy parents were never able to go to my school when I was a child as they worked all day in the lettuce or potato fields and arrived late from work. They had no medical care or benefits, so they could not afford to miss work. As a teacher, I made sure I stayed late and did home visits if necessary to connect with my students' parents. I always aimed for and achieved 100% attendance at my conferences.\\n\\n\\n\\nIn my 30 years as an educator, I never saw a parent that did not care for their child. The idea that parents do not care, that they are ill-equipped to support their child, has cruel and racist underpinnings that contribute to the deficit perspective of students of color, especially immigrant and refugee populations. On the contrary, families have walked across the continent, fled danger and hunger in their home country, leaving everything and everyone behind so they can provide the best opportunity for their child's future.\\n\\nOne time, I called a mom whose son was the class clown. He was a brilliant child who refused to do his work. He was disruptive to the class as he was always off-task and hilarious. The mom answered the phone with, 'What did Mario do now?' She was on speaker phone and both Mario and the class heard her response. I could not help but chuckle a bit as I was calling to congratulate her on how well Mario had done on a test or activity. But that child was and is brilliant. I am sure he is a very successful and highly bilingual citizen contributing to society. He was not compliant at all times but he had incredible potential. It was as obvious as day to me; but not everyone is able to see beyond a student's color, background, or behavior.\\n\\nWhat's something happening in the community that affects what goes on in your classroom?\\n\\nThe anti-immigrant sentiment in this country, police killings of Latinx and Black people, the prison systems that keep parents from their children, the threat of social services, the lack of community resources such as basic housing, food, medical care, a living wage, and safety all impact our students. The election of a president \\u2014 Donald Trump \\u2014 with all of that hate in his speech and actions brought fear and anguish into bilingual schools.\\n\\nStudents were crying as teachers were in shock. I had to stay home that day as I could not deal with the reality of the election. This fear has returned in 2024 as the hate returns to impact every student of color and limit their humanity and threaten the well-being and safety of their families.\\n\\nWhat are you reading for enjoyment?\\n\\n'Punished for Dreaming: How School Reform Harms Black Children and How We Heal' and 'We Want to Do More than Survive,' both by Bettina L. Love. I have become very interested in this type of scholarship that addresses and exposes the root causes of educational and social inequities in schooling and society. This might be the focus for the next phase of my life; to teach the next generation the history of racism and oppression in the U.S. so they can contribute to changing society to be more equitable.\\n\\nAnn Schimke is a senior reporter at Chalkbeat, covering early childhood issues and early literacy.

The city has brought up concerns in the past about the company's safety record after several fatal incidents, including the death of a 23-year-old man in 2018.

      "            \"summary\": \"In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. \\n\\n\\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. \\u2014 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.\\n\\n\\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.\\n\\n\\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n\\n\\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \\n\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \\n\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n\\n\\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n\\n\\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n\\n\\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2014 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \\n\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2014 many of mixed immigration status \\u2014 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \\n\\n\\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n\\n\\nWin, win, win\\n\\n\\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \\n\\n\\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains. \\n\\n\\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \\n\\n\\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n\\n\\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \\n\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \\n\\n\\nA force for good\\n\\n\\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n\\n\\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n\\n\\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n\\n\\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \\n\\n\\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n\\n\\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2014 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food. \\nCopyright 2024 NPR.

      "            \"summary\": \"BROOMFIELD \\u2014\\n Colorado Department of Agriculture Commissioner Kate Greenberg would not say how it felt to watch the first five wolves to arrive in Colorado for reintroduction leave their crates and lope across the snow-covered landscape in Grand County in December.\\u00a0\\n \\nNot one facial expression, hand gesture or inadvertent emotion-revealing eye flick.\\u00a0\\n \\nInstead, she stuck to the facts regarding the mission, her role in it and the agriculture commission's partnership with Colorado Parks and Wildlife since both started working on reintroduction in 2020. 'It was three years of planning to get to where we are now,' Greenberg said. 'And over that time, there were tough questions for the agriculture commission to answer. But ultimately, (my) commission and the parks and wildlife commission voted on the wolf management plan unanimously. The question now is where do we go from here?'\\u00a0\\n \\nThat seems to be the question on many people's minds when it comes to CPW's delivery of Colorado's newest non-human residents. But Minnesota-bred Greenberg, who fell in love with farming as a city-bred kid with ties to rural America, is juggling other equally crucial issues. There's the federal \\nFarm Bill\\n, a little beat up but surviving through an extension that lasts until September; agriculture's shift to green energy, which some farmers like and others hate; ranchers seeking guidance for how to deal with wolves if and when they discover their livestock; and something that visibly excites Greenberg \\u2014 working to find, develop and invest in young farmers, so Colorado can continue to eat.\\u00a0\\n \\nGreenberg spoke with  about all of this and more on Jan. 9 from her office at Colorado Department of Agriculture HQ in Broomfield, with a view of the snow-frosted Flatirons out her giant window and artwork she won in an auction at the \\nMonte Vista Crane Festival\\n.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nSUN: \\nYou say you loved farming as a kid even though you weren't a 'farm kid.' How did that work?\\u00a0\\n \\nGREENBERG:\\n I grew up both in the city and in the country, surrounded by agriculture, running through cornfields and going to friends' dairies. But I never really thought agriculture was part of my future until a switch flipped when I was a student at Whitman College, and I started working on a farm in Walla Walla, Washington.\\u00a0\\n \\nMy undergrad was in environmental humanities, which involved looking at policy issues more from a human standpoint than a policy standpoint. After graduation, I ended up in Durango working for the \\nNational Young Farmers Coalition\\n.\\u00a0\\n \\nI thought I could just farm my whole life, but I realized that if you're working in agriculture, you're influenced by state, local and federal policies. So after seven years of working with the young farmers coalition, especially on Farm Bill policy, in 2018, when then-Congressman Polis was elected governor, I applied to be on his cabinet, and three weeks later, I was moving to Denver.\\u00a0\\n \\nSUN: \\nI was surprised to hear how involved your office has been with wolf reintroduction from the beginning. Can you explain your role? \\n \\nGREENBERG:\\n For a long time now, the commissioner of agriculture has had a nonvoting ex-officio seat on the Colorado Parks and Wildlife Commission, so I have been involved all throughout the ballot initiative and wolf management planning process. Two of my staff have also been at every technical working group meeting and stakeholder advisory group meeting. And the other element, of course, is I work with livestock producers every day in many capacities.\\u00a0\\n \\nRanching communities are built of tough, gritty folks who know how to get through change and challenging times. But we're not asking them to adapt to this change alone. We want to make sure they know their state agencies are there alongside them, helping provide resources. That's where CDA and CPW's relationship is really going to be showing up in the field, supporting these communities and trying new things to minimize conflict and maximize opportunity for producers.\\u00a0\\n \\nSUN: \\nWhat funding sources support this?\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nGREENBERG:\\n Two we're very much focused on right now are a $2 million \\nRegional Conservation Partnership Program Grant\\n, through USDA (which funds solutions to natural resource challenges on agricultural land) and a budget request through CDA and the governor's budget to add three full-time people to the CDA team. They'll be out in the field with Parks and Wildlife, assisting in the implementation of nonlethal wolf management. The request has been submitted to the legislature, so we'll do everything we can during the legislative session to get that passed.\\u00a0\\n \\nColorado now has one of the most, if not the most, aggressive compensation programs for depredations in any state, with compensation of up to $15,000 per animal as well as veterinary bills. And we have a multiplier because we don't always find every kill. That doesn't necessarily make up for the investment producers are needing to make up front in nonlethal management, but I think it does show a commitment by the Parks and Wildlife Commission and our state to say hey, we know ranchers are going to be coexisting and figuring this out. We want to put real money behind that compensation program.\\u00a0\\n \\nSUN: \\nWhat's going on with the 2023 \\u2014 now 2024 \\u2014 Farm Bill?\\u00a0\\n \\nGREENBERG: \\nThe Farm Bill is the dominant piece of policy that drives agriculture in America. So while there are complications with the 2023 bill, we're seeing more programs for young and beginning farmers. We're seeing more programs for urban agriculture. And of course, the Farm Bill combines \\nthe nutrition title\\n, which is paramount. There are a lot of people who feel this way and I hope that Congress remains true to their commitment to keep those titles together, because we have people who need to eat and people who grow food for all of us who do eat, and that's all part of the same sort of policy package.\\u00a0\\n \\nSUN: \\nWe've heard from a number of agriculture producers who feel the government is being too heavy handed in Colorado's transition to green energy. What do you think?\\u00a0\\n \\nGREENBERG:\\n I think we approach it from a different angle, because we have farmers and ranchers coming to us saying, 'Hey, we want to be part of the renewable energy transition; we just want to do it in a way that allows us to keep growing food.' And we just announced a half-million-dollar research investment into seven projects around the state that are going to advance agriculture, and they are all farmer-led.\\u00a0\\n\\n\\n \\n \\nThere's an amazing \\nagrivoltaic operation\\n in Longmont, \\nJack's Solar Garden\\n, that's doing this at scale and they're trialing both crop production and livestock production underneath the solar panels. Another research project we're investing in are solar fence rows that allow farmers to get their equipment between the rows. So a farmer wouldn't actually have to change the kind of equipment that they use if they want to integrate solar production.\\u00a0\\n \\nAnd we're working with the Colorado Water Conservation Board on an \\naquavoltaic\\n grant, where you can actually install \\nphotovoltaic\\n panels on open ditches or reservoirs, which helps reduce evaporation while generating solar. Those are examples of how we're actually getting a lot of requests for ag to be part of the renewable energy transition and hitting (the state's) goal of having 100% renewable energy by 2040.\\u00a0\\n \\nSUN:\\n Last question. What are you excited about?\\n \\nGREENBERG: \\nWell, we haven't been able to bring down the average age of the farmer in the U.S. and Colorado, but I think we're making some headway in terms of what it means to access the resources you need to enter into agriculture or to stay in it as the next generation.\\n \\nWe're thinking of the continuum. So starting in middle school, kids from all over the state can get hands-on ag science education in our \\nAnimal Health Laboratory\\n.\\n \\nIn the next phase, workforce development, we've created a paid apprenticeship program. You can get up to a year of experience on a farm or ranch and get paid for it.\\u00a0\\n \\nAnd a big one last year was we launched a \\n$20 million revolving loan fund\\n, which is one of the most innovative flexible financing tools for beginning farmers on the market right now. We didn't mean to be but we're at better rates than even the Federal Housing Administration. That's huge because land access is the number one barrier young and beginning farmers face. If you've never owned a business, you don't have equity, and getting access to a loan is very difficult. In the first year of the program, we've been able to lend to about 80 beginning farmers and ranchers.\\u00a0\\n \\nThe last two elements are succession planning and worker outreach. We have a goal of supporting 100 families this year before they start spending money on lawyers and CPAs in the succession process. And we're focusing on worker outreach, because who knows who the folks are that are working for somebody else right now that might someday want to start their own farm, or get into agriculture in a new way.\\n\\n\\n \\nAn interview to provide a relevant perspective, edited for clarity and not fully fact-checked.\",\n",

The 16,000-square-foot all-day food hall will feature eight dining concepts, three retail spaces, an indoor/outdoor bar, indoor/outdoor seating, an expansive patio and event space for up to 40. 'There's nothing like this in Longmont,' said Chris Nehls, vice president of Blackfox Parkway Associates, the company that has owned the building for more than 30 years. 'Though Denver has one of the highest rates of food halls in the country, Longmont has been left out of the fun, until now. We are excited to introduce an elevated go-to space for families, couples, friends and colleagues to spend time together. Beyond the delicious food and drinks, we are making sure that every day offers a new reason to visit, from live music to pop-ups and other special events.' \\n The eight chef-driven vendors will include sushi and ramen offerings, pizza, tacos, barbecue, chicken sandwiches and more, to be operated in the kitchens that Parkway has designed and built out. There will also be a coffee shop that opens at 7 a.m., and an expansive bar with a full wine, beer and cocktail list. Award-winning \\nChile con Quesadilla\\n from Denver (Top Taco Denver winner in 2021 and 2022,) has already signed on, with interest from other popular regional concepts.\\n \\\"Once we were introduced to the idea of Parkway Food Hall, we immediately fell in love with the concept, and we loved the affordability and flexibility of the way the leases are set up, allowing more chefs to have a seat at the table,' said Christina Richardson, chef and co-owner of Chile con Quesadilla. 'As the most award-winning food truck in the state, we're thrilled to have the chance to open a more permanent spot.\\\" Parkway will open in Longmont's Parkway Promenade, one of the city's most historic shopping centers. The principal architect, Meridian 105, is the design mastermind behind Avanti Food & Beverage and Edgewater Public Market. Seasoned food hall veterans National Food Hall Solutions, the operating partner, opened Denver's Junction Food & Drink in 2020, which went on to win the NAIOP's 2020 Retail Development of the Year Award. Construction is led by Faurot Construction. 'We're excited to bring this new destination to Longmont residents and visitors, and we're thrilled to help eight local chefs and restaurateurs achieve success, whether it's through testing a new concept, creating their first brick-and-mortar following food truck success, or setting up a second, third or fourth location,' said National Food Hall Solutions Owner Pat Garza. 'Things are tough for restaurateurs these days, but we're living in a new era where the more expensive traditional brick-and-mortar restaurants aren't the only route to success for chefs.'

      "            \"summary\": \"In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays.\\n\\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colorado \\u2013 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips.\\n\\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds.\\n\\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon.\\n\\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago.\\n\\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level.\\n\\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n\\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop.\\n\\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\"\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on.\\n\\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2013 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\"\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Jimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health.\\n\\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2013 many of mixed immigration status \\u2013 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand.\\n\\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be.\\n\\nWin, win, win\\n\\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill.\\n\\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains.\\n\\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons.\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR Mark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right.\\n\\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says.\\n\\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach.\\n\\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition.\\n\\nA force for good\\n\\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery.\\n\\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says.\\n\\n/ Rachel Woolf for NPR / Rachel Woolf for NPR MacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\"\\n\\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says.\\n\\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people.\\n\\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\"\\n\\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2013 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food.\\n\\nPhotography by Rachel Woolf.

      "            \"summary\": \"Buying an electric vehicle could soon be even cheaper for millions of Coloradans.\\n \\nThe state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of efforts to address climate change. Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility company, is now pushing regulators to allow its customers to tack on additional rebates worth up to $5,500.\\n \\nIf successful, some Colorado residents could theoretically qualify for $19,000 in total discounts, not counting any additional cash available through the federal EV tax credit. As a result, someone could soon combine enough discounts to nearly cover the price of an entry-level EV.\\n \\nXcel Energy, cities like Boulder and Denver, Tesla Motors, and environmental groups claim the benefit will help clean up the transportation sector, the state's largest single source of climate-warming emissions. But consumer advocates and major energy users say energy customers shouldn't be required to subsidize car purchases through their electric bills.\\n \\nThe proposal for 'stackable' rebates would eliminate restrictions that have already frustrated some Colorado EV buyers\\n \\nThat includes Adian Nye, a retired flight instructor and software engineer living in Longmont. After years of driving a Nissan Pathfinder, he resolved that his next car wouldn't be a gas-guzzling SUV.\\n \\nSome online research convinced Nye an EV could fit his budget. From what he could tell, a Telsa Model 3 could qualify for a generous suite of federal and state tax credits \\u2013 plus an additional $5,500 rebate for income-qualified Xcel Energy customers. He appeared to fit the bill based on his current earnings.\\n \\nNye discovered a critical flaw in the system after buying the vehicle last March. While it wasn't mentioned on the utility's public-facing website at the time, some fine print on the rebate application revealed he could not combine the Xcel Energy discount with a $5,000 state tax credit.\\n \\nIn effect, his car wasn't anywhere close to the bargain he'd hoped for.\\n \\n'I felt like I was misled,' Nye said. 'Xcel was making a big deal about this rebate, and it really wasn't offering much of anything.'\\n \\nThe utility now wants regulators to get rid of the rules altogether. If approved later this month, its $437 million proposal would clear a path for a Colorado resident to theoretically collect $26,500 in discounts for a battery-powered vehicle \\u2013 an amount equal to the cost of some entry-level electric cars.\\n \\nXcel Energy claims its plan to use ratepayer money to further subsidize EV purchases would help Colorado achieve its goal of putting 940,000 EVs on the road by 2030\\n \\nWhile the state is a hot spot of EV adoption, recent car registration data show it is only about one-tenth of the way toward the target set by Gov. Jared Polis.\\n \\nTo close the gap, the company has called for a major investment in EV chargers, directing more than half of the nearly half-billion-dollar plan to support charging infrastructure on private properties like apartments and delivery depots.\\n \\nRoughly 4% of the proposed budget would go toward EV rebates, reserving the greatest benefit for low-income residents who often can't afford the higher upfront costs of battery-powered cars.\\n \\nThe proposal would offer an 'income-qualified rebate' worth $5,500 for new cars or $3,000 for used cars. To qualify, customers must earn less than 80% of their county's median income or already participate in specific public benefit programs.\\n \\nA 'community rebate' worth $2,750 for new cars or $1,500 for used cars would be available to customers living in areas defined as 'disproportionately impacted communities.' Those are areas heavily impacted by air and water pollution, which Colorado defines using a mapping tool called EnvroScreen. Tribal members would qualify for the same incentives.\\n \\nAdditional rebates would be available to help local governments and ride-share companies purchase EVs.\\n \\nSupporters of the plan further claim the investments wouldn't have a significant impact on energy bills\\n \\nTyler Bryant, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said the broad support for the proposal reflects agreement on the overall benefits of putting more EVs on the road. Besides reductions in climate-warming emissions and local air pollution, he said more cars plugging into the grid would spread out the cost of providing electricity service, putting downward pressure on energy costs in the long term.\\n \\n'In other words, the growth of electric vehicles more than pays for itself, funds customer programs and utility infrastructure and provides savings to all customers,' Bryant said.\\n \\nThat's a subtle point based on the complex economics of public utilities. A recent state analysis found the plan would likely increase the average residential electricity bill by $. 66 per month over the next three years. The average business will see its monthly costs rise by about $2.27.\\n \\nBut supporters say Xcel Energy's proposal would eventually lead to savings that exceed additional costs on energy bills.\\n \\nTravis Madsen, transportation program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said EVs will help customers avoid costs otherwise spent on gas or vehicle maintenance. In addition, the extra revenue from owners paying for electricity could help cut costs for all ratepayers.\\n \\nFor evidence, he pointed to a 2021 study commissioned by the Colorado Energy Office, which found that additional revenue could cut the average customer utility bill by more than 2% by 2050.\\n \\nThe line of argument has so far failed to convince the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which represents ratepayers before the state utility commission\\n \\nThe office is fighting the proposal along with trail staff for the Public Utilities Commission and large energy consumers. The coalition has argued the proposal lacks a mechanism to guarantee that customers will benefit from lower rates if more vehicles plug into the grid.\\n \\nConsumer advocates also see the EV rebates as unnecessary, given the number of incentives already available in Colorado. Opponents are further concerned Xcel Energy wants to classify vehicle rebates as capital expenses \\u2013 typically reserved things like power plants and transmission lines \\u2013 rather than operating costs.\\n \\nWhile that might sound like a wonky financial distinction, it could allow the company to recover the costs of the EV incentives from customers \\u2013 plus an additional stream of new profit for shareholders.\\n \\nCindy Schonhaut, the director of the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, said the plan violates the long-running compact between the state and investor-owned utilities. Since the Progressive Era, state regulators have tended to only allow companies to profit from major infrastructure investments like power plants and transmission lines. Meanwhile, operating expenses \\u2013 such as staff salaries or coal purchases \\u2013 are passed onto customers without any markups.\\n \\nShe's shocked the utility now wants to claim discounts for privately owned vehicles, which could count as 'infrastructure' and help the company generate a profit. 'What they've proposed is incredibly greedy,' Shonhaut said.\\n \\nXcel Energy posted a record $1.74 billion in profits in 2022, financial filings show, and its quarterly earning reports suggest it will likely beat that mark in 2023.\\n \\nThe Colorado Public Utilities Commission is expected to issue a final decision on the updated program later this Spring.\",\n",

      "            \"summary\": \"In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. \\n \\nCordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. \\u2014 she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips. \\n \\n\\\"This is a green luobo,\\\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds. \\n \\nThese locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon. \\n \\n\\\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\\\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \\n \\nThat vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \\n \\nHealthy soil to healthy population\\n \\nBefore the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop. \\n \\n\\\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\\\" Guttridge laughs. \\\"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\\\" \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nOllin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAround the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on. \\n \\nThe goal of these investments is \\\"really building up our soil health,\\\" he explains. \\\"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food \\u2014 healthy soil grows healthy food.\\\" \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nJimena Cordero is farm manager at Ollin Farms and Mark Guttridge's daughter. She prepares veggies for an upcoming meeting to discuss Boulder County Sustainability.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \\n \\nThat's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families \\u2014 many of mixed immigration status \\u2014 can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \\n \\n\\\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand \\u2013 new people, new families,\\\" Guttridge says. \\\"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\\\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming \\u2013 and how tasty its produce can be. \\n \\nWin, win, win\\n \\nNutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \\n \\nAmy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \\\"It's a triple win,\\\" she explains. \\\"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\\\" she explains. \\n \\nThen again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons. \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMark Guttridge and his daughter, Jimena Cordero, at Ollin Farm in Longmont, Colo.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nHe argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \\n \\n\\\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn \\u2013 they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\\\" Krieger says. \\n \\nGovernments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \\n \\nInstead of sticks, they're using carrots \\u2013 trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \\n \\nA force for good\\n \\nNot far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery. \\n \\nMackenzie Sehlke, the organization's executive director, pulls open the door of a walk-in refrigerator. \\\"A lot of storage crops in here right now,\\\" she says. \\n \\n\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\n \\nMacKenzie Sehlke is the executive director of Boulder County Farmer's Markets.\\n \\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \\\"We have a large Nepalese community here,\\\" she says. \\\"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about \\u2013 will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\\\" \\n \\nHaving people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \\\"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\\\" she says. \\n \\nYes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \\n \\n\\\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\\\" she says. \\\"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\\\" \\nPolicy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident \\u2014 so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food. \\nPhotography by Rachel Woolf.

      "The state already offers generous programs and tax benefits to offset the cost of a new plug-in vehicle as a part of efforts to address climate change. Xcel Energy, the state's largest utility company, is now pushing regulators to allow its customers to tack on additional rebates worth up to $5,500.\n",
      " \n",
      "If successful, some Colorado residents could theoretically qualify for $19,000 in total discounts, not counting any additional cash available through the federal EV tax credit. As a result, someone could soon combine enough discounts to nearly cover the price of an entry-level EV.\n",
      " \n",
      "Xcel Energy, cities like Boulder and Denver, Tesla Motors, and environmental groups claim the benefit will help clean up the transportation sector, the state's largest single source of climate-warming emissions. But consumer advocates and major energy users say energy customers shouldn't be required to subsidize car purchases through their electric bills.\n",

From what he could tell, a Telsa Model 3 could qualify for a generous suite of federal and state tax credits – plus an additional $5,500 rebate for income-qualified Xcel Energy customers. He appeared to fit the bill based on his current earnings.\n",
      " \n",
      "Nye discovered a critical flaw in the system after buying the vehicle last March. While it wasn't mentioned on the utility's public-facing website at the time, some fine print on the rebate application revealed he could not combine the Xcel Energy discount with a $5,000 state tax credit.\n",
      " \n",
      "In effect, his car wasn't anywhere close to the bargain he'd hoped for.\n",

      "'I felt like I was misled,' Nye said. 'Xcel was making a big deal about this rebate, and it really wasn't offering much of anything.'\n",
      " \n",
      "The utility now wants regulators to get rid of the rules altogether. If approved later this month, its $437 million proposal would clear a path for a Colorado resident to theoretically collect $26,500 in discounts for a battery-powered vehicle – an amount equal to the cost of some entry-level electric cars.\n",
      " \n",
      "Xcel Energy claims its plan to use ratepayer money to further subsidize EV purchases would help Colorado achieve its goal of putting 940,000 EVs on the road by 2030\n",
      " \n",
      "While the state is a hot spot of EV adoption, recent car registration data show it is only about one-tenth of the way toward the target set by Gov. Jared Polis.\n",
      " \n",
      "To close the gap, the company has called for a major investment in EV chargers, directing more than half of the nearly half-billion-dollar plan to support charging infrastructure on private properties like apartments and delivery depots.\n",
      " \n",
      "Roughly 4% of the proposed budget would go toward EV rebates, reserving the greatest benefit for low-income residents who often can't afford the higher upfront costs of battery-powered cars.\n",
      " \n",
      "The proposal would offer an 'income-qualified rebate' worth $5,500 for new cars or $3,000 for used cars. To qualify, customers must earn less than 80% of their county's median income or already participate in specific public benefit programs.\n",
      " \n",
      "A 'community rebate' worth $2,750 for new cars or $1,500 for used cars would be available to customers living in areas defined as 'disproportionately impacted communities.' Those are areas heavily impacted by air and water pollution, which Colorado defines using a mapping tool called EnvroScreen. Tribal members would qualify for the same incentives.\n",
      " \n",
      "Additional rebates would be available to help local governments and ride-share companies purchase EVs.\n",
      " \n",
      "Supporters of the plan further claim the investments wouldn't have a significant impact on energy bills\n",
      " \n",
      "Tyler Bryant, an Xcel Energy spokesperson, said the broad support for the proposal reflects agreement on the overall benefits of putting more EVs on the road. Besides reductions in climate-warming emissions and local air pollution, he said more cars plugging into the grid would spread out the cost of providing electricity service, putting downward pressure on energy costs in the long term.\n",
      " \n",
      "'In other words, the growth of electric vehicles more than pays for itself, funds customer programs and utility infrastructure and provides savings to all customers,' Bryant said.\n",
      " \n",
      "That's a subtle point based on the complex economics of public utilities. A recent state analysis found the plan would likely increase the average residential electricity bill by $. 66 per month over the next three years. The average business will see its monthly costs rise by about $2.27.\n",
      " \n",
      "But supporters say Xcel Energy's proposal would eventually lead to savings that exceed additional costs on energy bills.\n",
      " \n",
      "Travis Madsen, transportation program director at the Southwest Energy Efficiency Project, said EVs will help customers avoid costs otherwise spent on gas or vehicle maintenance. In addition, the extra revenue from owners paying for electricity could help cut costs for all ratepayers.\n",
      " \n",
      "For evidence, he pointed to a 2021 study commissioned by the Colorado Energy Office, which found that additional revenue could cut the average customer utility bill by more than 2% by 2050.\n",
      " \n",
      "The line of argument has so far failed to convince the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, which represents ratepayers before the state utility commission\n",
      " \n",
      "The office is fighting the proposal along with trail staff for the Public Utilities Commission and large energy consumers. The coalition has argued the proposal lacks a mechanism to guarantee that customers will benefit from lower rates if more vehicles plug into the grid.\n",
      " \n",
      "Consumer advocates also see the EV rebates as unnecessary, given the number of incentives already available in Colorado. Opponents are further concerned Xcel Energy wants to classify vehicle rebates as capital expenses – typically reserved things like power plants and transmission lines – rather than operating costs.\n",
      " \n",
      "While that might sound like a wonky financial distinction, it could allow the company to recover the costs of the EV incentives from customers – plus an additional stream of new profit for shareholders.\n",
      " \n",
      "Cindy Schonhaut, the director of the Office of the Utility Consumer Advocate, said the plan violates the long-running compact between the state and investor-owned utilities. Since the Progressive Era, state regulators have tended to only allow companies to profit from major infrastructure investments like power plants and transmission lines. Meanwhile, operating expenses – such as staff salaries or coal purchases – are passed onto customers without any markups.\n",
      " \n",
      "She's shocked the utility now wants to claim discounts for privately owned vehicles, which could count as 'infrastructure' and help the company generate a profit. 'What they've proposed is incredibly greedy,' Shonhaut said.\n",
      " \n",
      "Xcel Energy posted a record $1.74 billion in profits in 2022, financial filings show, and its quarterly earning reports suggest it will likely beat that mark in 2023.\n",

      "A big idea for small farms: How to link agriculture, nutrition and public health,Selena Simmons-Duffin,2024-02-03,Boulder, CO,https://www.wlrn.org/npr-breaking-news/2024-02-03/a-big-idea-for-small-farms-how-to-link-agriculture-nutrition-and-public-health,In Boulder, Colo., the county is investing in sustainable farming and helping people buy local produce. It's been called \"a triple win\" – for customers, farmers and the economy.,In a chilly storeroom piled high with fall produce, Jimena Cordero is chopping up vegetables and fanning them out onto trays. \n",
      " \n",
      "Cordero is the farm manager at Ollin Farms, not far from Boulder, Colo. — she's put together bright pink and purple radishes, apple, fresh turnips. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"This is a green luobo,\" she explains, as she expertly cuts the oblong radish into rounds. \n",
      " \n",
      "These locally grown vegetables aren't just pretty. They're being prepared to make a case to state lawmakers at a meeting later that afternoon. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"You can have a super colorful veggie tray for a meeting, and everybody can get on the same vibration, eating the same good, healthy food,\" says Cordero's dad, Mark Guttridge, who started this farm with his wife, Kena, 17 years ago. \n",
      " \n",
      "That vibration and the good, healthy food are part of the case Guttridge wants to make that farmers can play an important role in public health nutrition programs. At the meeting with about a dozen local farmers, two state representatives, and the Colorado commissioner of agriculture, Guttridge will explain how Boulder county has made creative investments in his farm that could be scaled up to the state or even national level. \n",
      " \n",
      "Healthy soil to healthy population\n",
      " \n",
      "Before the meeting, Guttridge shows me one of those investments. A dozen sheep mill about in a field bordered by a simple white fence. The animals, which Guttridge raises for wool, munch on radishes that have been leftover for them. And as they eat, they poop. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"So these guys are out fertilizing the radish field,\" Guttridge laughs. \"They'll be out here a couple more weeks, and then it'll sit for about four or five months. And then we'll just till that in and get our next summer veggies planted right there.\" \n",

      "Ollin Farms received a grant from the county to buy moveable fences, so they could rotate their livestock. As the sheep graze, they leave behind manure that enriches the soil for future crops.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Around the field is a special moveable type of fencing that Ollin Farms bought using grants from the Boulder County Sustainability Office. It allows them to move the sheep from one field to another, fertilizing as they go. He's also used grants for a farm compost system to fertilize the fields that the sheep don't graze on. \n",
      " \n",
      "The goal of these investments is \"really building up our soil health,\" he explains. \"That relates directly to the nutrient quality and nutrient density of the food — healthy soil grows healthy food.\" \n",

      "The county also makes an effort to get that healthy food out to different communities to be able to boost public health. \n",
      " \n",
      "That's where the Boulder County Public Health department comes in. It created a coupon program that low-income families — many of mixed immigration status — can use to get free fruits and vegetables from Ollin Farms' farm stand. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"It's great because it brought a little more diversity to our farm stand – new people, new families,\" Guttridge says. \"We're trying to make it more of a place where people come and get their food, but they also hang out and learn.\" He is hoping the new customers will learn about the values of sustainable farming – and how tasty its produce can be. \n",
      " \n",
      "Win, win, win\n",
      " \n",
      "Nutrition incentive programs, like those public health fruit and vegetable coupons, are spreading all over the country, and most are funded through the federal farm bill. \n",
      " \n",
      "Amy Lazarus Yaroch, executive director at the Gretchen Swanson Center for Nutrition, says these programs generally have broad bipartisan support. \"It's a triple win,\" she explains. \"It's basically good for the consumer who lives in that particular community because they're getting the healthy food, it's good for the farmer, and then it's good for the economy,\" she explains. \n",
      " \n",
      "Then again, these programs only help local farmers if people use their incentives on food that's grown locally. Guttridge says that it's a challenge to compete with cheaper food and produce at the big grocery stores in town, where a lot of people in Boulder and neighboring Longmont go to redeem their fruit and veg coupons. \n",

      "He argues that processed food is already subsidized, so it's not a fair fight. Jim Krieger, executive director of a nonprofit called Healthy Food America, says Guttridge is right. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"There's lots of subsidies for soy and corn – they're key ingredients for ultra-processed foods, which makes their price artificially low relative to fresh fruits and vegetables,\" Krieger says. \n",
      " \n",
      "Governments can use regulations to block people from using their nutrition incentives at big box grocery stores so they're forced to use them in the local food system, but Boulder county isn't taking that approach. \n",
      " \n",
      "Instead of sticks, they're using carrots – trying to make locally farmed produce easier to access and better than the flown-in competition. \n",
      " \n",
      "A force for good\n",
      " \n",
      "Not far from Ollin Farms in Longmont, Colo., Boulder County Farmer's Market uses a big warehouse as a food hub, bringing together produce from lots of different local farms for distribution and delivery. \n",

      "Sehlke argues that one big advantage of buying from local farmers is that they can be responsive to the community. \"We have a large Nepalese community here,\" she says. \"So we're starting to hear more about staple goods from the Nepalese cuisine and thinking about – will someone grow a specific green or a specific tuber for that population?\" \n",
      " \n",
      "Having people from different backgrounds become part of the local food scene pushes farmers to think about what else they can grow, she says. \"I talked to someone who just had gotten a request for Crowder Peas, which are very common in African diaspora cuisine and would grow really beautifully here,\" she says. \n",
      " \n",
      "Yes, she acknowledges, there are plenty of big structural problems with America's food system, but she's proud of what Boulder county has been able to do with local tax revenue to make local produce affordable to more people. \n",
      " \n",
      "\"I think that that local dynamism and that local innovation is pretty cool,\" she says. \"And I've also seen it push the state and other municipalities to think differently.\" \n",
      "Policy can be a force for good, she says, to forge connections between farmer, market and hungry resident — so it's easier and more affordable to eat locally grown food. \n",
